00:00:00,506 --> 00:00:09,496 A:middle
[ Silence ]

2
00:00:09,996 --> 00:00:11,216 A:middle
>> My name is Daniel Kurtz.

3
00:00:11,296 --> 00:00:13,946 A:middle
I'm an iOS engineer on the
Game Center team here at Apple.

4
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:15,976 A:middle
And I'm here to talk
to you today

5
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:17,486 A:middle
about what's new in Game Center.

6
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:21,706 A:middle
So before we really get into
it, let's do a quick recap

7
00:00:21,706 --> 00:00:23,196 A:middle
of what Game Center actually is.

8
00:00:23,906 --> 00:00:27,566 A:middle
Game Center is a gaming platform
which allows the players

9
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:29,816 A:middle
of your games, be they
single player or multiplayer,

10
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:33,606 A:middle
to be able to interact with each
other by tracking their scores

11
00:00:33,606 --> 00:00:35,386 A:middle
and achievements that they'd
been earning in your game,

12
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,736 A:middle
sending challenges to
their friends in order

13
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:39,326 A:middle
to beat those scores
and achievements.

14
00:00:39,946 --> 00:00:42,366 A:middle
And then going even further
with the multiplayer support,

15
00:00:42,366 --> 00:00:45,696 A:middle
we have hosted turn-based gaming
within the game kit framework,

16
00:00:46,256 --> 00:00:48,406 A:middle
as well as real-time
multiplayer matchmaking.

17
00:00:49,606 --> 00:00:52,636 A:middle
Now, Game Center has been
incredibly successful.

18
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,176 A:middle
You might have heard the
other day that we have

19
00:00:54,176 --> 00:00:57,036 A:middle
over 240 million
players in Game Center,

20
00:00:57,656 --> 00:00:59,126 A:middle
and they're playing games both

21
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:02,896 A:middle
on their iOS devices
as well as on OS X.

22
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

23
00:01:03,516 --> 00:01:06,556 A:middle
So we've-- when I
asked you what's new

24
00:01:06,556 --> 00:01:08,636 A:middle
in Game Center this year,
perhaps the first thing

25
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:10,736 A:middle
that comes to mind
is our brand new UI

26
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:12,636 A:middle
for our Game Center
app on iPhone.

27
00:01:13,626 --> 00:01:15,536 A:middle
And we're very happy
about this UI.

28
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:17,196 A:middle
We think it's very
exciting and fun.

29
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,286 A:middle
But we're not stopping here.

30
00:01:19,406 --> 00:01:20,936 A:middle
We've got a lot of things going

31
00:01:20,936 --> 00:01:24,046 A:middle
on under the covers new
this year for Game Center

32
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:27,176 A:middle
that you can take advantage
of within your game in order

33
00:01:27,176 --> 00:01:29,046 A:middle
to make it even further
integrated

34
00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:30,306 A:middle
and social with your players.

35
00:01:31,696 --> 00:01:34,006 A:middle
So today, we've got a
large grab back of topics

36
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:36,016 A:middle
that we're going to talk about.

37
00:01:36,016 --> 00:01:39,066 A:middle
First up is the Game
Center in-game experience

38
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:40,746 A:middle
with the GK Game
Center view controller.

39
00:01:41,686 --> 00:01:44,346 A:middle
We also have a lot of new
changes regarding leaderboards

40
00:01:44,346 --> 00:01:46,606 A:middle
and scores, Leaderboard Sets,

41
00:01:46,736 --> 00:01:48,786 A:middle
as well as Most Recent
Score Leaderboards,

42
00:01:48,786 --> 00:01:50,746 A:middle
a new type of leaderboard
that allows you

43
00:01:50,746 --> 00:01:51,946 A:middle
to track scores in a new way.

44
00:01:53,176 --> 00:01:55,636 A:middle
Also, because we're talking
so much about scores today,

45
00:01:55,826 --> 00:01:57,546 A:middle
we have improved
security measures

46
00:01:57,546 --> 00:01:59,566 A:middle
to help you limit
cheating within your game.

47
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

48
00:02:00,376 --> 00:02:02,896 A:middle
And building on top of both
scores and achievements,

49
00:02:02,946 --> 00:02:04,816 A:middle
we've improved challenges
even further

50
00:02:05,316 --> 00:02:07,606 A:middle
to make it more immersive
for your players.

51
00:02:08,606 --> 00:02:10,765 A:middle
And then, finally,
last but not the least,

52
00:02:10,765 --> 00:02:12,076 A:middle
we're going to round
it out of talking

53
00:02:12,076 --> 00:02:16,856 A:middle
about how you can take advantage
of handling local player events

54
00:02:17,206 --> 00:02:19,886 A:middle
and some fundamental API
changes that we've done

55
00:02:20,136 --> 00:02:22,026 A:middle
with how you can respond
to events relevant

56
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:23,326 A:middle
to the local player
of your game.

57
00:02:24,176 --> 00:02:25,776 A:middle
So let's get right into it.

58
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:28,466 A:middle
Let's talk about the Game
Center in-game experience.

59
00:02:29,736 --> 00:02:32,596 A:middle
And you probably all already
know this game, perhaps,

60
00:02:32,596 --> 00:02:34,626 A:middle
it's the in-game menu
for Temple Run 2.

61
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:37,346 A:middle
And on that right
column in the middle row,

62
00:02:37,346 --> 00:02:38,436 A:middle
it's the leaderboards button.

63
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,066 A:middle
Now, today, if you were
to pull out your iPhone

64
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:43,516 A:middle
and play this game and tap
that leaderboard button,

65
00:02:43,806 --> 00:02:46,016 A:middle
up would pop the GK Game
Center view controller,

66
00:02:46,686 --> 00:02:49,516 A:middle
giving you the ability to take a
look at your leaderboard scores,

67
00:02:49,516 --> 00:02:51,496 A:middle
your achievements, perhaps
new challenges you've earned.

68
00:02:52,366 --> 00:02:55,366 A:middle
In iOS 7, that same
thing still happens

69
00:02:55,696 --> 00:02:57,106 A:middle
and we've updated the look,

70
00:02:57,106 --> 00:02:59,846 A:middle
the UI of the GK Game
Center view controller

71
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

72
00:03:00,936 --> 00:03:02,306 A:middle
in a very radical way.

73
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,716 A:middle
We feel that this makes
it much more ingrained,

74
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:07,636 A:middle
much more embedded
within Temple Run 2.

75
00:03:07,936 --> 00:03:10,996 A:middle
As you can see, Temple
Run 2's screen still shows

76
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:11,916 A:middle
through in the background.

77
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:15,936 A:middle
However, the same information is
still available to your players.

78
00:03:15,936 --> 00:03:18,776 A:middle
You still have the same list
of leaderboards, can still look

79
00:03:18,776 --> 00:03:20,576 A:middle
at the achievements that
your players have earned

80
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:22,506 A:middle
or currently endeavoring
to earn,

81
00:03:22,576 --> 00:03:25,166 A:middle
and the challenges they've
gotten from their friends,

82
00:03:25,516 --> 00:03:28,196 A:middle
as well as the ability to rate
the game within the App Store

83
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:31,376 A:middle
up in the top left or like the
game on Facebook if they wish.

84
00:03:32,276 --> 00:03:35,836 A:middle
So programmatically,
nothing has really changed

85
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:36,686 A:middle
as to how you're going

86
00:03:36,686 --> 00:03:38,926 A:middle
to present the GK Game
Center view controller.

87
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:43,236 A:middle
It's the same exact API
that you'd be using before

88
00:03:43,776 --> 00:03:45,336 A:middle
with a little bit of a wrinkle

89
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:47,276 A:middle
when you're thinking
about performance.

90
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:48,736 A:middle
So let's take a look
at some code.

91
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:51,886 A:middle
Let's say that you have
a target action setup

92
00:03:51,886 --> 00:03:55,666 A:middle
for that leaderboard button in
your game and you want to hear

93
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:56,856 A:middle
when that button is tapped

94
00:03:57,026 --> 00:03:58,716 A:middle
to show the Game
Center view controller.

95
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,846 A:middle
Well, in your target
action method,

96
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

97
00:04:01,846 --> 00:04:04,406 A:middle
the first thing you're going to
do is grab the shared instance

98
00:04:04,406 --> 00:04:06,006 A:middle
for the GK Game Center
view controller,

99
00:04:06,306 --> 00:04:07,596 A:middle
setting up the delegate to cells

100
00:04:07,596 --> 00:04:09,186 A:middle
so that you can dismiss
it appropriately,

101
00:04:10,156 --> 00:04:11,176 A:middle
set up your view state

102
00:04:11,176 --> 00:04:14,226 A:middle
to whatever appropriate initial
view state you wish to show.

103
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:16,516 A:middle
And here's a little
bit of a wrinkle,

104
00:04:16,516 --> 00:04:18,036 A:middle
the throttle rendering call.

105
00:04:18,036 --> 00:04:19,586 A:middle
We'll get into that
in just a moment.

106
00:04:19,646 --> 00:04:21,755 A:middle
And then, finally, you're going

107
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:23,816 A:middle
to present the view
controller just like you would

108
00:04:23,816 --> 00:04:25,856 A:middle
with any other UIView
controller within you game.

109
00:04:25,856 --> 00:04:29,196 A:middle
Now that throttle rendering call
that I'm talking about, right?

110
00:04:30,056 --> 00:04:32,886 A:middle
As I mentioned, the GK
Game Center view controller

111
00:04:32,886 --> 00:04:35,516 A:middle
with iOS 7 is partially
transparent.

112
00:04:36,556 --> 00:04:38,266 A:middle
Moreover, it's also
doing some blurring

113
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:40,406 A:middle
and other heavy compositing
on the GPU.

114
00:04:40,886 --> 00:04:44,036 A:middle
So in order to make this
present as smoothly as possible

115
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:46,346 A:middle
so that players can get in
and out of the menu and back

116
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:48,706 A:middle
to playing your game,
you don't really need

117
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:52,056 A:middle
to be running graphics at 60
frames per second and you're

118
00:04:52,056 --> 00:04:53,766 A:middle
about to push this
view controller over.

119
00:04:54,246 --> 00:04:56,906 A:middle
So you can step back in
the gas pedal a little bit

120
00:04:56,906 --> 00:04:58,646 A:middle
and let the view
controller present,

121
00:04:59,106 --> 00:05:02,476 A:middle
dismiss when you need to,
and get right back to it.

122
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

123
00:05:02,826 --> 00:05:04,406 A:middle
So really, that's
all that's changed

124
00:05:04,406 --> 00:05:05,996 A:middle
with the GK Game
Center view controller.

125
00:05:06,336 --> 00:05:11,166 A:middle
It's really just the exact
same API with a brand new look

126
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,546 A:middle
that we feel really makes it

127
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:15,196 A:middle
that much more ingrained
within your game.

128
00:05:16,546 --> 00:05:19,716 A:middle
So let's move on to the
next new topic of today.

129
00:05:20,496 --> 00:05:21,636 A:middle
Leaderboard Sets.

130
00:05:22,526 --> 00:05:24,176 A:middle
This is something we're
very excited about.

131
00:05:25,156 --> 00:05:29,116 A:middle
Today, on-- in iOS 6 device
or on OS X Mountain Lion,

132
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:32,286 A:middle
your game currently has
at most 25 leaderboards

133
00:05:32,286 --> 00:05:34,426 A:middle
that it can define and
use on Game Center.

134
00:05:35,756 --> 00:05:37,026 A:middle
Now, I'm happy to tell you

135
00:05:37,576 --> 00:05:40,406 A:middle
that we have increased
this maximum limit

136
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,156 A:middle
to 100 leaderboards.

137
00:05:42,556 --> 00:05:45,436 A:middle
You can have at most 100
leaderboards in a flat list

138
00:05:45,856 --> 00:05:47,506 A:middle
that your game can
use in Game Center.

139
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,506 A:middle
And we're not stopping there.

140
00:05:50,326 --> 00:05:52,876 A:middle
With this new feature that
we have, Leaderboard Sets,

141
00:05:53,126 --> 00:05:55,776 A:middle
we're increasing actually
the maximum amount

142
00:05:55,776 --> 00:05:58,426 A:middle
of leaderboards you can use
within your game twentyfold

143
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:00,536 A:middle
to 500 maximum leaderboards.

144
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

145
00:06:01,406 --> 00:06:03,346 A:middle
And now, with Leaderboard Sets,

146
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:05,736 A:middle
we're introducing an
organizational hierarchy,

147
00:06:05,736 --> 00:06:08,046 A:middle
a structure that you can
impose on these leaderboards.

148
00:06:08,626 --> 00:06:11,266 A:middle
You can think of Leaderboard
Sets as a tagging architecture

149
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:14,226 A:middle
where a single leaderboard can
belong to many different sets,

150
00:06:14,826 --> 00:06:17,406 A:middle
and likewise, a single
set can contain many

151
00:06:17,406 --> 00:06:18,456 A:middle
different leaderboards.

152
00:06:19,256 --> 00:06:21,646 A:middle
Then you have at most
100 sets that you can use

153
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:24,126 A:middle
within your game and at
most 100 leaderboards

154
00:06:24,126 --> 00:06:26,186 A:middle
that you can put
in a single set.

155
00:06:26,816 --> 00:06:29,016 A:middle
So why are we asking you

156
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:32,396 A:middle
to use Leaderboard Sets before
you can actually unlock the full

157
00:06:32,396 --> 00:06:34,616 A:middle
500 leaderboards for
use within your game?

158
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:37,526 A:middle
It actually comes down
to usability issue.

159
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:41,006 A:middle
Let's say you've got a Water
Planet group of stages, right?

160
00:06:41,426 --> 00:06:43,336 A:middle
And also, for this
group of stages,

161
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,796 A:middle
you have a boss level
at the end.

162
00:06:45,136 --> 00:06:47,936 A:middle
And maybe you've also
got different levels

163
00:06:47,936 --> 00:06:49,586 A:middle
of difficulty-- easy,
medium, hard.

164
00:06:49,586 --> 00:06:52,036 A:middle
So one possible leaderboard

165
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,296 A:middle
that your game has is the
Water Planet Boss Level

166
00:06:54,296 --> 00:06:55,236 A:middle
Medium leaderboard.

167
00:06:56,176 --> 00:06:58,926 A:middle
You, being the endeavoring game
developer that you are, however,

168
00:06:58,926 --> 00:07:02,106 A:middle
also have 499 other leaderboards

169
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

170
00:07:02,316 --> 00:07:03,486 A:middle
that you've made
within your game.

171
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:06,556 A:middle
So when a player wants to
go and checkout their score

172
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:08,696 A:middle
on the Water Planet Boss
Level Medium leaderboard,

173
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:11,786 A:middle
either within your game,
the Game Center application,

174
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:13,776 A:middle
or the GK Game Center
view controller,

175
00:07:14,116 --> 00:07:17,426 A:middle
how are they supposed to find
this leaderboard amongst all

176
00:07:17,426 --> 00:07:18,636 A:middle
500 leaderboards?

177
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:22,036 A:middle
It really comes down to a needle
in a haystack problem, right?

178
00:07:23,036 --> 00:07:27,086 A:middle
So what sets allow us to
do is to organize this

179
00:07:27,086 --> 00:07:30,186 A:middle
into meaningful groups of
data to make it a lot easier

180
00:07:30,186 --> 00:07:31,226 A:middle
for players to parse

181
00:07:31,226 --> 00:07:32,656 A:middle
when they're looking
through your game.

182
00:07:33,296 --> 00:07:36,366 A:middle
Here's an example from the GK
Game Center view controller

183
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:39,606 A:middle
for this game, where when the
player taps the leaderboard

184
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:43,156 A:middle
segment, the first thing that
they are shown is the list

185
00:07:43,156 --> 00:07:44,816 A:middle
of Leaderboard Sets
within the game.

186
00:07:45,556 --> 00:07:49,006 A:middle
Then if we were to tap that
Water Planet set up at the top,

187
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:51,746 A:middle
the very next screen would
show all the leaderboards

188
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:54,066 A:middle
that are contained within
the Water Planet set.

189
00:07:54,466 --> 00:07:56,476 A:middle
Pretty straightforward, right?

190
00:07:57,296 --> 00:08:02,126 A:middle
So let's consider how we
could actually put this single

191
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

192
00:08:02,126 --> 00:08:04,206 A:middle
leaderboard into various sets

193
00:08:04,206 --> 00:08:07,386 A:middle
and how we can start imposing
some order to the chaos

194
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:08,606 A:middle
of these 500 leaderboards.

195
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:12,686 A:middle
Well, right off the bat, we
have three pretty obvious ways

196
00:08:12,686 --> 00:08:14,626 A:middle
or three pretty obvious sets

197
00:08:14,626 --> 00:08:16,666 A:middle
that we could organize a
single leaderboard into.

198
00:08:18,406 --> 00:08:20,816 A:middle
One characteristic of this
leaderboard is that it belongs

199
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:23,516 A:middle
to the Water Planet group
of stages within the game.

200
00:08:24,246 --> 00:08:26,336 A:middle
There's also the boss
level for the Water Planet,

201
00:08:26,556 --> 00:08:28,396 A:middle
and its medium difficulty.

202
00:08:28,566 --> 00:08:30,856 A:middle
So right there, that's
three different sets

203
00:08:30,856 --> 00:08:32,816 A:middle
that this leaderboard
could belong to.

204
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:36,256 A:middle
And while this leaderboard
could belong to these sets,

205
00:08:36,256 --> 00:08:39,285 A:middle
we could also add all the
other leaderboards that belong

206
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:40,696 A:middle
to these appropriate
sets as well.

207
00:08:42,476 --> 00:08:45,366 A:middle
So the Water Planet set
contains all the stages

208
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:49,266 A:middle
for Water Planet-- water
boss, medium, et cetera.

209
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,376 A:middle
So just like with leaderboards,

210
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:56,336 A:middle
Leaderboard Sets can have
names of players saved.

211
00:08:57,586 --> 00:09:00,786 A:middle
And moreover, depending
upon the set

212
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

213
00:09:00,786 --> 00:09:02,486 A:middle
that a leaderboard
is contained within,

214
00:09:02,636 --> 00:09:05,536 A:middle
the name for that individual
leaderboard can change as well.

215
00:09:06,556 --> 00:09:08,956 A:middle
So let's take a look
at the examples

216
00:09:09,056 --> 00:09:11,286 A:middle
of what this actually
means and how it works.

217
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:15,536 A:middle
So we go back to these three
sets that we've defined

218
00:09:15,536 --> 00:09:17,786 A:middle
that the Water Boss Medium
Level leaderboard can be

219
00:09:17,786 --> 00:09:18,486 A:middle
contained within.

220
00:09:18,956 --> 00:09:22,866 A:middle
In Water Planet set, we could
simply just name Water Planet,

221
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:27,176 A:middle
and that Water Boss Medium Level
leaderboard, when it's contained

222
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:30,426 A:middle
within the Water Planet, that
is when the player has navigated

223
00:09:30,426 --> 00:09:32,756 A:middle
to the Water Planet set to
look at this leaderboard,

224
00:09:33,466 --> 00:09:35,736 A:middle
we could just display
the string boss medium.

225
00:09:36,216 --> 00:09:39,816 A:middle
From here, it's clear that
this is the Boss Medium Level

226
00:09:39,816 --> 00:09:42,806 A:middle
leaderboard for the Water
Planet group of stages.

227
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:44,986 A:middle
There's no redundant
information.

228
00:09:44,986 --> 00:09:46,486 A:middle
Everything is very
much contextual.

229
00:09:47,616 --> 00:09:50,646 A:middle
And we can go and name all the
other leaderboards appropriately

230
00:09:50,646 --> 00:09:51,626 A:middle
for that set as well.

231
00:09:53,036 --> 00:09:55,936 A:middle
Then the Water Boss Set,
just call it Water Boss.

232
00:09:56,066 --> 00:09:58,976 A:middle
That same leaderboard when
it's in the Water Boss Set,

233
00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:01,116 A:middle
we only have to call it medium

234
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

235
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,516 A:middle
because it's obvious it's the
medium level of difficulty

236
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:03,976 A:middle
for the water boss set.

237
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:07,146 A:middle
We go and name all
the other leaderboards

238
00:10:07,146 --> 00:10:08,156 A:middle
in that set appropriately.

239
00:10:08,276 --> 00:10:09,416 A:middle
And then you're getting
the picture

240
00:10:09,486 --> 00:10:11,806 A:middle
with medium set, call it medium.

241
00:10:11,806 --> 00:10:15,616 A:middle
And we could call this
one stage Water Boss.

242
00:10:16,336 --> 00:10:19,056 A:middle
And name all the other
medium level leaderboards

243
00:10:19,276 --> 00:10:21,386 A:middle
in the medium set
appropriately as well.

244
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,986 A:middle
So we've gone and we've
given this single leaderboard

245
00:10:25,056 --> 00:10:27,386 A:middle
different names depending
upon the way the players have

246
00:10:27,386 --> 00:10:28,636 A:middle
actually navigated to it.

247
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:31,966 A:middle
But it's still the
exact same leaderboard.

248
00:10:32,756 --> 00:10:36,216 A:middle
That is, regardless of the
path that players happen to go

249
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:41,436 A:middle
or take in order to find this
leaderboard, the exact same list

250
00:10:41,436 --> 00:10:43,456 A:middle
of scores is going to be
displayed to the user.

251
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,436 A:middle
It's just really UI
customization option

252
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:48,766 A:middle
that you have at your
disposal in order

253
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:52,846 A:middle
to make information
contextual and not redundant.

254
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:57,436 A:middle
So let's take a look at how
we can actually set your game

255
00:10:57,436 --> 00:11:00,056 A:middle
up in iTunes Connect in
order to use Leaderboard Sets

256
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

257
00:11:00,136 --> 00:11:02,096 A:middle
and start organizing
the leaderboards

258
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:04,026 A:middle
of your game into these sets.

259
00:11:04,786 --> 00:11:05,706 A:middle
We're going to take a very,

260
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,546 A:middle
very quick blow-by-blow
quick flyover here.

261
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:10,376 A:middle
I definitely urge you to check

262
00:11:10,376 --> 00:11:12,476 A:middle
out the iTunes Connect
session tomorrow, however,

263
00:11:12,476 --> 00:11:14,986 A:middle
if you want to get more
detail as how you can set

264
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:16,366 A:middle
up Leaderboard Sets
within your game.

265
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:21,696 A:middle
So in the Game Center page for
your game on iTunes Connect,

266
00:11:22,196 --> 00:11:25,386 A:middle
in the leaderboard section of
that page is this new button,

267
00:11:25,616 --> 00:11:27,586 A:middle
Move All Leaderboards
into Display Sets.

268
00:11:28,286 --> 00:11:31,886 A:middle
When you click this button,
you're going to be asked

269
00:11:31,886 --> 00:11:34,836 A:middle
to create the very
first set for your game.

270
00:11:35,616 --> 00:11:38,356 A:middle
And now, the first thing that
you're going to have to do

271
00:11:38,356 --> 00:11:41,226 A:middle
when you're creating this
set is to find a handle.

272
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,966 A:middle
This is really just the
name that you're going

273
00:11:44,966 --> 00:11:46,556 A:middle
to be referring to this set

274
00:11:46,556 --> 00:11:48,756 A:middle
when you're configuring
it on iTunes Connect.

275
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:51,586 A:middle
This isn't the same as the
string that players are going

276
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:52,976 A:middle
to see when they're
using your game.

277
00:11:53,216 --> 00:11:54,756 A:middle
It's really just a
convenience for you.

278
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,046 A:middle
Then, after creating that
handle, that Set Reference Name,

279
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:04,246 A:middle
you're going to have to
create a leaderboard set ID.

280
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

281
00:12:04,486 --> 00:12:08,486 A:middle
Just like leaderboards, you have
to create a unique identifier

282
00:12:08,486 --> 00:12:10,446 A:middle
for your set on iTunes Connect.

283
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,626 A:middle
And we suggest that
you create it

284
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:14,836 A:middle
as a reverse DNS style string.

285
00:12:14,836 --> 00:12:17,286 A:middle
So in this case, for
the Water Planet set,

286
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,656 A:middle
we're going to give it
this reverse DNS string.

287
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:21,566 A:middle
Now, after that,
you've created a set.

288
00:12:22,816 --> 00:12:25,776 A:middle
And from creating a set, you
actually have to give it a name

289
00:12:25,776 --> 00:12:27,506 A:middle
that is going to be
displayed to your players.

290
00:12:28,806 --> 00:12:31,316 A:middle
So the very next step you're
going to have to take is

291
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:35,386 A:middle
within the Display Set
Localization portion

292
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:37,106 A:middle
of the screen after
creating the set,

293
00:12:37,736 --> 00:12:39,366 A:middle
there's an Add Language
button here.

294
00:12:40,856 --> 00:12:42,816 A:middle
And you need to then go

295
00:12:42,816 --> 00:12:47,906 A:middle
and create language-specific
display names for this set.

296
00:12:48,146 --> 00:12:52,876 A:middle
So we could take, say,
English as the first language

297
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:56,186 A:middle
that we're going to define
a name for, for this set.

298
00:12:56,956 --> 00:13:00,226 A:middle
We're going to name this Water
Planet set just Water Planet,

299
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

300
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:01,586 A:middle
liked we talked about
in the example.

301
00:13:01,586 --> 00:13:06,516 A:middle
And then we can also create an
English locale-specific image

302
00:13:06,516 --> 00:13:09,576 A:middle
that we wish to be displayed
to players when they're looking

303
00:13:09,576 --> 00:13:12,016 A:middle
at this set on English
locale devices.

304
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:15,746 A:middle
And then, further, if
you're creating your games

305
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,296 A:middle
for multiple languages
either now or in the future,

306
00:13:18,816 --> 00:13:22,646 A:middle
you can create other
localizations as you see fit.

307
00:13:23,796 --> 00:13:26,576 A:middle
So after you've created the
display name for this set,

308
00:13:26,776 --> 00:13:28,866 A:middle
the next thing you need to
do is actually start adding

309
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:32,486 A:middle
leaderboards in your
game into this set.

310
00:13:32,996 --> 00:13:34,806 A:middle
So you'll see another
part on the screen

311
00:13:34,806 --> 00:13:37,496 A:middle
that says Leaderboards in This
Set with Add to Set button.

312
00:13:38,156 --> 00:13:41,146 A:middle
Clicking that button, you're
going to be asked to select one

313
00:13:41,146 --> 00:13:43,046 A:middle
of the leaderboards that
you've already defined

314
00:13:43,046 --> 00:13:43,896 A:middle
in iTunes Connect.

315
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:47,766 A:middle
Let's take that Water Boss
Medium Level leaderboard.

316
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:51,116 A:middle
And then you're going to have
to give that leaderboard a name

317
00:13:51,386 --> 00:13:53,846 A:middle
when it's being displayed
within the Water Planet set.

318
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:59,156 A:middle
So again, you choose a
language, give, in this case,

319
00:13:59,196 --> 00:14:00,796 A:middle
the English language
string that's going

320
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

321
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:02,006 A:middle
to be displayed to your players.

322
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:03,916 A:middle
And then either now
or in the future,

323
00:14:04,286 --> 00:14:06,116 A:middle
go and give other
languages if you decide

324
00:14:06,116 --> 00:14:08,026 A:middle
to localize your game
for multiple locales.

325
00:14:08,546 --> 00:14:12,296 A:middle
So that's really all there is to
it for actually setting up sets

326
00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:13,066 A:middle
within iTunes Connect.

327
00:14:13,906 --> 00:14:16,156 A:middle
Now, using Leaderboard
Sets programmatically

328
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:18,666 A:middle
with the Game Kit Framework
is very straightforward.

329
00:14:19,936 --> 00:14:23,086 A:middle
We nowhave a GK Leaderboard
Set class

330
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:26,066 A:middle
and it defines three fundamental
properties that you're going

331
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,086 A:middle
to have to care about
when you're using sets

332
00:14:28,306 --> 00:14:29,086 A:middle
within your game.

333
00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:32,536 A:middle
The first is an NSString title.

334
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,936 A:middle
Now this is really just the
display name that you set

335
00:14:34,936 --> 00:14:36,646 A:middle
up on iTunes Connect
for your set.

336
00:14:37,196 --> 00:14:39,926 A:middle
And if your game is running
on an English locale device,

337
00:14:39,926 --> 00:14:42,296 A:middle
it's going to display the
English name, Japanese

338
00:14:42,296 --> 00:14:43,816 A:middle
or Japanese name, et
cetera, et cetera,

339
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:47,856 A:middle
just like how leaderboard
titles work today as well.

340
00:14:49,136 --> 00:14:51,136 A:middle
Then you're going to have
your NSString identifier.

341
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:55,486 A:middle
This is just the set ID that
you defined on iTunes Connect.

342
00:14:55,486 --> 00:14:58,666 A:middle
And, as well, optionally,
there's the group identifier.

343
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:02,066 A:middle
Now we didn't talk about this
in the iTunes Connect overview,

344
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

345
00:15:02,516 --> 00:15:05,946 A:middle
but just like how leaderboards
work with game groups,

346
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,526 A:middle
a feature that we
introduced last year,

347
00:15:08,246 --> 00:15:09,896 A:middle
so too do Leaderboard Sets.

348
00:15:10,336 --> 00:15:11,896 A:middle
And we're not really
going to talk a whole lot

349
00:15:11,896 --> 00:15:14,056 A:middle
about the group identifier
in game groups

350
00:15:14,056 --> 00:15:17,126 A:middle
with Leaderboard Sets today,
but I definitely urge you again

351
00:15:17,206 --> 00:15:18,976 A:middle
to check out the iTunes
Connect session tomorrow

352
00:15:18,976 --> 00:15:21,116 A:middle
for more detail on that.

353
00:15:21,496 --> 00:15:23,786 A:middle
So we've got the GK
Leaderboard Set class.

354
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:26,606 A:middle
Just like GK Leaderboard
objects before,

355
00:15:26,606 --> 00:15:28,656 A:middle
you can actually use
the sets that you've set

356
00:15:28,656 --> 00:15:30,256 A:middle
up on iTunes Connect
within your game.

357
00:15:30,646 --> 00:15:33,886 A:middle
The very first thing you need
to do is load all the sets

358
00:15:33,886 --> 00:15:34,806 A:middle
that belong to your game.

359
00:15:35,806 --> 00:15:38,246 A:middle
And you can do that calling
Load Leaderboard Sets

360
00:15:38,246 --> 00:15:39,126 A:middle
with Completion Handler.

361
00:15:40,056 --> 00:15:42,646 A:middle
Now, when your completion
handler is called, you're going

362
00:15:42,646 --> 00:15:46,286 A:middle
to be passed back an NSArray
of GK Leaderboard set instances.

363
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,816 A:middle
And from there, you're on free.

364
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:50,586 A:middle
You can do anything
that you wish

365
00:15:50,586 --> 00:15:52,236 A:middle
with these leaderboard
set objects.

366
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,476 A:middle
For instance, you can
load the leaderboards

367
00:15:55,476 --> 00:15:57,016 A:middle
that are contained
within those sets.

368
00:15:57,796 --> 00:16:00,276 A:middle
So when this completion handler
is called, we can take one

369
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

370
00:16:00,276 --> 00:16:01,576 A:middle
of the sets that
we've been given back.

371
00:16:02,846 --> 00:16:04,516 A:middle
And to load the leaderboards
that are contained

372
00:16:04,516 --> 00:16:07,286 A:middle
within that set, we could
call Load Leaderboard

373
00:16:07,356 --> 00:16:09,996 A:middle
with Completion Handler
or Load Leaderboards

374
00:16:09,996 --> 00:16:10,816 A:middle
with Completion Handler.

375
00:16:11,756 --> 00:16:14,376 A:middle
And when that completion
handler is called back,

376
00:16:14,376 --> 00:16:17,316 A:middle
you'll be provided an NSArray
of GK Leaderboard instances.

377
00:16:18,246 --> 00:16:20,796 A:middle
And now I'm assuming that
you're already familiar

378
00:16:20,796 --> 00:16:23,136 A:middle
with GK Leaderboard
objects, from this point,

379
00:16:23,136 --> 00:16:24,636 A:middle
you can treat these objects just

380
00:16:24,636 --> 00:16:26,906 A:middle
like you would any other
GK Leaderboard object

381
00:16:26,906 --> 00:16:28,836 A:middle
within your game.

382
00:16:29,026 --> 00:16:29,926 A:middle
One other thing that you can do

383
00:16:29,926 --> 00:16:33,346 A:middle
with GK Leaderboard set
instances is to load the image

384
00:16:33,346 --> 00:16:35,636 A:middle
that you upload with
iTunes Connect for that set.

385
00:16:36,466 --> 00:16:38,826 A:middle
So within this Load
Leaderboard Sets

386
00:16:38,826 --> 00:16:41,406 A:middle
with Completion Handler called
back, you could take one

387
00:16:41,406 --> 00:16:43,996 A:middle
of those sets and call Load
Image with Completion Handler.

388
00:16:44,616 --> 00:16:47,746 A:middle
And that completion handler will
pass back a GK image object.

389
00:16:49,156 --> 00:16:52,196 A:middle
So a GK image object is
really just a typedef.

390
00:16:52,196 --> 00:16:54,576 A:middle
If you're running on iOS,
then that's going to point

391
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:58,476 A:middle
to UIImage, if you're running
on OS X, they'll be an NSImage.

392
00:16:58,906 --> 00:17:00,926 A:middle
And once this completion
handler is called back,

393
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

394
00:17:00,926 --> 00:17:03,036 A:middle
you can use it just like
any other image asset

395
00:17:03,036 --> 00:17:03,686 A:middle
within your game.

396
00:17:04,246 --> 00:17:07,576 A:middle
So that's Leaderboard Sets.

397
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:11,435 A:middle
Again, it's-- you can think of
them as a tagging architecture.

398
00:17:11,496 --> 00:17:15,185 A:middle
It allows you to group multiple
leaderboards into a set.

399
00:17:15,546 --> 00:17:17,156 A:middle
A single leaderboard
can be contained

400
00:17:17,156 --> 00:17:18,526 A:middle
within many different sets.

401
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:21,866 A:middle
An important thing that I
wish to pint out here is

402
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:24,715 A:middle
that if you wish to unlock
all 500 leaderboards, that is,

403
00:17:24,915 --> 00:17:27,425 A:middle
if you wish to adopt Leaderboard
Sets within your game,

404
00:17:27,955 --> 00:17:30,576 A:middle
then you must make sure
that every leaderboard

405
00:17:30,576 --> 00:17:35,546 A:middle
that you create within your game
is a member of at least one set.

406
00:17:36,516 --> 00:17:39,086 A:middle
So let's move on to the next new
thing with leaderboards today,

407
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:41,556 A:middle
Most Recent Score Leaderboards.

408
00:17:42,356 --> 00:17:44,726 A:middle
So you're all probably
already familiar

409
00:17:44,726 --> 00:17:46,766 A:middle
with how leaderboards
work within Game Center,

410
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,656 A:middle
the best score ranking system.

411
00:17:49,216 --> 00:17:51,746 A:middle
That is, if you've got
an ascending leaderboard

412
00:17:51,746 --> 00:17:53,306 A:middle
or ascending sort
order leaderboard,

413
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:56,756 A:middle
and your player happens to
earn 10,000 points today,

414
00:17:56,756 --> 00:18:00,276 A:middle
then tomorrow, when they
score 5,000 points, let's say,

415
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

416
00:18:00,606 --> 00:18:04,916 A:middle
5,000 isn't better than 10,000,
so 10,000 is going to remain

417
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:08,206 A:middle
on the all-time time span
for that leaderboard.

418
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:10,876 A:middle
Or what if you want to
implement a leaderboard

419
00:18:10,876 --> 00:18:13,416 A:middle
where scores can both go
up and down over the course

420
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,366 A:middle
of people playing your
game, like batting average.

421
00:18:16,626 --> 00:18:18,716 A:middle
If you want to track your
player's batting average

422
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:20,216 A:middle
over a season, that's going

423
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:22,926 A:middle
to not just be monotonically
increasing or decreasing,

424
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:24,916 A:middle
it's actually going
to be increasing

425
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,566 A:middle
or decreasing over time.

426
00:18:26,776 --> 00:18:29,376 A:middle
So that's what a Most Recent
Score Leaderboard allows you

427
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:30,126 A:middle
to do.

428
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:33,246 A:middle
Most Recent Score Leaderboards,
they're just an alternative

429
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:34,586 A:middle
to Best Score Leaderboards.

430
00:18:35,046 --> 00:18:37,306 A:middle
And the way that they function
should be pretty obvious

431
00:18:37,306 --> 00:18:37,906 A:middle
by the name.

432
00:18:38,226 --> 00:18:41,306 A:middle
It's just that the next score
that you submit to a leaderboard

433
00:18:41,306 --> 00:18:43,726 A:middle
for your player, that's going
to be the score that shows

434
00:18:43,726 --> 00:18:45,546 A:middle
up on the leaderboard
in Game Center.

435
00:18:46,566 --> 00:18:51,346 A:middle
So really, what this means, it's
actually a very profound effect

436
00:18:51,346 --> 00:18:55,616 A:middle
of this is that it allows you
to take full 100 percent control

437
00:18:55,616 --> 00:18:57,966 A:middle
over the ranking system
for this leaderboard.

438
00:18:58,656 --> 00:19:01,216 A:middle
You could do things like power
rankings for your chess game

439
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

440
00:19:01,216 --> 00:19:03,376 A:middle
or your legendary
RPG Heroes game.

441
00:19:03,986 --> 00:19:06,846 A:middle
You could do win/lose
percentage or even, you know,

442
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:10,496 A:middle
simpler things like batting
average or golf strokes or OPS.

443
00:19:10,846 --> 00:19:12,356 A:middle
Really, it's entirely up to you.

444
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:15,596 A:middle
And setting up a Most
Recent Score Leaderboard

445
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:18,236 A:middle
for your game is really
just a single checkbox away

446
00:19:18,236 --> 00:19:20,976 A:middle
on iTunes Connect.

447
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:23,166 A:middle
Within the Leaderboard
Configuration screen

448
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,556 A:middle
on iTunes Connect when you're
creating a new leaderboard,

449
00:19:26,176 --> 00:19:28,296 A:middle
you'll notice that there's a
new field here called Score

450
00:19:28,296 --> 00:19:29,006 A:middle
Submission Type.

451
00:19:29,706 --> 00:19:33,406 A:middle
Now by default, that Best Score
field is going to be clicked.

452
00:19:34,186 --> 00:19:38,536 A:middle
However, if you click the Most
Recent Score checkbox right

453
00:19:38,586 --> 00:19:41,096 A:middle
there, that instantly
turns this leaderboard

454
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,786 A:middle
into a Most Recent
Score Leaderboard.

455
00:19:43,756 --> 00:19:45,666 A:middle
Now you may already be familiar

456
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:49,016 A:middle
with the Sort Order field
right below, we've had this

457
00:19:49,016 --> 00:19:51,076 A:middle
for a long while already.

458
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:54,346 A:middle
Sort Order is just as applicable

459
00:19:54,636 --> 00:19:56,906 A:middle
to Most Recent Score
Leaderboards as it is

460
00:19:56,906 --> 00:19:58,286 A:middle
to Best Score Leaderboards.

461
00:19:59,016 --> 00:20:02,296 A:middle
If you say set this
to low to high,

462
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

463
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:03,746 A:middle
then the lowest scores are going

464
00:20:03,746 --> 00:20:04,976 A:middle
to get the best ranks
on this leaderboard.

465
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:09,196 A:middle
So using baseball,
again, as an example,

466
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:12,166 A:middle
if you want to track ERA, you'd
probably want it to be low

467
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,126 A:middle
to high because lower is better.

468
00:20:14,696 --> 00:20:16,646 A:middle
High to low for batting average.

469
00:20:16,646 --> 00:20:19,486 A:middle
You want it so that the highest
scores get the best ranks.

470
00:20:20,476 --> 00:20:24,296 A:middle
So Most Recent Score
Leaderboards programmatically

471
00:20:24,296 --> 00:20:25,436 A:middle
are identical.

472
00:20:25,476 --> 00:20:28,946 A:middle
100 percent identical to
regular best score leaderboards

473
00:20:29,046 --> 00:20:30,106 A:middle
in the Game Kit Framework.

474
00:20:31,036 --> 00:20:33,556 A:middle
However, since you are
now being given the power

475
00:20:33,556 --> 00:20:36,706 A:middle
to entirely customize the
ranking system that's afforded

476
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:39,426 A:middle
to you, there's a lot of
things that you could do

477
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,616 A:middle
when you're preparing these
scores for submission.

478
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:46,186 A:middle
So let's take a look at an
example of what you could do.

479
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:48,916 A:middle
Let's say that you want to
create a power ranking system,

480
00:20:49,006 --> 00:20:53,216 A:middle
that is, you have a
multiplayer game and you've got

481
00:20:53,216 --> 00:20:56,206 A:middle
like a ladder ranking system
within your game so that

482
00:20:56,206 --> 00:20:58,996 A:middle
if a high-rank player and a
low-rank player play each other

483
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:02,106 A:middle
in a match and the low-rank
player happens to win,

484
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

485
00:21:02,356 --> 00:21:04,496 A:middle
then the low-rank player's
rank is going to jump

486
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:08,516 A:middle
up the difference of those two
players' ranks, and vice versa,

487
00:21:08,516 --> 00:21:10,226 A:middle
the high-rank player,
because he lost,

488
00:21:10,226 --> 00:21:11,766 A:middle
is going to drop
by the difference.

489
00:21:12,866 --> 00:21:15,576 A:middle
Well, what we could do here
programmatically is at the end

490
00:21:15,886 --> 00:21:20,016 A:middle
of the match, we could
load the leaderboard scores

491
00:21:20,016 --> 00:21:22,706 A:middle
for those two players, the local
player and the other player,

492
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:26,456 A:middle
setting the identifier for
the GK Leaderboard object

493
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,796 A:middle
to that Most Recent Score
Leaderboard identifier you've

494
00:21:28,796 --> 00:21:31,636 A:middle
set up on iTunes Connect.

495
00:21:31,726 --> 00:21:34,446 A:middle
So once you've loaded the
scores with completion handler

496
00:21:34,446 --> 00:21:35,976 A:middle
and your completion
handler is called back,

497
00:21:36,726 --> 00:21:38,306 A:middle
you can grab the score values

498
00:21:38,306 --> 00:21:40,316 A:middle
for both the local player
and the other player.

499
00:21:41,236 --> 00:21:45,936 A:middle
And then, based upon the
previous power ranking, that is,

500
00:21:45,936 --> 00:21:48,936 A:middle
the local player's value
of the local player

501
00:21:48,936 --> 00:21:51,216 A:middle
and the previous ranking of
the other player's value,

502
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:53,446 A:middle
as well as the outcome

503
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:56,026 A:middle
of the match whether the local
player happened to win or lose,

504
00:21:56,376 --> 00:21:59,056 A:middle
you can create a new
local player score value.

505
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

506
00:22:00,276 --> 00:22:02,976 A:middle
Then from there, you
submit these scores just

507
00:22:02,976 --> 00:22:04,276 A:middle
like you would any other score

508
00:22:04,276 --> 00:22:06,036 A:middle
to any other regular
old leaderboard.

509
00:22:06,676 --> 00:22:10,656 A:middle
You allocate a native score
with the leaderboard identifier

510
00:22:10,656 --> 00:22:13,526 A:middle
for the Most Recent Score
Leaderboard, you set the value

511
00:22:13,526 --> 00:22:16,456 A:middle
to the new local player's
value, and then, finally,

512
00:22:16,456 --> 00:22:18,626 A:middle
you call report scores
passing in an array

513
00:22:18,736 --> 00:22:20,056 A:middle
with that local player's score.

514
00:22:21,836 --> 00:22:24,286 A:middle
So, really, that's all there is

515
00:22:24,286 --> 00:22:26,456 A:middle
to Most Recent Score
Leaderboards.

516
00:22:26,796 --> 00:22:30,516 A:middle
It's very, very similar
to how you would work

517
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,686 A:middle
with Best Score leaderboards
programmatically,

518
00:22:33,036 --> 00:22:35,406 A:middle
but since there's so much
else that you can do in order

519
00:22:35,406 --> 00:22:39,006 A:middle
to customize the
ranking system, really,

520
00:22:39,006 --> 00:22:42,976 A:middle
the opportunities are
endless as to what it can do.

521
00:22:43,026 --> 00:22:45,216 A:middle
So while we're in the
neighborhood of GK Leaderboard

522
00:22:45,366 --> 00:22:48,356 A:middle
and its API, I just want to
touch on a couple of changes

523
00:22:48,356 --> 00:22:50,996 A:middle
that we have this year with iOS
7 for the Game Kit Framework.

524
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:53,206 A:middle
First of all, you
may be familiar

525
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,336 A:middle
with the GK Leaderboard
Category property.

526
00:22:55,706 --> 00:22:59,596 A:middle
That was a pointer for basically
the NSString identifier

527
00:22:59,596 --> 00:23:00,846 A:middle
that you set up on
iTunes Connect.

528
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

529
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:05,206 A:middle
We're deprecating this in favor
of the identifier property.

530
00:23:05,256 --> 00:23:06,996 A:middle
And the reason is basically

531
00:23:06,996 --> 00:23:10,466 A:middle
because with GK Leaderboard
Sets, sets and categories,

532
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:12,886 A:middle
they sound sort of familiar
or similar to each other,

533
00:23:12,886 --> 00:23:16,096 A:middle
so in order to, you know,
allay any confusion,

534
00:23:16,096 --> 00:23:17,776 A:middle
we're deprecating the
category property.

535
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,786 A:middle
You may also be familiar with
the Set Default Leaderboard

536
00:23:21,786 --> 00:23:23,126 A:middle
with Completion Handler Call

537
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:25,396 A:middle
on GK Leaderboard
as a class method.

538
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:29,526 A:middle
Now, this basically allowed
you to make it such that

539
00:23:29,526 --> 00:23:32,536 A:middle
when a player is viewing your
game within the Game Center app,

540
00:23:32,926 --> 00:23:35,136 A:middle
that the very first leaderboard
that they're presented

541
00:23:35,136 --> 00:23:38,516 A:middle
with within your game detail
view is the leaderboard

542
00:23:38,516 --> 00:23:39,206 A:middle
that you're choosing.

543
00:23:39,996 --> 00:23:42,586 A:middle
But since this is something that
isn't so much of the property

544
00:23:42,586 --> 00:23:45,266 A:middle
of the leaderboard, but
much more the local player,

545
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:49,326 A:middle
we're deprecating the GK
Leaderboard method in favor

546
00:23:49,326 --> 00:23:53,076 A:middle
of GK Local Player Set
Default Leaderboard Identifier

547
00:23:53,216 --> 00:23:54,306 A:middle
Completion Handler method.

548
00:23:54,426 --> 00:23:56,966 A:middle
So use that instead in
case you're interested.

549
00:23:58,476 --> 00:24:02,206 A:middle
So we've talked a lot about
new leaderboard features today,

550
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

551
00:24:02,206 --> 00:24:04,416 A:middle
Leaderboard Sets, to
increase the maximum amount

552
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:05,626 A:middle
of leaderboards that
you can use,

553
00:24:06,016 --> 00:24:08,116 A:middle
as well as Most Recent
Score Leaderboards,

554
00:24:08,456 --> 00:24:11,356 A:middle
and new ranking systems that
you can create using them.

555
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:14,086 A:middle
Let's take a quick
peek under the hood

556
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:17,496 A:middle
as to how actual
score submission works

557
00:24:17,636 --> 00:24:20,096 A:middle
in the Game Kit Framework
in the Game Center platform,

558
00:24:21,006 --> 00:24:22,226 A:middle
and what's going
on under the hood

559
00:24:22,226 --> 00:24:23,896 A:middle
when you're communicating
with Game Center.

560
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:28,666 A:middle
So when your game is running
and it's making submissions

561
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:31,286 A:middle
to Game Center, whether it's
running on an iOS device

562
00:24:31,286 --> 00:24:35,646 A:middle
or an OS X system, it's
actually not alone.

563
00:24:35,646 --> 00:24:37,356 A:middle
We have a daemon called gamed

564
00:24:37,716 --> 00:24:39,276 A:middle
that is always running
in the background.

565
00:24:39,276 --> 00:24:42,106 A:middle
And when your game
is communicating

566
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,696 A:middle
through the Game Kit Framework
with the Game Center platform,

567
00:24:44,926 --> 00:24:47,866 A:middle
transparently, as in you don't
need to remember any of this,

568
00:24:48,126 --> 00:24:50,996 A:middle
transparently, your game
is actually establishing a

569
00:24:50,996 --> 00:24:53,066 A:middle
connection with gamed,
our daemon.

570
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:56,876 A:middle
Then in turn, gamed is
establishing a connection

571
00:24:56,876 --> 00:24:58,966 A:middle
with the Game Center
servers in the outside world.

572
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,196 A:middle
So when you submit
a score, let's say,

573
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

574
00:25:02,946 --> 00:25:04,546 A:middle
to the Game Center system,

575
00:25:05,446 --> 00:25:08,176 A:middle
you're actually submitting
that to gamed.

576
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:11,876 A:middle
And now, gamed is going
to automatically relay

577
00:25:11,876 --> 00:25:13,486 A:middle
that to the Game Center server.

578
00:25:14,606 --> 00:25:15,806 A:middle
So why do we do this?

579
00:25:16,746 --> 00:25:20,216 A:middle
Well, let's say, for instance,
that internet connectivity

580
00:25:20,216 --> 00:25:23,636 A:middle
of the device happens to be
lost, and thus, the connection

581
00:25:23,636 --> 00:25:25,876 A:middle
with the Game Center
server is separate.

582
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,696 A:middle
Well, for any score submissions
or achievement submissions

583
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:33,046 A:middle
or any other type of submissions
happen to fail because of this,

584
00:25:33,346 --> 00:25:35,856 A:middle
gamed will automatically
store those requests

585
00:25:35,856 --> 00:25:36,496 A:middle
that you're making.

586
00:25:37,176 --> 00:25:39,656 A:middle
Any of the failed ones
or any of the future ones

587
00:25:39,656 --> 00:25:42,986 A:middle
that you're making to game d,
your game doesn't need to worry

588
00:25:43,056 --> 00:25:45,486 A:middle
about internet connect--
internet connectivity,

589
00:25:45,816 --> 00:25:48,336 A:middle
gamed is always just
there managing it for you.

590
00:25:49,236 --> 00:25:52,066 A:middle
So that when Game Center
server, the connection

591
00:25:52,066 --> 00:25:53,926 A:middle
with the server happens
to be reestablished

592
00:25:53,926 --> 00:25:55,366 A:middle
and the device comes
back online,

593
00:25:56,246 --> 00:25:58,226 A:middle
or even if your game happens

594
00:25:58,226 --> 00:26:00,726 A:middle
to go offline before these
submissions make it over,

595
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

596
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:04,456 A:middle
gamed is going to immediately go

597
00:26:04,456 --> 00:26:06,226 A:middle
and forward those
score submissions

598
00:26:06,746 --> 00:26:10,276 A:middle
over to the Game Center
server on your behalf.

599
00:26:10,356 --> 00:26:12,276 A:middle
Really, you don't need to
worry about any of this,

600
00:26:12,276 --> 00:26:14,186 A:middle
it's all done transparently
for you.

601
00:26:15,626 --> 00:26:18,326 A:middle
So you may be familiar
with the report scores

602
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:22,756 A:middle
with completion handler API
and how our completion handler,

603
00:26:22,756 --> 00:26:26,306 A:middle
as a signature, such that it can
pass back an NSError object.

604
00:26:27,326 --> 00:26:28,776 A:middle
This is largely vestigial.

605
00:26:29,526 --> 00:26:31,546 A:middle
This whole store and
forward mechanism

606
00:26:31,546 --> 00:26:33,516 A:middle
with the gamed daemon
is something

607
00:26:33,516 --> 00:26:35,576 A:middle
that we introduced in iOS 5.

608
00:26:36,766 --> 00:26:39,006 A:middle
So it's been running
up through today.

609
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:43,596 A:middle
As long as your score and/or if
you're submitting achievements,

610
00:26:43,596 --> 00:26:45,526 A:middle
your achievements
happen to be in it

611
00:26:45,686 --> 00:26:48,886 A:middle
with the proper consistent
identifier that you set

612
00:26:48,886 --> 00:26:51,376 A:middle
up on iTunes Connect,
you don't need to worry

613
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,796 A:middle
about checking this NS
error object and its value.

614
00:26:54,586 --> 00:26:56,446 A:middle
We're actually not going
to hand one back to you.

615
00:26:56,946 --> 00:26:59,846 A:middle
In the past, before we
implement the store and forward,

616
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

617
00:27:00,116 --> 00:27:01,996 A:middle
we used to ask you
to check to see

618
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:03,796 A:middle
if there was an internet
connectivity error

619
00:27:03,796 --> 00:27:04,836 A:middle
that was handed back to you.

620
00:27:05,076 --> 00:27:07,616 A:middle
And if so, we asked you
to actually do the storing

621
00:27:07,846 --> 00:27:10,016 A:middle
and forwarding of
these requests later.

622
00:27:10,756 --> 00:27:12,176 A:middle
But you don't need to do that.

623
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:14,186 A:middle
You haven't had to
do that since iOS 5.

624
00:27:14,986 --> 00:27:17,426 A:middle
So if you've got a code
like that within your game,

625
00:27:17,426 --> 00:27:18,636 A:middle
definitely take it out.

626
00:27:19,546 --> 00:27:20,346 A:middle
You don't have to worry

627
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:22,006 A:middle
about caching your
scores and achievements.

628
00:27:22,506 --> 00:27:23,906 A:middle
In fact, we definitely
urge you not

629
00:27:23,906 --> 00:27:25,276 A:middle
to because there
are complications

630
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,096 A:middle
that can arise with challenges.

631
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:30,416 A:middle
Just the moment that your
player has earned the score

632
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:32,066 A:middle
and achievement,
submit right away.

633
00:27:32,656 --> 00:27:35,186 A:middle
Give it over to gamed, it'll
do the heavy lifting for you.

634
00:27:36,096 --> 00:27:39,376 A:middle
And that being said, if you're
submitting multiple scores

635
00:27:39,376 --> 00:27:41,866 A:middle
for a single play-through
session, like, let's say,

636
00:27:42,076 --> 00:27:44,746 A:middle
your player is going to be
earning coins in the session,

637
00:27:45,026 --> 00:27:48,686 A:middle
they're also going to be getting
a track time around the level,

638
00:27:48,686 --> 00:27:50,026 A:middle
and then finally,
you're also going

639
00:27:50,026 --> 00:27:52,406 A:middle
to be submitting another
score for their high score

640
00:27:52,406 --> 00:27:54,946 A:middle
in that level, then those
are three different scores,

641
00:27:54,946 --> 00:27:57,686 A:middle
you should batch those into
a single NSArray and pass

642
00:27:57,686 --> 00:27:59,686 A:middle
that in via report
scores method.

643
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

644
00:28:00,176 --> 00:28:03,876 A:middle
So that's what new
in leaderboards.

645
00:28:03,876 --> 00:28:05,066 A:middle
A lot of new stuff.

646
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:07,916 A:middle
We've got many more leaderboards
with Leaderboard Sets,

647
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:10,586 A:middle
up to 500 leaderboards that you
can define within your game.

648
00:28:10,796 --> 00:28:13,626 A:middle
We also have Most Recent Score
Leaderboards that allow you

649
00:28:13,626 --> 00:28:16,016 A:middle
to create custom ranking
solutions for your game.

650
00:28:16,826 --> 00:28:18,916 A:middle
And we also took a quick
peek under the hood

651
00:28:18,916 --> 00:28:21,216 A:middle
of how gamed works when
you're submitting scores

652
00:28:21,436 --> 00:28:23,416 A:middle
and also achievements
and other requests

653
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:26,576 A:middle
to the Game Center platform,
and how we do the heavy lifting

654
00:28:26,576 --> 00:28:29,506 A:middle
for you so you don't have to
worry about this caching logic

655
00:28:29,506 --> 00:28:30,626 A:middle
and network connectivity.

656
00:28:31,036 --> 00:28:34,086 A:middle
You just have to submit your
scores and then get right

657
00:28:34,086 --> 00:28:37,796 A:middle
on to letting players
play your game.

658
00:28:37,986 --> 00:28:40,666 A:middle
So we've talked a lot
about leaderboards today

659
00:28:41,176 --> 00:28:44,266 A:middle
on a very related topic that I
think dovetails pretty nicely.

660
00:28:44,496 --> 00:28:46,986 A:middle
Let's talk about how we can
limit cheating within your game.

661
00:28:48,296 --> 00:28:52,186 A:middle
Now you may all be familiar a
bit with screens such as this.

662
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:55,256 A:middle
In case you don't recognize

663
00:28:55,256 --> 00:28:57,256 A:middle
that there's some
suspicious score values here.

664
00:28:57,566 --> 00:29:00,876 A:middle
I don't think, you know, the
six top players or however many

665
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

666
00:29:00,876 --> 00:29:03,686 A:middle
in this game happened to
have earned in 64 max,

667
00:29:03,756 --> 00:29:06,366 A:middle
but I don't think that's
actually ever humanly possible.

668
00:29:07,316 --> 00:29:10,256 A:middle
So clearly, something
suspicious is going on here

669
00:29:10,256 --> 00:29:11,776 A:middle
and it probably means
that there are people

670
00:29:11,776 --> 00:29:12,686 A:middle
who are cheating in the game.

671
00:29:13,556 --> 00:29:16,446 A:middle
I'm happy to tell you
today that with iOS 7,

672
00:29:16,446 --> 00:29:19,906 A:middle
we are doing three things
in order to help you limit

673
00:29:19,906 --> 00:29:21,486 A:middle
and combat cheating
within your game.

674
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,926 A:middle
And the first is
completely free for you.

675
00:29:24,926 --> 00:29:28,186 A:middle
When your game is
submitting scores to gamed

676
00:29:28,186 --> 00:29:33,076 A:middle
on an iOS 7 device, when it
reaches gamed and gamed goes

677
00:29:33,076 --> 00:29:35,456 A:middle
to relay that score to
the Game Center server,

678
00:29:35,496 --> 00:29:39,166 A:middle
it is automatically attaching
a cryptographic signature

679
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:40,826 A:middle
to the score submission, as well

680
00:29:40,826 --> 00:29:42,526 A:middle
as other submissions
like achievements.

681
00:29:43,036 --> 00:29:46,046 A:middle
So that if a nefarious player
happens to go and tamper

682
00:29:46,046 --> 00:29:48,276 A:middle
with that submission
when it's in midstream

683
00:29:48,276 --> 00:29:51,026 A:middle
to the Game Center servers,
that's going to get picked

684
00:29:51,026 --> 00:29:54,106 A:middle
up automatically and
Game Center is going

685
00:29:54,106 --> 00:29:55,576 A:middle
to reject that score outright.

686
00:29:56,576 --> 00:29:57,736 A:middle
That's free for you.

687
00:29:57,736 --> 00:30:00,836 A:middle
You don't have to do any sort of
coding or configuration steps.

688
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

689
00:30:01,096 --> 00:30:03,216 A:middle
If your game is running
on iOS 7, we've gotten

690
00:30:03,216 --> 00:30:04,526 A:middle
that taken care of for you.

691
00:30:05,446 --> 00:30:07,646 A:middle
Now another thing that
you can do in order

692
00:30:07,646 --> 00:30:09,406 A:middle
to help limit cheating
within your game

693
00:30:09,596 --> 00:30:13,646 A:middle
like from an exploit
level or angle is

694
00:30:13,766 --> 00:30:16,016 A:middle
with the Score Range property

695
00:30:16,116 --> 00:30:18,776 A:middle
on the Leaderboard Configuration
screen in iTunes Connect.

696
00:30:20,056 --> 00:30:22,326 A:middle
If you've got a leaderboard
where it's only believable

697
00:30:22,326 --> 00:30:27,816 A:middle
or only humanly possible for
a player to legitimately earn

698
00:30:27,856 --> 00:30:31,826 A:middle
at most 10,000 points within
that leaderboard on your game,

699
00:30:32,616 --> 00:30:35,496 A:middle
then I definitely suggest
that you set that To Value

700
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:38,236 A:middle
in the Score Range
field to 10,000.

701
00:30:38,766 --> 00:30:43,256 A:middle
What this does is it essentially
creates a visible score range

702
00:30:43,496 --> 00:30:45,656 A:middle
for scores within your
leaderboard for that game.

703
00:30:46,326 --> 00:30:49,686 A:middle
And what I mean by that is if a
player happens to submit, say,

704
00:30:49,796 --> 00:30:51,656 A:middle
one billion points
to this leaderboard,

705
00:30:51,966 --> 00:30:53,956 A:middle
when it's really only
humanly possible for them

706
00:30:53,956 --> 00:30:55,856 A:middle
to earn 10,000 legitimately,

707
00:30:56,516 --> 00:30:58,236 A:middle
then the Game Center
server is going to accept

708
00:30:58,236 --> 00:31:01,476 A:middle
that score submission, it's
just not going to be visible

709
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

710
00:31:01,476 --> 00:31:02,946 A:middle
to other players of the game

711
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:04,246 A:middle
when they're looking
at that leaderboard.

712
00:31:05,226 --> 00:31:08,576 A:middle
So we're hanging on to
these scores, right?

713
00:31:09,366 --> 00:31:12,356 A:middle
There are a lot of reasons,
one is because circumstances

714
00:31:12,356 --> 00:31:14,246 A:middle
within your game
might actually change.

715
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,536 A:middle
You might realize that you
forgot to carry the one,

716
00:31:16,536 --> 00:31:19,356 A:middle
for instance, when you're trying
out your game design docs,

717
00:31:19,736 --> 00:31:21,986 A:middle
and you realized that it's
actually totally allowable

718
00:31:21,986 --> 00:31:24,626 A:middle
and believable for a player to
earn at most a billion points

719
00:31:24,626 --> 00:31:25,496 A:middle
within this leaderboard.

720
00:31:26,096 --> 00:31:28,226 A:middle
So at a later time, you
can come back to the screen

721
00:31:28,226 --> 00:31:31,236 A:middle
in iTunes Connect, vamp that
To field up to a billion,

722
00:31:31,236 --> 00:31:35,266 A:middle
and that player's score
that was earlier hidden

723
00:31:35,266 --> 00:31:37,616 A:middle
by the Game Center server
will now become visible.

724
00:31:38,516 --> 00:31:41,466 A:middle
So this isn't an
unforgiving configuration set.

725
00:31:41,926 --> 00:31:46,406 A:middle
It's just another arrow in your
quiver to help limit cheating

726
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:48,976 A:middle
and exploits within your
game, but it will allow you

727
00:31:48,976 --> 00:31:51,356 A:middle
to backtrack in case
you decide that, "No,

728
00:31:51,356 --> 00:31:53,206 A:middle
it's totally OK all along."

729
00:31:54,416 --> 00:31:58,636 A:middle
The third thing that we are
providing you with iOS 7

730
00:31:58,946 --> 00:32:00,476 A:middle
and OS X with iTunes Connect

731
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

732
00:32:00,476 --> 00:32:04,256 A:middle
to help limit cheating is a
brand new configuration tool

733
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,206 A:middle
within iTunes Connect.

734
00:32:05,936 --> 00:32:08,726 A:middle
And this tool is going to help
you audit suspicious player

735
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:10,616 A:middle
activity on your
leaderboards of your game.

736
00:32:10,616 --> 00:32:12,366 A:middle
And now, we've got
a lot of things

737
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:13,456 A:middle
that we're talking about today.

738
00:32:13,746 --> 00:32:16,396 A:middle
So I definitely urge you
to check out what's new

739
00:32:16,396 --> 00:32:18,436 A:middle
on iTunes Connect session
tomorrow 'cause they're going

740
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,816 A:middle
to go into in-depth as to
how you're going to be able

741
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:23,686 A:middle
to actively manage player
activity within your game,

742
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:26,036 A:middle
'cause you know you're
being best, you made it.

743
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:27,566 A:middle
And it's a living
breathing thing

744
00:32:27,566 --> 00:32:29,746 A:middle
so you understand it
as it's being played.

745
00:32:30,456 --> 00:32:32,366 A:middle
So with this tool, you'll
be able to make sure

746
00:32:32,366 --> 00:32:34,006 A:middle
that everything is
running smoothly.

747
00:32:35,776 --> 00:32:39,166 A:middle
So that's what's new in
security for Game Center.

748
00:32:39,786 --> 00:32:42,286 A:middle
We've got signed submissions,
this is totally free for you.

749
00:32:42,286 --> 00:32:44,146 A:middle
We are signing every
submission we're making

750
00:32:44,146 --> 00:32:46,286 A:middle
to the Game Center
platform and to the server.

751
00:32:46,516 --> 00:32:48,336 A:middle
So if anybody happens
to tamper with it,

752
00:32:48,506 --> 00:32:51,586 A:middle
when it leaves the device and
goes off into the internet,

753
00:32:52,056 --> 00:32:53,826 A:middle
we're going to detect that on
the other end and we're going

754
00:32:53,826 --> 00:32:55,256 A:middle
to reject those submissions
outright.

755
00:32:56,386 --> 00:32:59,296 A:middle
Definitely, I suggest you
use the Score Range field

756
00:32:59,366 --> 00:33:03,226 A:middle
within iTunes Connect on the
Leaderboard Configuration screen

757
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

758
00:33:03,476 --> 00:33:07,706 A:middle
in order to filter out
anybody who's exploiting issues

759
00:33:07,706 --> 00:33:08,416 A:middle
within your game.

760
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:12,096 A:middle
And then finally, we've got a
new management tool that's going

761
00:33:12,096 --> 00:33:14,566 A:middle
to allow you to help audit
suspicious player activity.

762
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:17,456 A:middle
And you can find out
more about that tomorrow.

763
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:24,276 A:middle
So we've gone through new
leaderboard features as well

764
00:33:24,276 --> 00:33:27,286 A:middle
as how we can help you limit
cheating within your game

765
00:33:27,286 --> 00:33:28,386 A:middle
if it's Game Center enabled.

766
00:33:29,016 --> 00:33:32,106 A:middle
Let's move on to the next
topic today-- Challenges.

767
00:33:33,256 --> 00:33:35,186 A:middle
So Challenges was
a brand new feature

768
00:33:35,186 --> 00:33:37,876 A:middle
that we introduced last
year, and we've been thrilled

769
00:33:37,956 --> 00:33:41,546 A:middle
with the uptake and adoption
of challenges in your games.

770
00:33:42,226 --> 00:33:45,386 A:middle
And we introduced, again, last
year with iOS 6 Mountain Lion.

771
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:48,776 A:middle
And what it really does is
whether your game is a single

772
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:49,996 A:middle
player or a multiplayer,

773
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:53,576 A:middle
challenges add a competitive
element to your game.

774
00:33:54,106 --> 00:33:56,566 A:middle
If your game support
leaderboards or achievements

775
00:33:56,566 --> 00:33:59,566 A:middle
within Game Center, and
players can challenge each other

776
00:33:59,896 --> 00:34:02,716 A:middle
to either meet or beat
those leaderboard scores

777
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

778
00:34:02,886 --> 00:34:04,736 A:middle
or to earn those achievements
that they've earned.

779
00:34:04,736 --> 00:34:08,065 A:middle
And this was also supported
automatically whether

780
00:34:08,065 --> 00:34:11,016 A:middle
through the Game Center
app on iOS or OS X

781
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:15,025 A:middle
or through the GK Game Center
view controller, players that go

782
00:34:15,025 --> 00:34:18,076 A:middle
through our UI, select their
scores, challenge their friends

783
00:34:18,076 --> 00:34:19,996 A:middle
to beat those scores,
same with achievements,

784
00:34:20,706 --> 00:34:22,666 A:middle
and players would start
receiving notifications

785
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:24,626 A:middle
and would complete
everything, and it was great.

786
00:34:25,616 --> 00:34:29,536 A:middle
We also provided you, however,
with API to extend your game

787
00:34:29,536 --> 00:34:32,416 A:middle
for custom challenge
gameplay to hook into events

788
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:34,116 A:middle
when players happen to
complete a challenge,

789
00:34:34,446 --> 00:34:37,025 A:middle
and also to allow you to issue
challenges programmatically

790
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:37,676 A:middle
within your game.

791
00:34:38,806 --> 00:34:42,556 A:middle
So before we talk about what's
new in Challenges this year,

792
00:34:43,136 --> 00:34:44,206 A:middle
let's just do a quick run

793
00:34:44,206 --> 00:34:45,856 A:middle
through of how Challenges
work currently.

794
00:34:46,806 --> 00:34:49,906 A:middle
So let's say Tom is playing
a racing game and he happens

795
00:34:49,906 --> 00:34:52,636 A:middle
to earn a lap time of 50
seconds around the track.

796
00:34:53,646 --> 00:34:55,706 A:middle
Then he could challenge
Alice to go

797
00:34:55,706 --> 00:34:57,516 A:middle
and beat his lap
time of 50 seconds.

798
00:34:57,516 --> 00:34:59,596 A:middle
So he sends a challenge
to Alice.

799
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

800
00:35:00,446 --> 00:35:03,846 A:middle
Alice gets that challenge
and she opens up your game,

801
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,476 A:middle
and she happens to play that
same track getting a score

802
00:35:06,476 --> 00:35:09,256 A:middle
of 40-second lap time.

803
00:35:09,446 --> 00:35:12,006 A:middle
Now, 40 seconds is
better than 50 seconds,

804
00:35:12,006 --> 00:35:14,436 A:middle
so Alice has completed
that challenge.

805
00:35:14,436 --> 00:35:16,316 A:middle
She gets a push notification
to her device

806
00:35:16,316 --> 00:35:17,846 A:middle
from the Game Center
server telling her

807
00:35:17,846 --> 00:35:19,006 A:middle
that she just beat
the challenge.

808
00:35:19,396 --> 00:35:21,966 A:middle
Automatically in the background,
since the score challenge,

809
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:25,656 A:middle
Tom gets a new challenge
from Alice challenging him

810
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:27,416 A:middle
to beat her score of 40 seconds.

811
00:35:28,576 --> 00:35:33,226 A:middle
So that's great and that's
how Challenges work currently.

812
00:35:34,056 --> 00:35:36,126 A:middle
But let's say that
Tom happened to earn

813
00:35:36,126 --> 00:35:39,826 A:middle
that lap time using a beat-up
old pickup truck per se.

814
00:35:40,316 --> 00:35:43,536 A:middle
So it might be hard to actually
get 50 seconds as a lap time

815
00:35:43,536 --> 00:35:46,316 A:middle
with a beat-up old
pickup truck and much,

816
00:35:46,316 --> 00:35:48,276 A:middle
much harder than doing it
with, say, a super car.

817
00:35:49,086 --> 00:35:52,006 A:middle
So how can we make it such that
when Alice gets that challenge

818
00:35:52,006 --> 00:35:55,836 A:middle
from Tom that she can only
complete that challenge as long

819
00:35:55,836 --> 00:36:00,076 A:middle
as she's earned that score
with the same gameplay context

820
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

821
00:36:00,076 --> 00:36:01,516 A:middle
that Tom used to earn his score?

822
00:36:02,676 --> 00:36:04,246 A:middle
Well, that's what a new feature,

823
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:06,476 A:middle
Modal Challenges,
allows you to do.

824
00:36:07,336 --> 00:36:09,696 A:middle
Now, Modal Challenges, what
they allow you to do is

825
00:36:09,696 --> 00:36:11,956 A:middle
when you're reporting scores
and reporting achievements

826
00:36:11,956 --> 00:36:14,586 A:middle
to Game Center, you can
optionally provide us

827
00:36:14,586 --> 00:36:17,656 A:middle
with a list of challenges
that you wish the server

828
00:36:17,656 --> 00:36:19,096 A:middle
to consider for completion.

829
00:36:19,986 --> 00:36:21,956 A:middle
And this entails some new API.

830
00:36:22,756 --> 00:36:27,026 A:middle
Report Scores and Report
Achievements now have extra

831
00:36:27,026 --> 00:36:29,536 A:middle
methods for Report Scores
with Eligible Challenges

832
00:36:29,536 --> 00:36:31,756 A:middle
with Completion Handler
and Report Achievements

833
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:34,006 A:middle
with Eligible Challenges
with Completion Handler.

834
00:36:34,896 --> 00:36:37,806 A:middle
This API doesn't replace
the current Report Scores

835
00:36:37,806 --> 00:36:39,716 A:middle
and Report Achievements
API that you know.

836
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:43,356 A:middle
It's really just an augmented
version in case you wish

837
00:36:43,356 --> 00:36:45,796 A:middle
to make use of Modal
Challenges within your game.

838
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:48,826 A:middle
So let's take a look
at how we can make sure

839
00:36:48,826 --> 00:36:52,636 A:middle
that when Alice is earning
her lap time around this track

840
00:36:52,636 --> 00:36:55,026 A:middle
in your game that she
only completes challenges

841
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:58,946 A:middle
that were earned for
that exact same car

842
00:36:58,946 --> 00:37:00,436 A:middle
that Alice has raced
around with.

843
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

844
00:37:00,536 --> 00:37:03,946 A:middle
So at the end of Alice's
play through, right,

845
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:07,246 A:middle
first thing that you could do
is load the Received Challenges

846
00:37:07,486 --> 00:37:08,916 A:middle
that Alice got from her friends,

847
00:37:09,516 --> 00:37:11,146 A:middle
and that completion
handler is called back.

848
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:13,916 A:middle
You could filter through
any of the score challenges

849
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:16,396 A:middle
because we only really care
about lap times in this case.

850
00:37:17,146 --> 00:37:19,716 A:middle
For every score challenge
that Alice has received

851
00:37:19,716 --> 00:37:23,426 A:middle
from her friend, there
is a context property.

852
00:37:24,456 --> 00:37:27,696 A:middle
Now this is something that has
existed forever in Game Center.

853
00:37:28,016 --> 00:37:31,686 A:middle
Every score has a UN64
property called context

854
00:37:31,906 --> 00:37:34,806 A:middle
that you can add any value
that you wish to the score.

855
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:37,766 A:middle
And when you either submit
it to a leaderboard or attach

856
00:37:37,766 --> 00:37:40,056 A:middle
to a challenge, that context
is going to be attached

857
00:37:40,056 --> 00:37:42,046 A:middle
to that score on the other end.

858
00:37:42,266 --> 00:37:46,506 A:middle
So you could embed the car
model that Tom happened to race

859
00:37:46,506 --> 00:37:48,896 A:middle
around the track with on
that score that he used

860
00:37:48,896 --> 00:37:49,736 A:middle
to create the challenge.

861
00:37:50,306 --> 00:37:51,786 A:middle
And then on Alice's device,

862
00:37:52,016 --> 00:37:54,286 A:middle
you can pull the car
model out of that score.

863
00:37:55,676 --> 00:37:57,846 A:middle
All you need to do is check
to see whether the car model

864
00:37:57,846 --> 00:37:58,916 A:middle
for that challenge happens

865
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:01,236 A:middle
to match the car
model Alice just used

866
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

867
00:38:01,236 --> 00:38:02,156 A:middle
to race around the track.

868
00:38:03,046 --> 00:38:04,836 A:middle
And if it does match,
you can add it

869
00:38:04,836 --> 00:38:06,696 A:middle
to these challenges
with same car array.

870
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:08,746 A:middle
Really, just a list
of challenges you wish

871
00:38:08,746 --> 00:38:11,076 A:middle
to be considered by the Game
Center servers for completion.

872
00:38:12,656 --> 00:38:16,556 A:middle
And finally, you're going to use
the new API for Report Scores.

873
00:38:17,416 --> 00:38:20,316 A:middle
You're going to pass the
score that Alice just earned

874
00:38:20,316 --> 00:38:23,886 A:middle
in her play through session
and you're going to pass a list

875
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:26,896 A:middle
of the challenges that
were created with scores

876
00:38:27,146 --> 00:38:28,686 A:middle
with the exact same care

877
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:31,436 A:middle
that Alice just raced
around the track end.

878
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:33,086 A:middle
And then the optional
completion handler.

879
00:38:33,616 --> 00:38:35,186 A:middle
And that's it.

880
00:38:35,366 --> 00:38:37,626 A:middle
That's how Modal
Challenges work.

881
00:38:38,056 --> 00:38:40,916 A:middle
As well as making sure
that only challenges

882
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:43,056 A:middle
that makes sense can be
completed within your game,

883
00:38:43,326 --> 00:38:45,116 A:middle
this also allows
you to do things

884
00:38:45,116 --> 00:38:47,696 A:middle
like challenge-specific modes
within your game so that

885
00:38:47,696 --> 00:38:50,166 A:middle
when a player launches
your game because they wish

886
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:52,466 A:middle
to play a single
challenge, you could set them

887
00:38:52,466 --> 00:38:56,456 A:middle
up an entirely new gameplay mode
so that when they are in a score

888
00:38:56,456 --> 00:38:58,706 A:middle
in that mode, only that
one challenge is completed.

889
00:38:59,426 --> 00:39:00,806 A:middle
Really, it's all up to you.

890
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

891
00:39:02,796 --> 00:39:05,276 A:middle
A new feature that we
have for Challenges

892
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:08,526 A:middle
as well regards programmatically
issuing challenges

893
00:39:08,526 --> 00:39:09,966 A:middle
within your game.

894
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:14,126 A:middle
Now, we allowed you to
programmatically send Challenges

895
00:39:14,126 --> 00:39:17,636 A:middle
to players within your game when
we released Challenges in iOS 6

896
00:39:17,826 --> 00:39:18,946 A:middle
and OS X Mountain Lion.

897
00:39:19,796 --> 00:39:22,496 A:middle
And we further augmented
this with iOS 7.

898
00:39:23,606 --> 00:39:25,416 A:middle
So let's say that your
player just happened

899
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:28,686 A:middle
to complete a level and they
earned a score of 500 points

900
00:39:28,686 --> 00:39:30,126 A:middle
and maybe they even
earned an achievement,

901
00:39:30,626 --> 00:39:33,526 A:middle
right now will be a great
time to allow your players

902
00:39:33,526 --> 00:39:35,136 A:middle
to send a challenge
to their friends.

903
00:39:35,866 --> 00:39:37,926 A:middle
You don't want them to have to
exit your game in order to go

904
00:39:37,926 --> 00:39:40,446 A:middle
into the Game Center app to
do this, it's better for them

905
00:39:40,446 --> 00:39:42,236 A:middle
to just do it right here
so that they can get

906
00:39:42,236 --> 00:39:44,696 A:middle
on with playing your game.

907
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:48,856 A:middle
Now again, last year, with
iOS 6 and OS X Mountain Lion,

908
00:39:49,076 --> 00:39:50,376 A:middle
we allowed you to do this.

909
00:39:50,686 --> 00:39:53,776 A:middle
We're making it even easier
this year by providing you

910
00:39:53,776 --> 00:39:57,466 A:middle
with a friend picker and compose
controller that we create

911
00:39:57,466 --> 00:39:59,306 A:middle
on your behalf and
present to the player,

912
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

913
00:40:00,116 --> 00:40:01,746 A:middle
where they get a list
of their friends,

914
00:40:01,826 --> 00:40:03,286 A:middle
and if it's an achievement
challenge

915
00:40:03,286 --> 00:40:05,386 A:middle
which friends have earned
this achievement or eligible

916
00:40:05,386 --> 00:40:09,096 A:middle
to receive this challenge, the
player can then select friends,

917
00:40:09,426 --> 00:40:12,086 A:middle
one or many, that they wish
to send this challenge to,

918
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:15,946 A:middle
pressing the Next button, up
comes a composed controller

919
00:40:16,276 --> 00:40:18,186 A:middle
with a preformatted
default message

920
00:40:18,186 --> 00:40:21,756 A:middle
that you can optionally pass
to us that they can edit,

921
00:40:21,756 --> 00:40:23,986 A:middle
and then they can choose to send
that challenge to their friends.

922
00:40:25,476 --> 00:40:29,906 A:middle
Using this composed
controller flow is very,

923
00:40:29,906 --> 00:40:31,286 A:middle
very straightforward.

924
00:40:31,286 --> 00:40:33,196 A:middle
And let's take a look
at how we can do this

925
00:40:33,196 --> 00:40:34,516 A:middle
with achievement challenges.

926
00:40:35,756 --> 00:40:36,856 A:middle
The first thing that
you're going

927
00:40:36,856 --> 00:40:40,856 A:middle
to do is allocate your GK
achievement object just

928
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:42,736 A:middle
like you would in any
achievement challenge

929
00:40:42,736 --> 00:40:44,736 A:middle
that you wish to issue
programmatically previously.

930
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:48,096 A:middle
You set up the achievement,
setting the identifier

931
00:40:48,096 --> 00:40:50,386 A:middle
with the appropriate
identifier on iTunes Connect.

932
00:40:51,206 --> 00:40:52,756 A:middle
And you make sure that you set

933
00:40:52,756 --> 00:40:54,816 A:middle
that percent complete
value to 100 percent.

934
00:40:55,366 --> 00:40:56,796 A:middle
You can only challenge friends

935
00:40:56,796 --> 00:41:00,096 A:middle
to 100 percent complete
achievement, not part way.

936
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

937
00:41:00,676 --> 00:41:04,586 A:middle
And then, to get this
UIViewController

938
00:41:04,726 --> 00:41:06,596 A:middle
that represents the
composed sequence,

939
00:41:07,456 --> 00:41:08,786 A:middle
you're going to call a new API.

940
00:41:09,826 --> 00:41:13,716 A:middle
And it's available on both
GK achievement and GK score,

941
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,196 A:middle
and it's this method here.

942
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:18,486 A:middle
Its challenge composed
controller with players

943
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:21,276 A:middle
where you can pass in an
optional list of friends

944
00:41:21,276 --> 00:41:23,466 A:middle
of the local player that
you wish to be preselected.

945
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,956 A:middle
Then a message which is
an optional NSString

946
00:41:26,956 --> 00:41:29,796 A:middle
that you can pass that will pop
up in the composed controller

947
00:41:29,986 --> 00:41:32,066 A:middle
as the default message
that players can then edit.

948
00:41:32,066 --> 00:41:34,056 A:middle
And then the completion handler.

949
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,796 A:middle
And when the completion
handler is called back,

950
00:41:36,886 --> 00:41:38,496 A:middle
that means that the
player happen

951
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,356 A:middle
to either send the
challenge to their friends

952
00:41:40,886 --> 00:41:42,706 A:middle
or cancel sending the challenge.

953
00:41:43,026 --> 00:41:45,396 A:middle
And at this point, you need
to dismiss the view controller

954
00:41:45,396 --> 00:41:48,286 A:middle
and then do whatever
post processing you wish

955
00:41:48,496 --> 00:41:50,326 A:middle
because we also tell you
whether the player happened

956
00:41:50,326 --> 00:41:54,006 A:middle
to really issue that challenge,
and if they did, which friends

957
00:41:54,006 --> 00:41:55,946 A:middle
and player IDs they
sent that challenge to.

958
00:41:56,496 --> 00:41:59,586 A:middle
And then finally, once
you've gotten this incense

959
00:41:59,586 --> 00:42:02,246 A:middle
of the UIViewController,
you just need to present it

960
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

961
00:42:02,246 --> 00:42:04,806 A:middle
like you would any other UI
view controller within your app.

962
00:42:06,216 --> 00:42:07,156 A:middle
And that's it.

963
00:42:07,156 --> 00:42:08,776 A:middle
That's how you do
programmatic issuing

964
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,036 A:middle
of challenges with iOS 7.

965
00:42:11,316 --> 00:42:14,386 A:middle
We think it makes it even
easier in order to allow players

966
00:42:14,386 --> 00:42:15,686 A:middle
to send challenges
to each other.

967
00:42:16,966 --> 00:42:19,346 A:middle
So you may be familiar already

968
00:42:19,606 --> 00:42:22,526 A:middle
with our existing
Issue Challenge

969
00:42:22,526 --> 00:42:23,656 A:middle
to Players Message method.

970
00:42:24,496 --> 00:42:26,646 A:middle
And since we've really
streamlined the way

971
00:42:27,016 --> 00:42:30,766 A:middle
that you can send challenges to
friends of your local player,

972
00:42:31,046 --> 00:42:32,816 A:middle
we're deciding to
deprecate this method.

973
00:42:33,516 --> 00:42:35,026 A:middle
And instead, we urge you to move

974
00:42:35,026 --> 00:42:37,196 A:middle
on to using the Challenge
Composed Controller

975
00:42:37,196 --> 00:42:41,236 A:middle
with Players Message
Completion Handler, the new API.

976
00:42:41,446 --> 00:42:45,116 A:middle
Now, in case your game is
running on an iOS 7 device

977
00:42:45,116 --> 00:42:48,826 A:middle
and is still using this legacy
API, they'll still work,

978
00:42:49,246 --> 00:42:51,696 A:middle
but we're going to present
a composed controller

979
00:42:51,696 --> 00:42:54,866 A:middle
and friend picker to the player
on your behalf automatically.

980
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:58,386 A:middle
And this is great, but
I definitely urge you

981
00:42:58,386 --> 00:43:00,006 A:middle
to consider moving
over to the new API

982
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

983
00:43:00,216 --> 00:43:02,826 A:middle
because if you were
programmatically sending

984
00:43:02,826 --> 00:43:05,196 A:middle
challenges in the middle of
a gameplay session per se,

985
00:43:05,556 --> 00:43:08,096 A:middle
you definitely don't want
a view controller to pop

986
00:43:08,096 --> 00:43:11,516 A:middle
up in the middle of a player
jumping over a very wide pit.

987
00:43:11,696 --> 00:43:13,916 A:middle
So you know when
the timing is best

988
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:15,066 A:middle
to actually present this UI.

989
00:43:15,796 --> 00:43:18,466 A:middle
So definitely move on to
the new API that we have.

990
00:43:20,356 --> 00:43:22,206 A:middle
So that's what's
new in Challenges.

991
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:25,056 A:middle
We've got modal challenges
for selective completion

992
00:43:25,086 --> 00:43:27,106 A:middle
of challenges within
your game based

993
00:43:27,106 --> 00:43:28,506 A:middle
on context that you define.

994
00:43:29,426 --> 00:43:33,186 A:middle
We've got brand new programmatic
issuing of challenges API

995
00:43:33,276 --> 00:43:35,726 A:middle
to make it even easier to
send challenges to friends

996
00:43:35,756 --> 00:43:36,926 A:middle
with a local player
in your game.

997
00:43:37,996 --> 00:43:40,676 A:middle
And we've also-- because
of this streamlined API,

998
00:43:40,746 --> 00:43:42,826 A:middle
we've deprecated the
issue challenge API.

999
00:43:42,826 --> 00:43:46,036 A:middle
And if your game still happens
to use it when it's running

1000
00:43:46,036 --> 00:43:49,566 A:middle
on iOS 7, it's still going
to work, but the new UI,

1001
00:43:49,566 --> 00:43:51,776 A:middle
that new view controller,
is automatically going

1002
00:43:51,776 --> 00:43:53,136 A:middle
to be presented to
the local player.

1003
00:43:54,626 --> 00:43:57,176 A:middle
So that's Challenges,
that's what's new

1004
00:43:57,276 --> 00:43:58,616 A:middle
in Game Center for Challenges.

1005
00:43:58,616 --> 00:44:00,766 A:middle
Let's move on to the next
big topic of the day--

1006
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1007
00:44:01,276 --> 00:44:03,526 A:middle
handling events relevant
to the local player.

1008
00:44:04,116 --> 00:44:07,006 A:middle
Now you may be familiar
with handling events

1009
00:44:07,006 --> 00:44:09,806 A:middle
for the local player in the
Game Kit Framework today.

1010
00:44:10,186 --> 00:44:12,856 A:middle
We have a lot of different
singleton objects that you had

1011
00:44:12,856 --> 00:44:14,126 A:middle
to declare delegates for.

1012
00:44:14,386 --> 00:44:18,146 A:middle
If you want to hook into when
the local player completed the

1013
00:44:18,146 --> 00:44:20,136 A:middle
challenge, we have the GK
Challenge Event Handler

1014
00:44:20,136 --> 00:44:23,216 A:middle
Singleton and we had the GK
Challenge Event Handler Delegate

1015
00:44:23,266 --> 00:44:26,496 A:middle
Protocol that you would set as a
delegate for that event handler.

1016
00:44:26,826 --> 00:44:28,526 A:middle
We also had things
for turn-based match--

1017
00:44:28,676 --> 00:44:31,756 A:middle
or for a turn-based gameplay,
they had a singleton object,

1018
00:44:31,806 --> 00:44:34,226 A:middle
and the GK Matchmaker
had an invite property.

1019
00:44:35,176 --> 00:44:39,186 A:middle
Well, we've thoroughly revamped
the way and redefined the way

1020
00:44:39,186 --> 00:44:42,266 A:middle
in iOS 7 that you can
handle events relevant

1021
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:43,146 A:middle
to the local player.

1022
00:44:44,096 --> 00:44:45,486 A:middle
And we're doing it like this.

1023
00:44:46,386 --> 00:44:49,786 A:middle
You can think of the GK Local
Player instance as the source

1024
00:44:49,786 --> 00:44:52,516 A:middle
of all the events that are
relevant to your local player.

1025
00:44:53,446 --> 00:44:55,966 A:middle
And so, whether the players
received the challenge,

1026
00:44:55,966 --> 00:44:58,306 A:middle
completed the challenge,
gotten a new turn,

1027
00:44:58,306 --> 00:45:01,046 A:middle
maybe a turn-based invite
or some matchmaking invite,

1028
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1029
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,706 A:middle
that's going to be channeled
through the local player.

1030
00:45:03,706 --> 00:45:08,006 A:middle
And the local player can have
multiple listeners registered

1031
00:45:08,036 --> 00:45:08,346 A:middle
to it.

1032
00:45:09,296 --> 00:45:11,916 A:middle
And when a local player
listener is registered

1033
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:14,536 A:middle
on the local player and a
message happens to come in,

1034
00:45:14,536 --> 00:45:17,866 A:middle
an event is triggered, that
listener or any listener

1035
00:45:17,866 --> 00:45:21,926 A:middle
that is compatible for that
callback is going to get called.

1036
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:25,256 A:middle
Your listener object when you
register on a local player,

1037
00:45:25,486 --> 00:45:28,626 A:middle
it needs to conform to the GK
Local Player Listener Protocol.

1038
00:45:29,356 --> 00:45:33,796 A:middle
And this protocol, in turn,
conforms to three sub-protocols,

1039
00:45:34,516 --> 00:45:36,156 A:middle
all defining optional methods.

1040
00:45:36,156 --> 00:45:38,596 A:middle
None of the methods in these
protocols are required,

1041
00:45:38,596 --> 00:45:39,686 A:middle
so you can pick and choose.

1042
00:45:39,726 --> 00:45:42,536 A:middle
First is the GK Challenge
Listener Subprotocol

1043
00:45:42,816 --> 00:45:44,656 A:middle
that defines the
various callbacks

1044
00:45:44,656 --> 00:45:45,896 A:middle
that you can optionally conform

1045
00:45:45,896 --> 00:45:49,116 A:middle
to when the player has completed
a challenge or had some sort

1046
00:45:49,116 --> 00:45:51,156 A:middle
of challenge relevant
event occur.

1047
00:45:51,836 --> 00:45:54,136 A:middle
We've also got GK
Turn-Based Event Listener

1048
00:45:54,426 --> 00:45:56,616 A:middle
for turn-based gaming
specific callbacks

1049
00:45:56,956 --> 00:46:00,476 A:middle
and GK Invite Event
Listener for GK Matchmaking,

1050
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1051
00:46:00,696 --> 00:46:02,426 A:middle
real-time matchmaking callbacks.

1052
00:46:02,876 --> 00:46:06,646 A:middle
Once you've created your
listener, in order to register,

1053
00:46:06,646 --> 00:46:07,836 A:middle
it's very straightforward.

1054
00:46:08,596 --> 00:46:10,696 A:middle
I'm going to adopt one of
these subprotocols or any

1055
00:46:10,696 --> 00:46:13,356 A:middle
of those methods and those
subprotocols, and you're going

1056
00:46:13,356 --> 00:46:16,176 A:middle
to call on the Local Player
Instance Register Listener

1057
00:46:16,436 --> 00:46:19,406 A:middle
passing this listener
instance that you've set up.

1058
00:46:20,206 --> 00:46:23,456 A:middle
And you can pass-- you can
register multiple listeners.

1059
00:46:24,636 --> 00:46:26,746 A:middle
And you also don't need
to worry about the timing

1060
00:46:26,846 --> 00:46:28,396 A:middle
that you're registering
these listeners.

1061
00:46:28,796 --> 00:46:31,706 A:middle
You may be familiar that
previously we asked you

1062
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:35,756 A:middle
to register or set delegates
on turn-based event handlers,

1063
00:46:35,756 --> 00:46:37,886 A:middle
challenge event handlers,
all those other singletons

1064
00:46:38,276 --> 00:46:40,596 A:middle
in the authentication
handler callback.

1065
00:46:41,276 --> 00:46:43,176 A:middle
Well, you don't need to
worry about that anymore.

1066
00:46:43,386 --> 00:46:46,616 A:middle
In case your-- the local player
happened to receive some sort

1067
00:46:46,616 --> 00:46:49,536 A:middle
of event and there is
no listener registered

1068
00:46:49,536 --> 00:46:51,636 A:middle
for the local player at
that time that could handle

1069
00:46:51,636 --> 00:46:54,246 A:middle
that event, the local player
is going to cache that event.

1070
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:57,406 A:middle
So when you register
listener at some time later,

1071
00:46:57,936 --> 00:47:01,156 A:middle
it'll have that event to
dispatch to your listener or all

1072
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1073
00:47:01,156 --> 00:47:06,326 A:middle
of the listeners that are
capable of handling that event.

1074
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:09,376 A:middle
So since we've talked a
bit about challenges today,

1075
00:47:09,616 --> 00:47:11,186 A:middle
how about we take a look
at the group of methods

1076
00:47:11,186 --> 00:47:13,776 A:middle
that you can implement
optionally within your listener

1077
00:47:14,016 --> 00:47:16,386 A:middle
in order to hook into
challenge relevant gameplay?

1078
00:47:17,676 --> 00:47:21,156 A:middle
The GK Challenge Listener
Subprotocol defines four

1079
00:47:21,156 --> 00:47:25,086 A:middle
different methods that you can
optionally implement in order

1080
00:47:25,086 --> 00:47:27,526 A:middle
to hook into challenge-specific
events concerning the

1081
00:47:27,526 --> 00:47:28,186 A:middle
local player.

1082
00:47:28,956 --> 00:47:31,556 A:middle
Let's take a quick look
through these different methods,

1083
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,846 A:middle
what they mean, and
how you can use them

1084
00:47:34,046 --> 00:47:37,026 A:middle
within your listener
object or objects in order

1085
00:47:37,096 --> 00:47:40,336 A:middle
to enable custom challenge
based gameplay in your game.

1086
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:44,926 A:middle
The first is concerning
selecting challenges.

1087
00:47:44,996 --> 00:47:48,226 A:middle
That is, when a player
happens to receive a challenge

1088
00:47:48,226 --> 00:47:50,696 A:middle
from a friend, whether
they are playing your game

1089
00:47:50,696 --> 00:47:54,576 A:middle
or they're hanging around
in the Game Center app,

1090
00:47:55,036 --> 00:47:58,876 A:middle
and they tap an iOS
notification center banner

1091
00:47:59,086 --> 00:48:01,796 A:middle
or they tap a play bubble
within the Game Center app,

1092
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1093
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:04,166 A:middle
or if they tap a play bubble

1094
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:06,036 A:middle
within the GK Game
Center view controller,

1095
00:48:06,506 --> 00:48:09,456 A:middle
we're going to call back to
your listener Player Wants

1096
00:48:09,456 --> 00:48:10,266 A:middle
to Play Challenge.

1097
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,146 A:middle
And really, what this means is

1098
00:48:12,146 --> 00:48:14,956 A:middle
that the player tapped this
challenge banner and they want

1099
00:48:14,956 --> 00:48:17,276 A:middle
to play your game in order
to complete that challenge.

1100
00:48:17,666 --> 00:48:20,406 A:middle
So at that point, if you've
got challenge-specific gameplay

1101
00:48:20,406 --> 00:48:24,356 A:middle
modes within your game, you
can call Self-Start Challenge

1102
00:48:24,356 --> 00:48:26,086 A:middle
for Challenge if you've
got a method like that,

1103
00:48:26,086 --> 00:48:27,646 A:middle
passing in the challenge to set

1104
00:48:27,646 --> 00:48:29,816 A:middle
up this gameplay
mode for challenges.

1105
00:48:31,176 --> 00:48:33,656 A:middle
Similar to selecting
challenges within your game,

1106
00:48:33,656 --> 00:48:36,076 A:middle
we also got receiving
challenges.

1107
00:48:36,646 --> 00:48:39,466 A:middle
This is an event that
is called back to your--

1108
00:48:39,466 --> 00:48:40,966 A:middle
on your local player listener

1109
00:48:41,606 --> 00:48:44,526 A:middle
when the player is playing your
game currently and they happen

1110
00:48:44,526 --> 00:48:45,906 A:middle
to receive a challenge
from a friend.

1111
00:48:46,596 --> 00:48:49,836 A:middle
At that time, player did receive
challenge is going to called

1112
00:48:49,836 --> 00:48:53,356 A:middle
on your listener and you may
wish to present some custom UI,

1113
00:48:53,356 --> 00:48:55,366 A:middle
like if Alice sent
Tom a challenge

1114
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:57,106 A:middle
to beat her track
score, you might want

1115
00:48:57,106 --> 00:49:00,116 A:middle
to show Alice's picture right
there with the challenge message

1116
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1117
00:49:00,116 --> 00:49:01,166 A:middle
that she happened to define.

1118
00:49:01,546 --> 00:49:03,196 A:middle
And you could do that
within this method.

1119
00:49:04,586 --> 00:49:08,066 A:middle
The last two methods in the GK
Challenge Listener Protocol are

1120
00:49:08,066 --> 00:49:09,966 A:middle
concerning completing
challenges.

1121
00:49:10,786 --> 00:49:13,516 A:middle
The first, when the local player
happened to complete a challenge

1122
00:49:13,516 --> 00:49:15,806 A:middle
that they receive from a friend,

1123
00:49:15,866 --> 00:49:18,826 A:middle
Player Did Complete Challenge
Issued by Friend is called

1124
00:49:18,826 --> 00:49:20,966 A:middle
when the local player completes
a challenge in your game.

1125
00:49:21,596 --> 00:49:24,026 A:middle
And at this point, you know,
if you want to congra--

1126
00:49:24,026 --> 00:49:26,356 A:middle
display a congrats banner to
the player or whatever UI,

1127
00:49:26,826 --> 00:49:29,366 A:middle
maybe even reward them
gameplay-wise within your game,

1128
00:49:29,516 --> 00:49:30,356 A:middle
you could do that here.

1129
00:49:30,856 --> 00:49:35,606 A:middle
And then, also, when the
local player's friend happened

1130
00:49:35,606 --> 00:49:38,676 A:middle
to have completed the challenge
that the local player sent then,

1131
00:49:39,506 --> 00:49:43,146 A:middle
that's where Player Issue
Challenge was Completed

1132
00:49:43,316 --> 00:49:45,656 A:middle
by Friend is going to be
called back on your listener.

1133
00:49:46,406 --> 00:49:48,246 A:middle
At this point, you might
want to inform the player

1134
00:49:48,246 --> 00:49:49,856 A:middle
that perhaps their friends
are a little bit better

1135
00:49:49,856 --> 00:49:53,126 A:middle
than they thought they were,
and again, do whatever you wish

1136
00:49:53,126 --> 00:49:55,466 A:middle
in your game that makes sense.

1137
00:49:56,136 --> 00:49:58,566 A:middle
So that's just how
challenges work

1138
00:49:58,566 --> 00:49:59,956 A:middle
with GK Local Player Listener.

1139
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1140
00:50:00,696 --> 00:50:02,546 A:middle
But we're also doing a lot

1141
00:50:02,546 --> 00:50:05,046 A:middle
of things concerning
turn-based gaming as well

1142
00:50:05,046 --> 00:50:06,706 A:middle
as real-time matchmaking.

1143
00:50:07,186 --> 00:50:09,926 A:middle
Those are all built with
the GK Local Player Listener

1144
00:50:10,576 --> 00:50:11,946 A:middle
architecture as well.

1145
00:50:12,796 --> 00:50:15,726 A:middle
And as you may guess, that
means that we are, in turn,

1146
00:50:15,956 --> 00:50:18,276 A:middle
deprecating the GK
Challenge Event Handler,

1147
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:22,136 A:middle
the GK Turn-Based Event Handler
Singleton and their delegates,

1148
00:50:22,136 --> 00:50:24,206 A:middle
as well as the Invite
Handler property

1149
00:50:24,466 --> 00:50:26,646 A:middle
of the GK Matchmaker object.

1150
00:50:27,806 --> 00:50:30,886 A:middle
And since this affects
multiplayer as well, tomorrow,

1151
00:50:30,886 --> 00:50:33,416 A:middle
Nathan's got a multiplayer
session,

1152
00:50:33,526 --> 00:50:35,836 A:middle
making multiplayer
games with Game Center,

1153
00:50:35,836 --> 00:50:37,876 A:middle
I definitely urge you to
check that out in order

1154
00:50:37,876 --> 00:50:41,196 A:middle
to learn how you can adopt GK
Local Player Listener Protocols,

1155
00:50:41,486 --> 00:50:43,596 A:middle
in order to use turn-based
gaming

1156
00:50:43,596 --> 00:50:45,546 A:middle
within your game
and GK Matchmaking.

1157
00:50:47,616 --> 00:50:51,366 A:middle
So we've learned a lot of
different things today.

1158
00:50:51,486 --> 00:50:54,476 A:middle
In addition to our brand new
UI that we've also got going

1159
00:50:54,476 --> 00:50:56,446 A:middle
on with the GK Game
Center view controller,

1160
00:50:56,846 --> 00:50:59,066 A:middle
we've increased the maximum
amount of leaderboards

1161
00:50:59,066 --> 00:51:02,046 A:middle
that you can use within your
game to 500 leaderboards.

1162
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1163
00:51:02,466 --> 00:51:04,446 A:middle
And you can impose a
hierarchical structure

1164
00:51:04,446 --> 00:51:07,696 A:middle
on these leaderboards with a new
feature called Leaderboard Sets.

1165
00:51:08,426 --> 00:51:10,726 A:middle
Most Recent Score Leaderboards,
in case you want to make it

1166
00:51:10,726 --> 00:51:14,006 A:middle
such that player scores on
a leaderboard can go both up

1167
00:51:14,006 --> 00:51:17,556 A:middle
and down, and completely
customize the way

1168
00:51:17,556 --> 00:51:19,516 A:middle
that you rank players
within a leaderboard

1169
00:51:19,516 --> 00:51:21,086 A:middle
for your game, we've
got those too.

1170
00:51:22,286 --> 00:51:25,236 A:middle
Security measures that
we're taking on your behalf

1171
00:51:25,236 --> 00:51:28,886 A:middle
and we're also allowing you to
take in order to help combat

1172
00:51:28,886 --> 00:51:31,046 A:middle
and limit cheating
within your game.

1173
00:51:32,926 --> 00:51:34,936 A:middle
Challenges, we've
got modal challenges,

1174
00:51:35,046 --> 00:51:36,916 A:middle
further augmenting
challenge-based gameplay,

1175
00:51:37,306 --> 00:51:39,866 A:middle
and making it even easier
for you to allow your friends

1176
00:51:39,866 --> 00:51:42,396 A:middle
to send-- or your
players to send challenges

1177
00:51:42,396 --> 00:51:43,726 A:middle
to their friends
within their game.

1178
00:51:44,736 --> 00:51:48,126 A:middle
And then finally, we have
totally redefined the way

1179
00:51:48,126 --> 00:51:49,926 A:middle
that you can handle
events with--

1180
00:51:49,926 --> 00:51:51,896 A:middle
concerning the GK Local Player--

1181
00:51:52,186 --> 00:51:53,976 A:middle
with the GK Local
Player Listener API.

1182
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:58,046 A:middle
So it's a ton of stuff that
we've got going on this year,

1183
00:51:58,076 --> 00:52:00,516 A:middle
and that means that you probably
have a lot of questions.

1184
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1185
00:52:01,046 --> 00:52:02,936 A:middle
So Allan Schaffer,
he's our Graphics

1186
00:52:02,936 --> 00:52:04,386 A:middle
and Game Technologies
Evangelist.

1187
00:52:04,386 --> 00:52:05,966 A:middle
You can reach him at
this address right here.

1188
00:52:05,966 --> 00:52:09,276 A:middle
Ask him if you've got any
questions after the conference.

1189
00:52:09,796 --> 00:52:12,456 A:middle
Also, we've got brand
new documentation updated

1190
00:52:12,456 --> 00:52:15,346 A:middle
for this year's Game Kit
Framework available at the URL

1191
00:52:15,346 --> 00:52:18,746 A:middle
in the screen, as well as
at developer.apple.com,

1192
00:52:18,746 --> 00:52:21,496 A:middle
we've got some sample code
exhibiting how you can make use

1193
00:52:21,496 --> 00:52:25,926 A:middle
of best practices in order to
adopt Game Center features,

1194
00:52:26,296 --> 00:52:29,456 A:middle
both new for this year
with iOS 7 and preexisting.

1195
00:52:29,786 --> 00:52:30,956 A:middle
So definitely check that out.

1196
00:52:31,686 --> 00:52:34,736 A:middle
As well as Apple developer
forms, definitely use those.

1197
00:52:35,016 --> 00:52:38,676 A:middle
So a couple of sessions, what's
new in iTunes Connect tomorrow,

1198
00:52:38,876 --> 00:52:40,806 A:middle
check that out if you want
to learn more about how

1199
00:52:40,806 --> 00:52:42,546 A:middle
to use game groups
for Leaderboard Sets,

1200
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,616 A:middle
this new auditing tool
to help limit cheating,

1201
00:52:44,996 --> 00:52:46,836 A:middle
turn-based gaming
with Game Center.

1202
00:52:47,436 --> 00:52:48,726 A:middle
So thank you so much everybody.

1203
00:52:49,026 --> 00:52:49,896 A:middle
Have a great WWDC.

1204
00:52:49,896 --> 00:52:51,446 A:middle
It's been a pleasure.

1205
00:52:51,446 --> 00:52:53,016 A:middle
[Applause]

1206
00:52:53,016 --> 00:53:02,436 A:middle
