>> Todd Fernandez: Good morning,
and welcome Session 300,

3
00:00:12,486 --> 00:00:13,556 A:middle
Managing Apple Devices.

4
00:00:14,096 --> 00:00:16,616 A:middle
I'm Todd Fernandez and
I'm very happy to be here

5
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:19,066 A:middle
with you this morning
representing not only my own

6
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:21,476 A:middle
engineering teams, but
a number of other teams

7
00:00:21,476 --> 00:00:23,366 A:middle
from across the company
who had been hard

8
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:25,556 A:middle
at work making some
exciting changes

9
00:00:25,556 --> 00:00:27,266 A:middle
in how Apple devices
can be managed

10
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,226 A:middle
in education and enterprise.

11
00:00:29,686 --> 00:00:31,206 A:middle
Look out, I just
said the E word.

12
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:37,896 A:middle
In days of yore, device
management was based

13
00:00:37,896 --> 00:00:39,316 A:middle
on the desktop PC model.

14
00:00:39,986 --> 00:00:42,356 A:middle
IT departments would receive
a shipment of computers,

15
00:00:43,006 --> 00:00:46,656 A:middle
they'd erase them, install
a corporate custom image

16
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:49,796 A:middle
containing whatever software
and policies and settings

17
00:00:49,796 --> 00:00:50,976 A:middle
that they felt were appropriate.

18
00:00:52,016 --> 00:00:54,326 A:middle
They distribute those computers
out to their end users.

19
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:57,036 A:middle
Periodically, IT
may update them.

20
00:00:58,276 --> 00:01:00,736 A:middle
This model worked reasonably
well for a long time,

21
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

22
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:04,426 A:middle
but times have changed
and we here

23
00:01:04,426 --> 00:01:06,236 A:middle
at Apple will modestly
take most of the credit.

24
00:01:07,236 --> 00:01:09,306 A:middle
Customers now have much
higher expectations.

25
00:01:09,716 --> 00:01:11,636 A:middle
They're no longer
satisfied with the static

26
00:01:11,636 --> 00:01:14,156 A:middle
and monolithic system imaging
methodologies of the past.

27
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:17,136 A:middle
They now expect from their
device management tools

28
00:01:17,476 --> 00:01:19,126 A:middle
that they are dynamic
and on demand

29
00:01:19,126 --> 00:01:21,296 A:middle
and provide over-the-air
device management capabilities.

30
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:24,426 A:middle
In short, devices
are now mobile.

31
00:01:24,576 --> 00:01:29,156 A:middle
iOS and the App Store introduced
the new model for deployment

32
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,696 A:middle
and management and we want
to complete that transition

33
00:01:31,696 --> 00:01:32,936 A:middle
for all Apple devices.

34
00:01:34,316 --> 00:01:36,416 A:middle
People are now buying their
own devices and wanting

35
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:38,496 A:middle
to bring them and use
them at school and work.

36
00:01:39,286 --> 00:01:41,486 A:middle
They're very comfortable
installing their own apps

37
00:01:41,556 --> 00:01:44,376 A:middle
and configuring those
devices to access resources

38
00:01:44,376 --> 00:01:46,526 A:middle
and information whether
they're on the road,

39
00:01:46,796 --> 00:01:49,106 A:middle
in the office, at
school or at home.

40
00:01:50,146 --> 00:01:52,396 A:middle
This has presented IT
departments with the challenge

41
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:53,886 A:middle
of supporting this multitude

42
00:01:53,886 --> 00:01:57,256 A:middle
of deployment models while
still providing easy setup,

43
00:01:57,926 --> 00:02:00,636 A:middle
enforcing security policies
and distributing apps

44
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

45
00:02:00,636 --> 00:02:02,376 A:middle
and other content out
to their end users.

46
00:02:03,316 --> 00:02:07,346 A:middle
Our goal is to enable those
organizations to manage all

47
00:02:07,346 --> 00:02:10,645 A:middle
of their Apple devices in the
same ways with the same tools.

48
00:02:11,596 --> 00:02:13,686 A:middle
We've been working towards
this goal for some time

49
00:02:13,736 --> 00:02:15,376 A:middle
and we're taking
a big step forward

50
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:17,896 A:middle
with some powerful new device
management capabilities

51
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:21,676 A:middle
that we've built in to both
iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks.

52
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:27,806 A:middle
People love how easy it is to
set up their new Mac, or iPad

53
00:02:27,806 --> 00:02:29,366 A:middle
or iPhone or iPod Touch.

54
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:32,136 A:middle
Within minutes, they are
connected to the internet,

55
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:34,296 A:middle
installing apps and
communicating

56
00:02:34,296 --> 00:02:35,356 A:middle
with their friends and family.

57
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:40,636 A:middle
And now, the same experience
is available to businesses

58
00:02:40,636 --> 00:02:44,156 A:middle
and schools to simplify
setup and management

59
00:02:44,156 --> 00:02:46,016 A:middle
of large numbers
of Apple devices.

60
00:02:48,016 --> 00:02:50,436 A:middle
We've greatly enhanced
app and book management,

61
00:02:50,956 --> 00:02:53,596 A:middle
dramatically simplified
device enrollment interval,

62
00:02:53,596 --> 00:02:57,876 A:middle
remote device management systems
and made a ton of enhancements

63
00:02:57,876 --> 00:03:01,036 A:middle
and added new capabilities
that enable organizations

64
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

65
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:05,026 A:middle
to get more control over their
devices while still preserving

66
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:07,966 A:middle
the great experience that users
have come to expect from Apple.

67
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:13,876 A:middle
So our agenda today, we'll begin
by covering the large number

68
00:03:13,876 --> 00:03:16,126 A:middle
of small to medium size
changes that we've made

69
00:03:16,126 --> 00:03:19,106 A:middle
to the MDM protocol and
configuration profiles

70
00:03:19,396 --> 00:03:22,026 A:middle
in both iOS and OS
X and I'll point

71
00:03:22,026 --> 00:03:24,366 A:middle
out the remaining OS
specific differences as we go.

72
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:28,096 A:middle
Now that work taken together
alone would be a huge advance,

73
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:29,286 A:middle
but we didn't stop there.

74
00:03:29,986 --> 00:03:31,946 A:middle
We've also made big changes

75
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:33,746 A:middle
to the App Store
Volume Purchase Program

76
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:35,986 A:middle
and we're introducing
a new service

77
00:03:36,046 --> 00:03:39,076 A:middle
that makes it much easier
to get devices enrolled

78
00:03:39,076 --> 00:03:42,466 A:middle
in the MDM server solution that
the organization is deploying.

79
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:46,556 A:middle
Now, this session is primarily
targeted at developers

80
00:03:46,556 --> 00:03:49,376 A:middle
that are creating MDM and other
device management solutions.

81
00:03:50,376 --> 00:03:53,486 A:middle
Because we've done a lot of
work already, but we really rely

82
00:03:53,486 --> 00:03:55,646 A:middle
on you just as with the 1500

83
00:03:55,646 --> 00:03:57,546 A:middle
and more APIs we've
introduced this week

84
00:03:58,346 --> 00:04:00,796 A:middle
to fully take advantage of these
new capabilities we're offering

85
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

86
00:04:00,796 --> 00:04:02,786 A:middle
to you to make the experience

87
00:04:02,786 --> 00:04:04,616 A:middle
of our joint customers
much greater.

88
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:07,246 A:middle
But of course it will
also be of interest

89
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:10,646 A:middle
to anyone who's managing large
numbers of Apple devices as well

90
00:04:10,646 --> 00:04:13,046 A:middle
as app developers who want
to make their app attractive

91
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:15,926 A:middle
to education and enterprise
customers who are buying

92
00:04:15,926 --> 00:04:17,935 A:middle
and deploying large
numbers of Apple devices

93
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:20,966 A:middle
and may very well be interested
in buying large numbers

94
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:22,256 A:middle
of copies of your apps.

95
00:04:22,786 --> 00:04:25,146 A:middle
Now, I'm no marketing executive,
but I think that might be

96
00:04:25,146 --> 00:04:26,646 A:middle
of interest to some of you.

97
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:29,316 A:middle
So let's get started.

98
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:33,236 A:middle
Before we get into what's new,

99
00:04:33,426 --> 00:04:35,866 A:middle
I wanted to just
give a brief recap

100
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:38,876 A:middle
about the foundational tools
that Apple provides to those

101
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:41,256 A:middle
of you who are building
device management tools

102
00:04:41,256 --> 00:04:42,406 A:middle
for the Apple ecosystem.

103
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,616 A:middle
The first of which is our MDM
protocol which you can implement

104
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,376 A:middle
to be able to over the air
communicate with Apple devices

105
00:04:49,996 --> 00:04:54,376 A:middle
and get information about that
device, be able to remotely lock

106
00:04:54,376 --> 00:04:57,716 A:middle
or wipe the device if it's
lost, to be able to install apps

107
00:04:57,776 --> 00:04:59,976 A:middle
over the air, as well

108
00:04:59,976 --> 00:05:01,806 A:middle
as installing configuration
profiles.

109
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

110
00:05:02,506 --> 00:05:05,036 A:middle
Now, configuration profiles were
the second foundational tool.

111
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:08,146 A:middle
And they are collections
of settings

112
00:05:08,626 --> 00:05:11,646 A:middle
that can configure things on a
device such as accounts, mail,

113
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:15,186 A:middle
context, calendars and so
on, in post restrictions

114
00:05:15,426 --> 00:05:18,586 A:middle
such as disabling the camera
if this device will be used

115
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:21,916 A:middle
in a particularly sensitive
location, to provide access

116
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,126 A:middle
to services like
networking and printers,

117
00:05:25,126 --> 00:05:28,366 A:middle
as well as to actually complete
MDM enrollment and establish

118
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:30,156 A:middle
that connection back
to the MDM server.

119
00:05:30,946 --> 00:05:33,226 A:middle
Now, for those of you who
may not have actually solved

120
00:05:33,226 --> 00:05:36,136 A:middle
that problem of getting devices
enrolled in your MDM solution,

121
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,276 A:middle
you may be thinking, "Well,

122
00:05:37,316 --> 00:05:38,776 A:middle
Todd isn't that a
chicken and egg problem?

123
00:05:38,776 --> 00:05:41,526 A:middle
You've got the MDM protocol
that you need to be established

124
00:05:41,526 --> 00:05:43,046 A:middle
to deliver the configuration
profile

125
00:05:43,046 --> 00:05:44,566 A:middle
which establishes
the MDM protocol?"

126
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:47,206 A:middle
But in fact, we'll
leave that egg

127
00:05:47,206 --> 00:05:48,306 A:middle
to hatch later in the session.

128
00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:52,016 A:middle
So, just to give
you a quick scope

129
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:56,026 A:middle
of what change we've introduced
in these new OS releases,

130
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:57,936 A:middle
I'm only going to
highlight a few of these

131
00:05:57,936 --> 00:05:59,086 A:middle
and talk about them in detail.

132
00:05:59,286 --> 00:06:01,736 A:middle
But this is a huge amount of
work and we're looking forward

133
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

134
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,386 A:middle
to you integrating
these new capabilities

135
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:06,756 A:middle
into your device
management solutions.

136
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:12,876 A:middle
And I'm going to talk in some
detail about five of them.

137
00:06:13,336 --> 00:06:16,776 A:middle
The first four are
primarily of interest

138
00:06:16,896 --> 00:06:18,196 A:middle
to enterprise deployments.

139
00:06:18,616 --> 00:06:21,626 A:middle
But I think the fifth one will
be compelling for both education

140
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:24,656 A:middle
and enterprise customers
that are installing Apple TVs

141
00:06:24,656 --> 00:06:26,726 A:middle
in their conference
and classrooms.

142
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:29,406 A:middle
But before I get
into the details,

143
00:06:29,706 --> 00:06:32,546 A:middle
I want to spend the moment
talking about a problem

144
00:06:32,546 --> 00:06:34,436 A:middle
that the mobile device
industry is facing.

145
00:06:34,516 --> 00:06:39,656 A:middle
And that is how to keep separate
the user's personal private data

146
00:06:40,456 --> 00:06:43,846 A:middle
and the company's secure data.

147
00:06:44,966 --> 00:06:48,166 A:middle
Now, some in the industry
seemed to have concluded

148
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,806 A:middle
that the answer is
dual personas.

149
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:52,246 A:middle
That the user should have

150
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,346 A:middle
to decide whether
they're using their device

151
00:06:54,606 --> 00:06:57,676 A:middle
as their personal device with
access to their own private data

152
00:06:58,406 --> 00:07:01,476 A:middle
or they're using it as their
company's device with access

153
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

154
00:07:01,476 --> 00:07:02,546 A:middle
to the corporate secure data.

155
00:07:03,896 --> 00:07:05,496 A:middle
We don't think this
is the right approach.

156
00:07:06,286 --> 00:07:08,496 A:middle
We think that place is the
burden on the employee to make

157
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:10,476 A:middle
that decision and
that's not how you--

158
00:07:10,716 --> 00:07:12,166 A:middle
people are using their devices.

159
00:07:13,126 --> 00:07:15,506 A:middle
We think the solution
needs to separate the data

160
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,736 A:middle
without creating
separate workspaces.

161
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:22,436 A:middle
And so, the features I'm going
to talk about now are part

162
00:07:22,436 --> 00:07:25,236 A:middle
of that solution and are focused

163
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:29,996 A:middle
on keeping the user's personal
data protected and private

164
00:07:29,996 --> 00:07:32,806 A:middle
and the corporate data
protected and secure.

165
00:07:33,406 --> 00:07:38,106 A:middle
So the first feature I want to
talk about is very much in part

166
00:07:38,106 --> 00:07:40,556 A:middle
of that solution and
it's Manage Apps on iOS.

167
00:07:41,356 --> 00:07:43,256 A:middle
Now, this is not a
new feature in iOS 7.

168
00:07:44,076 --> 00:07:47,326 A:middle
What you can do previously
is install apps via MDM

169
00:07:47,406 --> 00:07:51,036 A:middle
on an iOS device and because the
organization has installed those

170
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:53,436 A:middle
apps on that device, they
have additional rights

171
00:07:53,436 --> 00:07:56,136 A:middle
over those devices--
over those apps

172
00:07:56,296 --> 00:07:58,446 A:middle
and can therefore have
more control over the data

173
00:07:58,446 --> 00:08:00,556 A:middle
to prevent their secure
data leaking out in ways

174
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

175
00:08:00,556 --> 00:08:03,506 A:middle
that they don't want including
being able to delete that app

176
00:08:03,506 --> 00:08:05,856 A:middle
and its data and
prevent that apps data

177
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:07,176 A:middle
from being backed up to iCloud.

178
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:13,146 A:middle
In iOS 7, writing a number
of new capabilities including

179
00:08:13,146 --> 00:08:16,056 A:middle
on supervise devices, and
that little guy there is going

180
00:08:16,056 --> 00:08:18,126 A:middle
to indicate that
particular setting

181
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:21,006 A:middle
or capability is only available
on supervised iOS devices

182
00:08:21,156 --> 00:08:24,016 A:middle
through out this session,
that apps can be installed

183
00:08:24,016 --> 00:08:26,426 A:middle
without user interaction on
supervised devices [applause].

184
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:33,416 A:middle
I'm glad you like that
but there's way more.

185
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:37,366 A:middle
And it's also possible
to configure device--

186
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:40,296 A:middle
configure apps over the
air to provide the defaults

187
00:08:40,296 --> 00:08:42,086 A:middle
to change their behavior
once they're installed

188
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:42,846 A:middle
on the device [applause].

189
00:08:47,256 --> 00:08:48,256 A:middle
I agree, it's really cool.

190
00:08:48,856 --> 00:08:51,016 A:middle
But we also have
the opposite of that

191
00:08:51,016 --> 00:08:54,366 A:middle
where using the MDM protocol,
you can then pull data back

192
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:58,126 A:middle
from the app that has been
stored in the App Sandbox back

193
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,416 A:middle
to the MDM server to provide
to the organization [applause].

194
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

195
00:09:04,486 --> 00:09:07,236 A:middle
And then finally, this one
again is a big part of how--

196
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:10,666 A:middle
of keeping that data separate
is Managed Open In [applause].

197
00:09:14,996 --> 00:09:16,386 A:middle
Apparently, you all
know what that means.

198
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:19,996 A:middle
What that means is that the
organization can have greater

199
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:22,366 A:middle
control over how their
users open documents

200
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:23,976 A:middle
in Managed Apps and Accounts.

201
00:09:24,376 --> 00:09:26,786 A:middle
They can restrict the
list of apps that appear

202
00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:29,956 A:middle
in the Share Sheet thereby
keeping better control

203
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:31,896 A:middle
over that data and again,
preventing it from leaking

204
00:09:31,896 --> 00:09:34,066 A:middle
out in ways that
they don't want.

205
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:39,346 A:middle
The next feature I want to talk
about is called Single Sign On,

206
00:09:39,596 --> 00:09:41,056 A:middle
and this is really
building on some

207
00:09:41,056 --> 00:09:43,746 A:middle
of the concepts we introduced
in iOS 6 with the integration

208
00:09:43,746 --> 00:09:46,196 A:middle
of the Twitter and Facebook
credentials that are--

209
00:09:46,196 --> 00:09:47,576 A:middle
can be used in multiple apps.

210
00:09:47,936 --> 00:09:50,136 A:middle
We've now generalized
that to be able to be used

211
00:09:50,136 --> 00:09:53,336 A:middle
across the system where a set
of credentials can be stored

212
00:09:53,336 --> 00:09:55,666 A:middle
in one place provided
by configuration profile

213
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,696 A:middle
and then used by multiple
apps for authentication.

214
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

215
00:10:00,456 --> 00:10:02,726 A:middle
This, we think, will be
great for app developers

216
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:05,206 A:middle
to help them solve the
authentication problem

217
00:10:05,586 --> 00:10:07,596 A:middle
and help get their apps
adopted more wildly.

218
00:10:08,276 --> 00:10:10,466 A:middle
It takes the form
of a new payload

219
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:13,326 A:middle
that provides the credentials,
as well as optionally a set

220
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:17,386 A:middle
of URL prefixes where, if a
user goes to one of those URLs,

221
00:10:17,386 --> 00:10:19,646 A:middle
those credentials can be
used for authentication,

222
00:10:20,446 --> 00:10:22,836 A:middle
or in addition, they
can also provide a list

223
00:10:22,836 --> 00:10:25,436 A:middle
of app identifiers that are
for apps that are allowed

224
00:10:25,436 --> 00:10:27,286 A:middle
to use these credentials
for authentication.

225
00:10:27,646 --> 00:10:31,906 A:middle
Next, we move on to
one of the features

226
00:10:31,906 --> 00:10:33,446 A:middle
that Craig briefly
mentioned yesterday

227
00:10:33,446 --> 00:10:36,046 A:middle
and there's one brief shoutout
of excitement about that,

228
00:10:36,046 --> 00:10:38,036 A:middle
hopefully more of you are
excited about Per-App VPN

229
00:10:38,606 --> 00:10:40,716 A:middle
because this is another big
piece of the puzzle of how

230
00:10:40,716 --> 00:10:42,506 A:middle
to solve that data
separation problem.

231
00:10:43,796 --> 00:10:47,296 A:middle
Per-App VPN allows organizations
to more narrowly focus

232
00:10:47,686 --> 00:10:50,906 A:middle
which apps are going to use the
secure and private network back

233
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:53,236 A:middle
to their remote services
at their company.

234
00:10:54,276 --> 00:10:55,696 A:middle
What this means is that instead

235
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,826 A:middle
of having the VPN
cover the entire system

236
00:10:57,826 --> 00:11:00,216 A:middle
and have all data go
through that private network,

237
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

238
00:11:00,646 --> 00:11:02,416 A:middle
only the corporate
secure data will go

239
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,526 A:middle
through the secure network, the
users private data does not.

240
00:11:06,246 --> 00:11:09,086 A:middle
So, this is better for both the
organization and the end user.

241
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:11,656 A:middle
And there's one additional
detail for those of you

242
00:11:11,656 --> 00:11:15,396 A:middle
who are going to be implementing
this is that on iOS,

243
00:11:15,396 --> 00:11:17,466 A:middle
the Managed App needs
to be configured

244
00:11:17,466 --> 00:11:19,496 A:middle
to use Per-App VPN
when it's installed.

245
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:24,216 A:middle
If you didn't notice one
more detail about that,

246
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,386 A:middle
since it didn't have the iOS
badge up there when they cleared

247
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:29,436 A:middle
that Per-App VPN, is
available on both OS X and iOS.

248
00:11:30,686 --> 00:11:33,176 A:middle
Now, moving on to an
OS X specific feature,

249
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:35,206 A:middle
FileVault of course is not new

250
00:11:35,206 --> 00:11:37,246 A:middle
and even managing
FileVault is not new,

251
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:40,626 A:middle
but we've added a great
number of new capabilities

252
00:11:40,626 --> 00:11:44,436 A:middle
that you can now manage
remotely for OS X systems

253
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:47,566 A:middle
that are using FileVault,
including querying the status

254
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:50,716 A:middle
of whether FileVault is enabled,
as well as preventing users

255
00:11:50,716 --> 00:11:52,736 A:middle
from disabling FileVault
once it's been enabled.

256
00:11:53,186 --> 00:11:58,456 A:middle
During the process of
enabling FileVault,

257
00:11:58,456 --> 00:12:00,216 A:middle
an individual recovery
key is generated

258
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

259
00:12:00,216 --> 00:12:01,306 A:middle
and provided to the user.

260
00:12:02,206 --> 00:12:04,556 A:middle
Instead of that being
sent to Apple for help--

261
00:12:04,736 --> 00:12:08,096 A:middle
the AppleCare, organizations
can now configure the device

262
00:12:08,096 --> 00:12:11,286 A:middle
so that key is sent back to the
company instead of to Apple.

263
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,486 A:middle
They can also add
whatever period of--

264
00:12:14,486 --> 00:12:16,246 A:middle
periodicity they
feel is appropriate

265
00:12:16,246 --> 00:12:17,436 A:middle
for their security policies,

266
00:12:17,986 --> 00:12:22,736 A:middle
they can rotate the
institutional recovery key via

267
00:12:22,736 --> 00:12:22,826 A:middle
MDM [applause].

268
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:23,596 A:middle
Thank you.

269
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:28,606 A:middle
All right, we appreciate
your enthusiasm.

270
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:31,446 A:middle
All right, moving on
to AirPlay Mirroring.

271
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:33,466 A:middle
This is the feature that
I mentioned earlier.

272
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:35,026 A:middle
I think it will be
great for both education

273
00:12:35,026 --> 00:12:36,396 A:middle
and enterprise deployments.

274
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:41,286 A:middle
We are adding a new MDM command
that allows the MDM server

275
00:12:41,286 --> 00:12:43,876 A:middle
to tell a specific device
to begin AirPlay Mirroring

276
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:45,636 A:middle
to a specific AirPlay
destination.

277
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:48,516 A:middle
We're also providing
a new payload

278
00:12:48,516 --> 00:12:50,736 A:middle
that allows configuring
a whitelist

279
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:54,186 A:middle
of allowed destinations on
supervised devices as well

280
00:12:54,186 --> 00:12:57,206 A:middle
as pre-configuring passwords
for AirPlay destinations

281
00:12:57,556 --> 00:12:59,666 A:middle
in the payload so that users
don't have to answer them.

282
00:12:59,956 --> 00:13:03,726 A:middle
And you can have the Apple TVs
locked down but still not have

283
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

284
00:13:03,726 --> 00:13:06,256 A:middle
to have each end user
know what the password is.

285
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:10,346 A:middle
I'm also very pleased
to announce

286
00:13:10,516 --> 00:13:13,446 A:middle
that Apple TVs can now be
enrolled and managed via MDM.

287
00:13:18,126 --> 00:13:18,486 A:middle
[applause] We agree.

288
00:13:18,486 --> 00:13:20,466 A:middle
This is very exciting
including querying

289
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,896 A:middle
and setting the language
in locale

290
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:24,356 A:middle
and configuring our
network access including

291
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:26,446 A:middle
to protect the 802.1X networks.

292
00:13:26,946 --> 00:13:31,266 A:middle
But that's just the first couple
that I wanted to highlight,

293
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:34,576 A:middle
there's so much more including
the ability to install fonts

294
00:13:34,576 --> 00:13:37,246 A:middle
on both iOS and OS X via
configuration profile.

295
00:13:37,946 --> 00:13:40,316 A:middle
We've enhanced the Wi-Fi
payload to add support

296
00:13:40,316 --> 00:13:42,196 A:middle
for the new Wi-Fi Hotspot 2.0.

297
00:13:42,236 --> 00:13:47,076 A:middle
On iOS, we're allowing you to
configure AirPrint destinations.

298
00:13:47,766 --> 00:13:50,056 A:middle
All right, somebody's
using AirPrint?

299
00:13:51,316 --> 00:13:52,626 A:middle
Single App Mode is not new

300
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:55,396 A:middle
but you can now configure a
lot more accessibility options

301
00:13:55,396 --> 00:13:57,026 A:middle
which we think will
be great in schools

302
00:13:57,026 --> 00:13:59,226 A:middle
for doing testing
on iOS devices.

303
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

304
00:14:00,226 --> 00:14:01,646 A:middle
We're also providing
a new payload

305
00:14:01,646 --> 00:14:03,486 A:middle
that provides web
content filtering

306
00:14:03,486 --> 00:14:05,126 A:middle
on supervised iOS devices.

307
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:08,906 A:middle
And a few OS 10 specific
changes,

308
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:11,436 A:middle
the exchange web services
payload is not new

309
00:14:11,436 --> 00:14:14,496 A:middle
but it now supports all
five account types; Context,

310
00:14:14,496 --> 00:14:17,486 A:middle
Calendars, Email,
Notes and Reminders.

311
00:14:22,586 --> 00:14:24,476 A:middle
[applause] The passcode policy
of course is not new either,

312
00:14:24,476 --> 00:14:27,086 A:middle
it's been supported all
along on both iOS and OS X,

313
00:14:27,386 --> 00:14:30,566 A:middle
but there were a small number
of settings that did not--

314
00:14:30,656 --> 00:14:32,976 A:middle
were not supported
on OS X and we now

315
00:14:32,976 --> 00:14:36,186 A:middle
in OS X Mavericks have
complete parody with iOS,

316
00:14:36,286 --> 00:14:37,926 A:middle
so you're being confident

317
00:14:38,026 --> 00:14:41,526 A:middle
that your passcode policies
are applied the same way

318
00:14:41,526 --> 00:14:43,246 A:middle
across both OS's.

319
00:14:44,836 --> 00:14:47,566 A:middle
There are also, as you can
see, many new restrictions,

320
00:14:47,656 --> 00:14:49,486 A:middle
the first six there
available only

321
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:53,276 A:middle
on supervised devices including
preventing users from creating

322
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:54,636 A:middle
or modifying accounts.

323
00:14:54,946 --> 00:14:59,416 A:middle
Again, another way to
help separate the data

324
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:02,146 A:middle
between the users personal data
and the corporate secure data.

325
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

326
00:15:03,346 --> 00:15:06,346 A:middle
There's also a new restriction
controlling whether a supervised

327
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:10,166 A:middle
devices can pair to other
Macs but I'm going to talk

328
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,446 A:middle
about that more a bit
later in the session.

329
00:15:14,786 --> 00:15:16,416 A:middle
Finally, there are a number

330
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,286 A:middle
of additional enhancements
to the MDM protocol.

331
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:21,696 A:middle
I already mentioned one new
command, but there are a number

332
00:15:21,696 --> 00:15:25,636 A:middle
of new queries where you can
ask the device whether certain

333
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:27,936 A:middle
features are enabled
or not; Mobile HotSpot,

334
00:15:27,936 --> 00:15:29,456 A:middle
Do Not Disturb, Find My iPhone.

335
00:15:29,906 --> 00:15:31,106 A:middle
And you can also ask the device

336
00:15:31,106 --> 00:15:33,346 A:middle
if it has an iTunes
account signed in.

337
00:15:34,156 --> 00:15:37,916 A:middle
In addition to the new command
to begin AirPlay Mirroring

338
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:41,396 A:middle
to a destination, you can also
now set a custom lock screen

339
00:15:41,396 --> 00:15:41,646 A:middle
via MDM.

340
00:15:42,156 --> 00:15:43,686 A:middle
You can put the device
in lost mode

341
00:15:43,686 --> 00:15:46,076 A:middle
which adds contact
information to the lock screen,

342
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:47,836 A:middle
so that if somebody
finds your lost device,

343
00:15:47,836 --> 00:15:48,776 A:middle
they can get it back to you.

344
00:15:49,336 --> 00:15:52,306 A:middle
And you can also disable
the Personal Hotspot.

345
00:15:52,846 --> 00:15:58,206 A:middle
So, that's a lot of work and
lot of talking by me and I now

346
00:15:58,206 --> 00:15:59,816 A:middle
like to ask Jussi
and Chris to come up

347
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

348
00:16:00,136 --> 00:16:02,306 A:middle
and show off those new managed
app enhancements that you were

349
00:16:02,306 --> 00:16:04,056 A:middle
so excited about and
they are really cool.

350
00:16:04,106 --> 00:16:04,936 A:middle
So, guys take it away.

351
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:10,636 A:middle
[ Applause ]

352
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,236 A:middle
>> Jussi: All right,
thank you Todd.

353
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:13,906 A:middle
So, first I'm going
to show you some

354
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,876 A:middle
of the new management
features for Managed Apps.

355
00:16:16,246 --> 00:16:18,486 A:middle
So, Todd mentioned
managed configuration

356
00:16:18,486 --> 00:16:21,286 A:middle
and managed feedback for
managed applications.

357
00:16:21,286 --> 00:16:24,706 A:middle
So, here I have a sample
application that seems

358
00:16:24,706 --> 00:16:26,876 A:middle
to be stuck in time
back in 1993.

359
00:16:26,876 --> 00:16:28,816 A:middle
If anybody remember or
saw San Jose Conferences,

360
00:16:29,036 --> 00:16:30,866 A:middle
can you raise your hand?

361
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,226 A:middle
[applause] Oh, thank
you for coming back

362
00:16:32,226 --> 00:16:33,056 A:middle
and sticking with the platform.

363
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:35,136 A:middle
So, this used to be Newton
App, if you remember,

364
00:16:35,136 --> 00:16:38,756 A:middle
and we can update it to some
modern conference location.

365
00:16:38,756 --> 00:16:41,076 A:middle
So, if Chris is now
sending an app update,

366
00:16:41,076 --> 00:16:43,656 A:middle
so you notice right now
we're in San Francisco,

367
00:16:43,656 --> 00:16:44,896 A:middle
we just came back to the future.

368
00:16:45,196 --> 00:16:46,276 A:middle
And what just happened is

369
00:16:46,276 --> 00:16:49,096 A:middle
that there was an application
configuration payload

370
00:16:49,536 --> 00:16:53,586 A:middle
that was sent over MDM, so this
app got an instantaneous update

371
00:16:53,586 --> 00:16:57,036 A:middle
of a Push Notification and
as an application developer,

372
00:16:57,306 --> 00:17:00,006 A:middle
you want to think of what
kind of settings would you

373
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

374
00:17:00,006 --> 00:17:01,686 A:middle
like to implement
as live updates?

375
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:04,016 A:middle
This is effectively
life preferences

376
00:17:04,016 --> 00:17:05,026 A:middle
for some app settings.

377
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:07,906 A:middle
And as an MDM vendor, you'd
want to implement the method

378
00:17:07,906 --> 00:17:10,496 A:middle
for sending these
application-specific payloads--

379
00:17:10,536 --> 00:17:12,526 A:middle
configuration payloads
that they're not--

380
00:17:12,526 --> 00:17:14,376 A:middle
the developer has
taken advantage of.

381
00:17:14,965 --> 00:17:16,886 A:middle
So, that's all fine and great

382
00:17:16,886 --> 00:17:19,476 A:middle
but then we also have
a support for feedback.

383
00:17:19,476 --> 00:17:21,236 A:middle
So, gathering feedback
from the application

384
00:17:21,776 --> 00:17:25,046 A:middle
and this is an awesome
conference if I could type that,

385
00:17:25,396 --> 00:17:26,435 A:middle
[inaudible] conference.

386
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:28,976 A:middle
No, let's try that again.

387
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:33,536 A:middle
[ Pause ]

388
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:36,096 A:middle
Also in conference again.

389
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,956 A:middle
And now, Chris is going
to send an MDM command.

390
00:17:39,456 --> 00:17:42,016 A:middle
Again, another command that MDM
vendors will want to implement

391
00:17:42,586 --> 00:17:46,326 A:middle
and let's see how that
output looks on the Console.

392
00:17:47,096 --> 00:17:49,696 A:middle
So, here we have a feedback
dictionary that's returned

393
00:17:49,696 --> 00:17:51,966 A:middle
over the MDM protocol
to the MDM server.

394
00:17:52,346 --> 00:17:54,036 A:middle
So, as an MDM vendor, given

395
00:17:54,036 --> 00:17:56,276 A:middle
that there's probably
several thousand applications

396
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,266 A:middle
that will have managed
configuration preferences,

397
00:17:58,576 --> 00:17:59,936 A:middle
you will not necessarily
have able--

398
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

399
00:18:00,156 --> 00:18:00,926 A:middle
you will not be able

400
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:03,796 A:middle
to implement a [inaudible]
mechanism or--

401
00:18:03,796 --> 00:18:06,016 A:middle
and reporting mechanism
for each every app.

402
00:18:06,016 --> 00:18:08,056 A:middle
So, what you want to do
is provide mechanisms

403
00:18:08,056 --> 00:18:10,976 A:middle
for this feedback data
that we gathered and stored

404
00:18:10,976 --> 00:18:12,256 A:middle
and then further process

405
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:14,376 A:middle
by a site-specific
application or Backend.

406
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,816 A:middle
So, you act as a conduit
for gathering feedback

407
00:18:17,816 --> 00:18:19,836 A:middle
from the application
and then delivering it

408
00:18:19,836 --> 00:18:22,746 A:middle
to some other application that
will then process it further.

409
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:25,776 A:middle
So, that's a quick
overview of the App Feedback

410
00:18:25,776 --> 00:18:27,886 A:middle
and App Managed Preferences.

411
00:18:28,146 --> 00:18:30,346 A:middle
If you want to know more
about these specific features,

412
00:18:30,616 --> 00:18:33,966 A:middle
there's a session today at
3:15 regarding Extending Your

413
00:18:33,966 --> 00:18:35,976 A:middle
Applications for
Education and Enterprise use

414
00:18:36,276 --> 00:18:38,376 A:middle
and there'll be more information

415
00:18:38,376 --> 00:18:40,036 A:middle
about these specific
things there.

416
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:44,196 A:middle
So, the next thing is Managed
Open In back to default.

417
00:18:44,446 --> 00:18:45,826 A:middle
So, enterprises.

418
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:51,306 A:middle
So, we have apparently some
mail here and this seems

419
00:18:51,306 --> 00:18:53,226 A:middle
to be the new iOS
Enterprise Deployment Guide,

420
00:18:53,736 --> 00:18:55,506 A:middle
and that's great.

421
00:18:56,006 --> 00:18:58,336 A:middle
So, let's see if we can
send this over to somebody

422
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:02,126 A:middle
that has a Dropbox
account or whatnot.

423
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

424
00:19:02,126 --> 00:19:03,496 A:middle
But that's not necessarily
ideal.

425
00:19:03,496 --> 00:19:05,766 A:middle
This is a draft document,
not to be shared.

426
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:09,006 A:middle
So, I need to be able to
lock this account down

427
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:12,696 A:middle
and restrict the ability of
this document to be shared.

428
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:17,086 A:middle
So, with Managed Open In,
this mail account is managed.

429
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:20,396 A:middle
So, my MDM payload
configured this account.

430
00:19:20,746 --> 00:19:22,566 A:middle
I also installed
some applications

431
00:19:22,566 --> 00:19:23,876 A:middle
as Managed Applications.

432
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,606 A:middle
So, Chris is now going to
send a configuration profile

433
00:19:27,606 --> 00:19:30,796 A:middle
that restricts my ability
to open the document

434
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:33,126 A:middle
in any other application
besides the ones

435
00:19:33,126 --> 00:19:34,696 A:middle
that the administrator
has chosen

436
00:19:34,886 --> 00:19:35,856 A:middle
for this app to be opened.

437
00:19:35,856 --> 00:19:39,256 A:middle
And you'll notice that
I just lost Dropbox,

438
00:19:39,256 --> 00:19:42,846 A:middle
I lost Google Drive, I only
have GoodReader as an option

439
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:43,796 A:middle
to open this document in.

440
00:19:44,106 --> 00:19:45,626 A:middle
So, this is basically a way

441
00:19:45,626 --> 00:19:50,076 A:middle
of compartmentalizing
your application data

442
00:19:50,076 --> 00:19:52,706 A:middle
and your user data without
compromising the iOS

443
00:19:52,706 --> 00:19:53,416 A:middle
user experience.

444
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:53,526 A:middle
So--

445
00:19:54,516 --> 00:19:59,996 A:middle
[ Applause ]

446
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

447
00:20:00,496 --> 00:20:03,496 A:middle
So, that's Managed Open
In, and now back to Todd.

448
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,506 A:middle
>> Todd Fernandez: All right,
thank you very much guys.

449
00:20:06,276 --> 00:20:08,656 A:middle
All right, so that's
already a lot of change

450
00:20:08,736 --> 00:20:09,826 A:middle
but we're just getting started.

451
00:20:11,266 --> 00:20:12,126 A:middle
Now, I'd like to talk to you

452
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:13,866 A:middle
about the App Store
Volume Purchase Program.

453
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:17,326 A:middle
Many of you may be aware
of this already, but today,

454
00:20:18,156 --> 00:20:21,276 A:middle
education enterprise
organizations can purchase app

455
00:20:21,456 --> 00:20:23,616 A:middle
and education books
codes in bulk.

456
00:20:24,446 --> 00:20:27,896 A:middle
The App Store or B2B
Store and MDM vendors many

457
00:20:27,896 --> 00:20:30,346 A:middle
of which have integrated code
management and distribution

458
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:32,836 A:middle
into their MDM solutions
to enable organizations

459
00:20:33,276 --> 00:20:35,906 A:middle
to install those apps on
their end user systems.

460
00:20:36,376 --> 00:20:40,366 A:middle
But of course, this involves
managing spreadsheets

461
00:20:40,426 --> 00:20:43,566 A:middle
of redemption codes and
nobody really likes that,

462
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:46,406 A:middle
for two reasons,
one, it's very clumsy

463
00:20:46,406 --> 00:20:49,296 A:middle
but more importantly it
involves a permanent transfer

464
00:20:49,296 --> 00:20:52,026 A:middle
of ownership of that
asset to the end user.

465
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:54,006 A:middle
So, I'm very pleased to announce

466
00:20:54,456 --> 00:20:58,006 A:middle
that we are allowing
organizations

467
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,416 A:middle
to purchase licenses
that are revocable

468
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

469
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:08,306 A:middle
for apps instead of codes.

470
00:21:08,456 --> 00:21:09,306 A:middle
[applause] But that's not all.

471
00:21:09,956 --> 00:21:11,286 A:middle
We're adding Mac Apps
as well [applause].

472
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,686 A:middle
We're adding books
for enterprise and--

473
00:21:19,796 --> 00:21:21,146 A:middle
all right fine, nobody wants

474
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:24,016 A:middle
to read technical
manuals, I get it.

475
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:27,636 A:middle
But even better for those of you
who are working on MDM products,

476
00:21:27,906 --> 00:21:30,196 A:middle
we're going to provide a
rich set of Web Services APIs

477
00:21:30,196 --> 00:21:32,626 A:middle
to allow you to fully
integrate this new system

478
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,756 A:middle
into your products and
give a great experience

479
00:21:34,756 --> 00:21:35,486 A:middle
to our customers.

480
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:41,386 A:middle
[applause] So, let's talk
about how this system is going

481
00:21:41,386 --> 00:21:42,866 A:middle
to work starting of course

482
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:44,756 A:middle
with what the end
user will experience.

483
00:21:45,496 --> 00:21:46,946 A:middle
Once an assignment of one

484
00:21:46,946 --> 00:21:49,396 A:middle
of these revocable
licenses has been made,

485
00:21:49,636 --> 00:21:52,196 A:middle
the assigned app appears in
the user's purchase list just

486
00:21:52,196 --> 00:21:53,686 A:middle
as if they purchased
it themselves.

487
00:21:54,176 --> 00:21:55,566 A:middle
And that's great
for self-service,

488
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:57,066 A:middle
they can then tap
it to download it.

489
00:21:57,736 --> 00:21:59,636 A:middle
But we are also providing
an MDM command

490
00:21:59,636 --> 00:22:02,526 A:middle
that allows the organization
to tell the device to install

491
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

492
00:22:02,566 --> 00:22:04,656 A:middle
that app, which will
then be a managed app

493
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,866 A:middle
on iOS allowing enterprises
to get the right apps

494
00:22:08,866 --> 00:22:12,116 A:middle
on their employees' devices,
allowing schools to make sure

495
00:22:12,116 --> 00:22:15,096 A:middle
that the students have the
apps that they need to learn

496
00:22:15,096 --> 00:22:16,896 A:middle
and not be taking up class time.

497
00:22:17,676 --> 00:22:18,686 A:middle
So that's great.

498
00:22:18,686 --> 00:22:20,336 A:middle
That's how to get the
apps on the devices.

499
00:22:20,986 --> 00:22:23,046 A:middle
What about revoking a license

500
00:22:23,046 --> 00:22:26,886 A:middle
when an employee leaves their
job or student graduates?

501
00:22:27,386 --> 00:22:29,836 A:middle
Well, when the command
to revoke that license

502
00:22:29,836 --> 00:22:31,776 A:middle
from that particular user
is sent to the store,

503
00:22:32,576 --> 00:22:34,026 A:middle
that app will just
no longer appear

504
00:22:34,026 --> 00:22:35,226 A:middle
in that user's Purchased list.

505
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,936 A:middle
That of course means that
it can no longer be updated

506
00:22:38,186 --> 00:22:40,606 A:middle
or redownloaded on
additional devices that has

507
00:22:40,606 --> 00:22:42,276 A:middle
that same iTunes
account logged in.

508
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:47,186 A:middle
This will be notified that that
app has been revoked and prompt

509
00:22:47,186 --> 00:22:48,856 A:middle
to buy, which I'm
sure will make those

510
00:22:48,926 --> 00:22:51,416 A:middle
of you app developers happy
to buy their own copy.

511
00:22:52,526 --> 00:22:55,546 A:middle
Now, because the security model
is different on iOS from OS X,

512
00:22:55,546 --> 00:22:56,806 A:middle
there are some differences

513
00:22:56,806 --> 00:22:59,656 A:middle
in exactly how the Apple
behaves once it's been revoked.

514
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

515
00:23:00,356 --> 00:23:03,786 A:middle
On iOS, because apps are not
allowed to exit themselves,

516
00:23:04,406 --> 00:23:07,566 A:middle
the OS itself will enforce
that if the app will not launch

517
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:10,436 A:middle
after a 30-day grace period
allowing the user time

518
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:11,476 A:middle
to purchase their own copy.

519
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:16,136 A:middle
On OS X, the app will
need to check the receipt

520
00:23:16,136 --> 00:23:19,046 A:middle
and once the receipt has
expired after that grace period,

521
00:23:19,046 --> 00:23:20,566 A:middle
the app can then quit on launch.

522
00:23:20,886 --> 00:23:23,406 A:middle
And for those of you
OS X app developers not

523
00:23:23,406 --> 00:23:26,106 A:middle
yet checking receipts, there's
a session later this week

524
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:26,946 A:middle
that will teach you how to do it

525
00:23:26,946 --> 00:23:28,826 A:middle
and I will give you
all the details

526
00:23:28,826 --> 00:23:29,716 A:middle
at the end of this session.

527
00:23:30,256 --> 00:23:34,466 A:middle
All right, so that's
the end user experience.

528
00:23:34,896 --> 00:23:38,476 A:middle
Now, let's talk about what the
MDM product developers will need

529
00:23:38,476 --> 00:23:39,876 A:middle
to do to support
this new system.

530
00:23:40,346 --> 00:23:43,296 A:middle
And it really breaks down to
three areas of functionality.

531
00:23:43,816 --> 00:23:46,516 A:middle
First, authenticating this
organization's account

532
00:23:46,606 --> 00:23:48,296 A:middle
with the Volume Purchase
Program,

533
00:23:49,986 --> 00:23:53,066 A:middle
sending a user an invitation
to link their Apple ID

534
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:55,026 A:middle
to your organization
and I'll talk much more

535
00:23:55,026 --> 00:23:55,816 A:middle
about that in a moment.

536
00:23:56,016 --> 00:23:57,626 A:middle
And then of course the
heart of the matter,

537
00:23:57,906 --> 00:24:00,766 A:middle
being able to assign licenses,
to be able to revoke them

538
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

539
00:24:00,976 --> 00:24:02,566 A:middle
and then assign into
some other user.

540
00:24:03,146 --> 00:24:05,726 A:middle
So let's talk about
each one in turn.

541
00:24:07,136 --> 00:24:09,936 A:middle
The organization will
obtain a secure token

542
00:24:10,086 --> 00:24:12,136 A:middle
from the VPP website
where they're going

543
00:24:12,136 --> 00:24:14,096 A:middle
to purchase their
content in bulk.

544
00:24:15,306 --> 00:24:17,106 A:middle
This works great because
then you don't have

545
00:24:17,106 --> 00:24:18,966 A:middle
to store their credentials
for them, you just need

546
00:24:18,966 --> 00:24:21,476 A:middle
to provide URI for them
to enter their token.

547
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,846 A:middle
It's relatively long-lived
but will currently plan

548
00:24:24,846 --> 00:24:26,096 A:middle
to expire after a year.

549
00:24:26,246 --> 00:24:27,456 A:middle
So, it is something
that they will have

550
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:29,416 A:middle
to do periodically
but not frequently.

551
00:24:31,626 --> 00:24:33,026 A:middle
Now, user invitations.

552
00:24:33,366 --> 00:24:35,476 A:middle
This is a really
important part of the system

553
00:24:35,476 --> 00:24:36,866 A:middle
that preserves user privacy.

554
00:24:38,156 --> 00:24:41,186 A:middle
We don't want to force users to
reveal their private Apple ID

555
00:24:41,256 --> 00:24:43,246 A:middle
to the organization or
the school that's going

556
00:24:43,246 --> 00:24:44,886 A:middle
to provide them with
this content.

557
00:24:45,726 --> 00:24:48,346 A:middle
So there's a one-time
process to link their Apple ID

558
00:24:48,346 --> 00:24:51,376 A:middle
with the organization providing
content in the iTunes Store.

559
00:24:52,676 --> 00:24:56,666 A:middle
The MDM server will request
an individual URL for the user

560
00:24:56,666 --> 00:25:00,736 A:middle
that they are tracking in their
system and then be able to use

561
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

562
00:25:00,736 --> 00:25:02,446 A:middle
that URL to construct
an invitation

563
00:25:02,446 --> 00:25:05,436 A:middle
and they can send it via
email, construct a web portal,

564
00:25:05,746 --> 00:25:08,686 A:middle
or send it over MDM, which
we think is the best approach

565
00:25:08,686 --> 00:25:10,556 A:middle
if the user has a
device enrolled

566
00:25:10,936 --> 00:25:14,436 A:middle
that the MDM server knows about
and we'll show that later on.

567
00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:18,046 A:middle
Finally, the process

568
00:25:18,046 --> 00:25:19,536 A:middle
of the assigning license
couldn't be easier.

569
00:25:19,866 --> 00:25:22,056 A:middle
The MDM server can--
once it's authenticated,

570
00:25:22,056 --> 00:25:25,476 A:middle
the account with the iTunes
Store can request the list

571
00:25:25,476 --> 00:25:28,236 A:middle
of app and book purchases
that organization has made.

572
00:25:29,206 --> 00:25:31,566 A:middle
They can send request to
say assign this list of apps

573
00:25:31,566 --> 00:25:33,116 A:middle
and books to these
lists of users.

574
00:25:34,486 --> 00:25:37,626 A:middle
And then, if desired,
that's already sufficient

575
00:25:37,626 --> 00:25:40,006 A:middle
to get the content out to
those users, but if they want

576
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:42,816 A:middle
to tell the device to
install the app on the device,

577
00:25:43,236 --> 00:25:45,446 A:middle
they can send the
MDM command out.

578
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:48,576 A:middle
Revocations are the opposite.

579
00:25:48,606 --> 00:25:51,486 A:middle
They can send a list of
revoked licenses for this app

580
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,406 A:middle
from these lists of users.

581
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:59,536 A:middle
However, book assignments
just like code based model,

582
00:25:59,536 --> 00:26:02,226 A:middle
it's still permanent, a
transfer of ownership.

583
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

584
00:26:02,616 --> 00:26:04,706 A:middle
We decide to add that
to the new system

585
00:26:04,706 --> 00:26:07,446 A:middle
because that will enable
MDM providers as well

586
00:26:07,446 --> 00:26:10,006 A:middle
as organizations to use the
same system to manage both types

587
00:26:10,006 --> 00:26:12,296 A:middle
of content, but for
now at least,

588
00:26:12,606 --> 00:26:13,846 A:middle
book assignments are permanent.

589
00:26:14,356 --> 00:26:17,296 A:middle
All right, let me
give you a short--

590
00:26:17,386 --> 00:26:19,246 A:middle
walk you through a short
architecture diagram

591
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:20,466 A:middle
to give you another
way of thinking

592
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:21,706 A:middle
about the way the system works.

593
00:26:22,396 --> 00:26:24,926 A:middle
Each organization will go
to the [inaudible] website

594
00:26:24,926 --> 00:26:27,256 A:middle
and purchase whatever
app and book licenses

595
00:26:27,256 --> 00:26:28,106 A:middle
that they wish to have.

596
00:26:28,826 --> 00:26:30,826 A:middle
That information flows
into the iTunes Store.

597
00:26:32,206 --> 00:26:35,496 A:middle
The MDM server can query the
iTunes Store for those licenses

598
00:26:36,086 --> 00:26:38,686 A:middle
and then send up requests
to make assignments.

599
00:26:39,236 --> 00:26:42,646 A:middle
Once that's been done, the
device can check in with the--

600
00:26:42,756 --> 00:26:44,036 A:middle
the device will be notified

601
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:47,566 A:middle
to pull its Purchased
list and update its UI.

602
00:26:48,336 --> 00:26:51,246 A:middle
At that time, again, the user
can freely download those

603
00:26:51,246 --> 00:26:56,336 A:middle
assigned apps and books or the
MDM server can send the command

604
00:26:56,466 --> 00:27:00,396 A:middle
down to the device to tell it
to download particular book

605
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

606
00:27:00,396 --> 00:27:03,006 A:middle
or books-- sorry,
particular app or apps.

607
00:27:04,176 --> 00:27:07,146 A:middle
All right, so let's get down
another level into details

608
00:27:07,146 --> 00:27:09,456 A:middle
of how these APIs will work
and how you'll use them.

609
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:12,816 A:middle
There's a common URL prefix

610
00:27:12,876 --> 00:27:14,936 A:middle
that then you'll append
the specific service

611
00:27:14,936 --> 00:27:15,846 A:middle
that you want to use.

612
00:27:16,536 --> 00:27:20,056 A:middle
Now, the various tips and
advice that I will pass along

613
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:21,896 A:middle
through the remainder of
this section of the session.

614
00:27:22,486 --> 00:27:25,306 A:middle
One-- Important one is not the
hard code, those service URLs.

615
00:27:25,306 --> 00:27:27,886 A:middle
They may change over
time but the ser--

616
00:27:27,886 --> 00:27:30,616 A:middle
the VPPServiceConfigSrv
will always be able

617
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:32,566 A:middle
to provide you the
latest service URLs.

618
00:27:33,936 --> 00:27:38,156 A:middle
You'll provide the parameters to
these services as JSON strings

619
00:27:38,966 --> 00:27:40,456 A:middle
and the secure token

620
00:27:40,456 --> 00:27:42,476 A:middle
that I mentioned
earlier will be provided

621
00:27:42,476 --> 00:27:44,736 A:middle
with all service requests
to authenticate the call.

622
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:49,406 A:middle
What you'll get back
is also in JSON format.

623
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:52,036 A:middle
If there are any fields
that don't have a value,

624
00:27:52,236 --> 00:27:53,416 A:middle
those will not be included.

625
00:27:54,076 --> 00:27:56,496 A:middle
And, if for some strange
reason there's an error,

626
00:27:56,566 --> 00:28:00,716 A:middle
you'll get both an ErrorNumber
and user readable ErrorMessage

627
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

628
00:28:00,716 --> 00:28:04,716 A:middle
that you can provide
in your UI to the user.

629
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:05,726 A:middle
I want to clarify that.

630
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:08,286 A:middle
An ErrorMessage will map
back to a single ErrorNumber,

631
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,756 A:middle
unique ErrorNumber but each
ErrorNumber may represent a

632
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:13,226 A:middle
number of different user
visible ErrorMessages.

633
00:28:13,556 --> 00:28:17,556 A:middle
And just to give you an
idea of the kinds of errors

634
00:28:17,556 --> 00:28:20,086 A:middle
that may happen, of course,
they'll never be any errors

635
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,986 A:middle
but you probably should
handle them anyway.

636
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:26,276 A:middle
All right, now let me walk
you through a specific example

637
00:28:26,276 --> 00:28:27,876 A:middle
of how you would use
one of the services

638
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:29,316 A:middle
and this service is the one

639
00:28:29,316 --> 00:28:31,626 A:middle
where you actually
associate a particular license

640
00:28:31,656 --> 00:28:34,076 A:middle
with a particular user
effectively assigning it

641
00:28:34,816 --> 00:28:36,016 A:middle
to them.

642
00:28:36,206 --> 00:28:38,616 A:middle
Provide some information
including the secure token,

643
00:28:39,366 --> 00:28:42,536 A:middle
call the service, and then the
response might look something

644
00:28:42,536 --> 00:28:44,746 A:middle
like this where you get
some additional details

645
00:28:44,746 --> 00:28:47,196 A:middle
about the license that's been
assigned including its ID,

646
00:28:47,646 --> 00:28:48,956 A:middle
whether it's revocable or not.

647
00:28:49,776 --> 00:28:51,736 A:middle
Some other details
about what that app was.

648
00:28:52,786 --> 00:28:54,616 A:middle
You also get all the
details about the user.

649
00:28:55,176 --> 00:28:58,356 A:middle
And there are several different
ways to reference the user

650
00:28:58,356 --> 00:28:59,716 A:middle
and I'm going to cover
that in a moment.

651
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

652
00:29:00,386 --> 00:29:03,576 A:middle
So breaking this down
into their various tasks,

653
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:06,016 A:middle
you need to perform and the
services that you'll use

654
00:29:06,016 --> 00:29:07,036 A:middle
to perform those tasks.

655
00:29:07,216 --> 00:29:09,706 A:middle
I already mentioned
the VPPServiceConfigSrv

656
00:29:09,786 --> 00:29:11,686 A:middle
that you'll use to
fetch the current names

657
00:29:11,686 --> 00:29:12,996 A:middle
for all of these services.

658
00:29:14,076 --> 00:29:17,286 A:middle
The registered VPPUserSrv is
what you will use to obtain

659
00:29:17,336 --> 00:29:20,836 A:middle
that individualized invitation
URL to construct the invitation

660
00:29:20,946 --> 00:29:22,886 A:middle
to invite users to
link to the program.

661
00:29:25,906 --> 00:29:28,596 A:middle
There's a service that will
allow you to get all the details

662
00:29:28,596 --> 00:29:31,616 A:middle
about a specific user including
any licenses currently assigned

663
00:29:31,616 --> 00:29:32,176 A:middle
to that user.

664
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:35,096 A:middle
You can of course get
a list of all the users

665
00:29:35,096 --> 00:29:38,366 A:middle
in your organization including
fetching only the users

666
00:29:38,366 --> 00:29:39,246 A:middle
that have been modified

667
00:29:39,246 --> 00:29:41,226 A:middle
since the last time you
downloaded the list.

668
00:29:42,626 --> 00:29:45,056 A:middle
You can also request a
list of every license

669
00:29:45,106 --> 00:29:48,166 A:middle
that that organization
has purchased including

670
00:29:48,226 --> 00:29:50,106 A:middle
if there is a user
assigned to any of them.

671
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:55,116 A:middle
And then finally, the pair-- the
one that I showed you an example

672
00:29:55,116 --> 00:29:56,506 A:middle
of that actually
assigns a license

673
00:29:56,556 --> 00:29:59,066 A:middle
to a user and then revokes it.

674
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

675
00:30:00,496 --> 00:30:02,176 A:middle
There are a few additional
services

676
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:04,636 A:middle
that performs an important
housekeeping tasks including

677
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,406 A:middle
if you want to update
any of the user metadata,

678
00:30:06,406 --> 00:30:09,266 A:middle
if you want to store
some additional metadata

679
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:14,736 A:middle
for the organization, and if
a user leaves the organization

680
00:30:14,736 --> 00:30:18,766 A:middle
for whatever reason or no longer
needs to be provided assets,

681
00:30:19,546 --> 00:30:20,916 A:middle
you can retire that user

682
00:30:21,076 --> 00:30:22,776 A:middle
and disassociate
their iTunes account

683
00:30:22,936 --> 00:30:25,616 A:middle
which will also revoke any
revocable licenses currently

684
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:26,516 A:middle
assigned to that user.

685
00:30:27,506 --> 00:30:31,006 A:middle
You can of course later reinvite
that retired user if desired

686
00:30:32,376 --> 00:30:35,386 A:middle
by passing along their
previous user string

687
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,566 A:middle
to the registered service.

688
00:30:38,606 --> 00:30:40,436 A:middle
Now, I mentioned earlier
there are a number

689
00:30:40,436 --> 00:30:42,256 A:middle
of different user
concepts within the system.

690
00:30:42,376 --> 00:30:43,906 A:middle
So let's talk about that now.

691
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,716 A:middle
The first is your MDM
solutions idea of the user.

692
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:51,276 A:middle
That's represented in the system
by the client user ID string,

693
00:30:51,996 --> 00:30:53,716 A:middle
which is typically
going to be a UUID

694
00:30:53,926 --> 00:30:55,876 A:middle
and this may be the
representation coming

695
00:30:55,876 --> 00:30:58,116 A:middle
out of the directory
that's feeding users

696
00:30:58,116 --> 00:30:59,276 A:middle
in groups into your solution.

697
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

698
00:31:00,296 --> 00:31:03,366 A:middle
The second is the VPP--

699
00:31:03,366 --> 00:31:05,536 A:middle
the Volume Purchase
Programs ID of the user.

700
00:31:05,536 --> 00:31:07,286 A:middle
And that's represented
by the user ID.

701
00:31:08,706 --> 00:31:10,566 A:middle
Finally, there's
the user's Apple ID,

702
00:31:10,766 --> 00:31:13,356 A:middle
which again we don't want to
reveal to the MDM solution

703
00:31:13,356 --> 00:31:14,276 A:middle
and the organization,

704
00:31:14,566 --> 00:31:18,286 A:middle
so you will receive
Hash of that Apple ID.

705
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:21,326 A:middle
So there's three kinds
of users can be combined

706
00:31:21,326 --> 00:31:23,686 A:middle
at the two different key forms
or the ways that represent--

707
00:31:23,686 --> 00:31:25,846 A:middle
or referring to a
particular user.

708
00:31:26,686 --> 00:31:28,716 A:middle
The user ID is just
a single long

709
00:31:29,636 --> 00:31:33,076 A:middle
and then the other form is tuple
of the client user ID string,

710
00:31:33,076 --> 00:31:36,446 A:middle
again typically UUID and
the Hash of the Apple ID.

711
00:31:37,106 --> 00:31:40,166 A:middle
Now, these two key forms
have a one-to-one association

712
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:42,756 A:middle
at any one given time,
but that's not immutable,

713
00:31:43,056 --> 00:31:47,116 A:middle
that link can change if a
user is retired and reinvited.

714
00:31:47,116 --> 00:31:51,346 A:middle
So, let's talk a little
about the user ID key form.

715
00:31:51,926 --> 00:31:53,656 A:middle
This one is very easy
to track as it's just

716
00:31:53,656 --> 00:31:58,276 A:middle
that one single long
integer, and as I mentioned,

717
00:31:58,276 --> 00:32:01,386 A:middle
it's always tied to exactly
one client user ID string

718
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

719
00:32:01,656 --> 00:32:05,216 A:middle
but that reference can
change, and in fact can change

720
00:32:05,216 --> 00:32:07,076 A:middle
when the user accepts
the invitation.

721
00:32:07,646 --> 00:32:11,076 A:middle
So, I'm going to illustrate that
again with a little diagram.

722
00:32:11,516 --> 00:32:15,296 A:middle
So, at this point, the
MDM solution has its idea

723
00:32:15,296 --> 00:32:19,466 A:middle
of what this user's UUID
is from their directory

724
00:32:19,536 --> 00:32:21,806 A:middle
and has called the
register service

725
00:32:21,876 --> 00:32:25,546 A:middle
to obtain an individualized
URL for that user,

726
00:32:26,006 --> 00:32:27,956 A:middle
which now is identified
with user ID2 .

727
00:32:28,716 --> 00:32:30,456 A:middle
That invitation sent
out to the user

728
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:34,626 A:middle
and when the user accepts it,
the MDM server will be provided

729
00:32:34,626 --> 00:32:37,196 A:middle
with the Hash of that Apple ID.

730
00:32:37,626 --> 00:32:39,796 A:middle
Now, let's imagine that
for whatever reason

731
00:32:39,796 --> 00:32:44,336 A:middle
that user is retired, and in
fact this is not the first time

732
00:32:44,336 --> 00:32:46,476 A:middle
that this has happened,
there was a former user ID1,

733
00:32:46,476 --> 00:32:52,906 A:middle
but now retired that link,
generate a new invitation

734
00:32:52,906 --> 00:32:55,816 A:middle
for user ID3 which could be
sent out to the user again

735
00:32:56,146 --> 00:32:58,866 A:middle
which could accept-- who could
accept it with the same Apple ID

736
00:32:58,866 --> 00:32:59,896 A:middle
or different Apple ID.

737
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

738
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:04,266 A:middle
Now, let's talk about
the other key form based

739
00:33:04,266 --> 00:33:07,716 A:middle
on the MDM's servers
idea of the user.

740
00:33:08,246 --> 00:33:11,506 A:middle
Now, this more directly
maps between the MDM user

741
00:33:11,506 --> 00:33:16,986 A:middle
and the Apple ID be it Hash.

742
00:33:17,196 --> 00:33:19,236 A:middle
What you'll see is that
that hash will be null

743
00:33:19,236 --> 00:33:21,356 A:middle
until the end user has
accepted the invitation.

744
00:33:22,076 --> 00:33:24,976 A:middle
Once the user has accepted the
invitation that hash uniquely

745
00:33:24,976 --> 00:33:28,706 A:middle
and of course opaquely refers
to that end user's Apple ID,

746
00:33:29,496 --> 00:33:32,486 A:middle
however, there is a potential
problem here when you send

747
00:33:32,486 --> 00:33:33,276 A:middle
out an invitation

748
00:33:33,276 --> 00:33:34,986 A:middle
for a particular
client user ID string.

749
00:33:35,476 --> 00:33:37,236 A:middle
If that invitation,
for whatever reason

750
00:33:37,236 --> 00:33:39,746 A:middle
and let's say a student
forwards their invitation to one

751
00:33:39,746 --> 00:33:40,546 A:middle
of their classmates,

752
00:33:41,426 --> 00:33:43,716 A:middle
two different Apple IDs
can accept that invitation.

753
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,186 A:middle
There's no way to prevent that

754
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,396 A:middle
but this is almost certainly
something the admin is going

755
00:33:47,396 --> 00:33:48,186 A:middle
to want to know about.

756
00:33:50,576 --> 00:33:54,666 A:middle
Primarily because in that case,
there will be two MDM users

757
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:58,496 A:middle
and two VPP users and they
will allocate two licenses

758
00:33:58,576 --> 00:34:02,476 A:middle
for an app perhaps
but they will not get

759
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

760
00:34:02,476 --> 00:34:03,576 A:middle
to two different Apple IDs,

761
00:34:03,576 --> 00:34:05,476 A:middle
two different actual
users on devices.

762
00:34:06,306 --> 00:34:08,386 A:middle
So again, let me illustrate
this with a simple diagram.

763
00:34:08,866 --> 00:34:10,735 A:middle
Imagine two different MDM users.

764
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,626 A:middle
The MDM server generates

765
00:34:13,626 --> 00:34:15,876 A:middle
or requests two different
invitation URLs and sends

766
00:34:15,876 --> 00:34:16,846 A:middle
out those invitations.

767
00:34:18,606 --> 00:34:20,746 A:middle
One of them is accepted
with a particular Apple ID

768
00:34:22,136 --> 00:34:24,235 A:middle
and the other one is
accepted by the same Apple ID.

769
00:34:24,235 --> 00:34:26,186 A:middle
And this is the state
that you want to detect

770
00:34:26,446 --> 00:34:30,106 A:middle
and alert the user of
your admin console of.

771
00:34:33,116 --> 00:34:35,446 A:middle
So again, emphasize that there--

772
00:34:35,446 --> 00:34:37,476 A:middle
there's only one
active VPP user account

773
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:39,775 A:middle
for any given client user
ID string at one time.

774
00:34:39,775 --> 00:34:42,906 A:middle
You're going to use that
string to identify this

775
00:34:42,906 --> 00:34:44,835 A:middle
if you're using this
key form as opposed

776
00:34:44,835 --> 00:34:46,666 A:middle
to the user ID VPP key form.

777
00:34:48,116 --> 00:34:52,636 A:middle
If you want to get a retired
user back, you'll also have

778
00:34:52,636 --> 00:34:57,056 A:middle
to provide the Hash that
you had for that user.

779
00:34:57,196 --> 00:34:59,826 A:middle
So now I want to pass
along some advice from some

780
00:34:59,826 --> 00:35:02,766 A:middle
of the engineers on my team who
are the first to adopt this API

781
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

782
00:35:02,766 --> 00:35:04,706 A:middle
and they have some
things that they'd

783
00:35:04,706 --> 00:35:05,576 A:middle
like me to share with you.

784
00:35:06,756 --> 00:35:09,386 A:middle
So one important decision is
which key form you want to use

785
00:35:09,556 --> 00:35:11,596 A:middle
and they strongly recommend
that you choose one of them

786
00:35:11,596 --> 00:35:14,386 A:middle
and always use that consistently
because if you want--

787
00:35:14,386 --> 00:35:15,726 A:middle
if you try to mix them,
you're going to have

788
00:35:15,726 --> 00:35:17,616 A:middle
to very carefully keep
them strictly in sync.

789
00:35:18,126 --> 00:35:24,496 A:middle
Next, I want to talk about
a few individual areas

790
00:35:24,646 --> 00:35:26,346 A:middle
of the system, first, users.

791
00:35:27,606 --> 00:35:29,956 A:middle
When choo-- I've already
mentioned this several times

792
00:35:29,956 --> 00:35:33,066 A:middle
that when you're choosing
what to represent each user

793
00:35:33,066 --> 00:35:37,396 A:middle
in your MDM Solution, you
want to pick a Primary Key

794
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:39,696 A:middle
that won't change so you
don't want to use a username

795
00:35:39,696 --> 00:35:42,266 A:middle
or an email address
'cause you won't be able

796
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:44,466 A:middle
to change this once they have
been invited and enrolled.

797
00:35:45,606 --> 00:35:47,506 A:middle
We strongly recommend a UUID.

798
00:35:48,026 --> 00:35:51,996 A:middle
You can make your server
the truth for user accounts

799
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:54,696 A:middle
but you're going to have to
handle retired accounts then

800
00:35:54,996 --> 00:35:56,936 A:middle
which you can always fetch using

801
00:35:56,936 --> 00:36:02,856 A:middle
to get VPP user service
'cause users may unenroll

802
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

803
00:36:02,856 --> 00:36:04,956 A:middle
from the service,
you may retire them.

804
00:36:05,856 --> 00:36:08,516 A:middle
You can always reregister that
user and send a new invitation

805
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:14,846 A:middle
but of course that may be
linked from a new Apple ID.

806
00:36:14,966 --> 00:36:17,466 A:middle
One important reason to keep
track of retired users is

807
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,956 A:middle
that if you have actually
transferred any irrevocable

808
00:36:19,956 --> 00:36:24,346 A:middle
licenses for books because you
won't want to assign another--

809
00:36:24,346 --> 00:36:27,876 A:middle
if the user was retired by
accident or for whatever reason,

810
00:36:27,876 --> 00:36:30,316 A:middle
the student came back to
school, you don't want to end

811
00:36:30,316 --> 00:36:33,176 A:middle
up transferring a second
irrevocable book license to them

812
00:36:33,176 --> 00:36:34,106 A:middle
when they already have one.

813
00:36:34,946 --> 00:36:37,806 A:middle
Next, let's talk a little
bit more about licenses.

814
00:36:38,536 --> 00:36:42,766 A:middle
So similar to not relying on
the names of the service URLs,

815
00:36:43,286 --> 00:36:45,246 A:middle
you don't want to assume
that you know forever

816
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:47,796 A:middle
which license types are
revocable and which are not.

817
00:36:48,116 --> 00:36:50,736 A:middle
You want to always use-- is
that irrevocable attribute

818
00:36:50,836 --> 00:36:52,486 A:middle
to determine whether a
particular license can

819
00:36:52,486 --> 00:36:52,996 A:middle
be revoked.

820
00:36:53,386 --> 00:36:58,096 A:middle
Another important consideration
is how to handle the difference

821
00:36:58,096 --> 00:37:00,066 A:middle
between assigning a
license to the user

822
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

823
00:37:00,516 --> 00:37:02,676 A:middle
and actually sending
the MDM Command

824
00:37:02,706 --> 00:37:07,966 A:middle
to tell the device
to install that app.

825
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:12,166 A:middle
You can assign licenses before
inviting the user has accepted

826
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:16,176 A:middle
the invitation and associate
their Apple ID but you may want

827
00:37:16,176 --> 00:37:18,616 A:middle
to wait until they've actually
accepted the invitation

828
00:37:18,616 --> 00:37:20,556 A:middle
and that you have a
hash for their Apple ID

829
00:37:21,126 --> 00:37:23,576 A:middle
because you don't want to end
up assigning licenses to users

830
00:37:23,576 --> 00:37:24,936 A:middle
that never actually used them.

831
00:37:25,646 --> 00:37:27,896 A:middle
And you want to incur-- make
it easy for organizations

832
00:37:27,896 --> 00:37:29,016 A:middle
to prevent that from happening.

833
00:37:30,096 --> 00:37:32,656 A:middle
Now similarly, you can make
the MDM Server the truth

834
00:37:32,656 --> 00:37:35,406 A:middle
for revocable license
assignments but you don't have

835
00:37:35,406 --> 00:37:37,696 A:middle
to worry about tracking
unassigned license IDs

836
00:37:37,696 --> 00:37:40,456 A:middle
because when you call that
service to assign a license

837
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:42,526 A:middle
to a user, it will pick one

838
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,086 A:middle
of the unassigned
licenses from the pool.

839
00:37:45,456 --> 00:37:48,316 A:middle
However, once you've assigned
a revocable license you do want

840
00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:50,346 A:middle
to track those because
you'll need the license ID

841
00:37:50,346 --> 00:37:53,576 A:middle
in order to revoke them.

842
00:37:53,786 --> 00:37:58,806 A:middle
Finally, when thinking about
installing apps in the command,

843
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:02,346 A:middle
you've probably in the UI want
to separate the assignment

844
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

845
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:03,466 A:middle
from the installation.

846
00:38:03,466 --> 00:38:06,176 A:middle
It may seem at first like a
great idea to be able to do both

847
00:38:06,176 --> 00:38:10,066 A:middle
at once but because of
the hugely scalable nature

848
00:38:10,066 --> 00:38:12,156 A:middle
of the iTunes Store,
there may be some delay

849
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:13,766 A:middle
in the notification of--

850
00:38:13,766 --> 00:38:15,806 A:middle
to the device that
assignment has been made

851
00:38:16,436 --> 00:38:18,696 A:middle
and if the command comes
in before the assignment,

852
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,396 A:middle
before the device
knows it's entitled

853
00:38:20,396 --> 00:38:21,906 A:middle
to that app, it will fail.

854
00:38:23,116 --> 00:38:24,896 A:middle
There's also the
possibility that a student

855
00:38:24,946 --> 00:38:26,816 A:middle
for whatever reason may
have signed out with

856
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:30,746 A:middle
that iTunes account and if the--
that account is not signed in,

857
00:38:31,356 --> 00:38:33,786 A:middle
the device won't know that
it's authorized for that app

858
00:38:33,786 --> 00:38:38,116 A:middle
and again, the command
will fail.

859
00:38:38,326 --> 00:38:41,326 A:middle
So in summarizing, we
have made some big changes

860
00:38:41,326 --> 00:38:43,046 A:middle
to the App Store
Volume Purchase Program.

861
00:38:43,236 --> 00:38:45,096 A:middle
We've added revocable
app assignments.

862
00:38:45,736 --> 00:38:47,016 A:middle
We've allowed new systems

863
00:38:47,016 --> 00:38:48,776 A:middle
that also support
permanent book assignments.

864
00:38:49,456 --> 00:38:51,446 A:middle
There's a new MDM
Command to tell the device

865
00:38:51,446 --> 00:38:53,786 A:middle
to install whatever apps
are assigned to them.

866
00:38:54,716 --> 00:38:57,436 A:middle
All of these is fully
integrated with iOS Managed apps

867
00:38:57,726 --> 00:38:59,656 A:middle
so that organizations
can be confident

868
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

869
00:39:00,136 --> 00:39:03,056 A:middle
in using this new system while
still protecting their secured

870
00:39:03,056 --> 00:39:06,336 A:middle
data being used by those apps,
whatever those apps may be

871
00:39:07,106 --> 00:39:10,476 A:middle
and all of this works really
great with OS X caching server

872
00:39:11,256 --> 00:39:13,866 A:middle
so that even if a
school for example needs

873
00:39:13,866 --> 00:39:18,656 A:middle
to assign a thousand copies of
20 apps to all their devices

874
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,756 A:middle
on campus, they can only--

875
00:39:20,756 --> 00:39:23,096 A:middle
they only have to download
each app once to their site

876
00:39:23,096 --> 00:39:24,016 A:middle
to the caching server.

877
00:39:24,576 --> 00:39:28,486 A:middle
And with that, I'd like to turn

878
00:39:28,486 --> 00:39:30,586 A:middle
to our final section
of the session today.

879
00:39:31,326 --> 00:39:33,436 A:middle
And I know some of you might
be wondering what I mean

880
00:39:33,436 --> 00:39:34,816 A:middle
by Streamlined Device
Enrollment.

881
00:39:36,196 --> 00:39:37,276 A:middle
Well, those of you
who have worked

882
00:39:37,276 --> 00:39:40,666 A:middle
on MDM products have already
had to solve this problem

883
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:42,656 A:middle
of how do I establish
that initial connection

884
00:39:42,656 --> 00:39:44,656 A:middle
from each device back
to my MDM server.

885
00:39:45,476 --> 00:39:47,366 A:middle
Some of you have created
apps for the App Store.

886
00:39:47,926 --> 00:39:50,826 A:middle
Some of you created web
portals but those require

887
00:39:50,826 --> 00:39:53,376 A:middle
that the organization using your
product then train their users

888
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:55,516 A:middle
how to use those apps,
where to find them,

889
00:39:55,906 --> 00:39:57,276 A:middle
how to complete the enrollment.

890
00:39:57,636 --> 00:39:59,556 A:middle
Some of you have documented
how to use our own tools

891
00:39:59,556 --> 00:40:02,196 A:middle
like Apple Configurator to
complete that initial step.

892
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

893
00:40:03,396 --> 00:40:05,786 A:middle
But wouldn't it be easier
if we gave you this.

894
00:40:07,876 --> 00:40:09,836 A:middle
[laughter] An easy button
for device enrollment.

895
00:40:12,336 --> 00:40:13,016 A:middle
We think so.

896
00:40:13,016 --> 00:40:14,966 A:middle
We think this will be great
both for the organization

897
00:40:15,106 --> 00:40:17,036 A:middle
and for the end users and
that's what we're doing.

898
00:40:17,626 --> 00:40:20,926 A:middle
We're adding a new
enrollment method solely

899
00:40:20,926 --> 00:40:22,886 A:middle
for devices purchased
by an organization.

900
00:40:22,886 --> 00:40:27,136 A:middle
This is not for BYOD but for
organization-owned devices,

901
00:40:27,596 --> 00:40:28,576 A:middle
there's two steps.

902
00:40:29,066 --> 00:40:32,856 A:middle
One for the organization, they
need to provide a small number

903
00:40:32,856 --> 00:40:35,506 A:middle
of settings for how they want
this enrollment to be performed

904
00:40:35,616 --> 00:40:36,776 A:middle
to this new Apple service

905
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:40,336 A:middle
and we have integrated the
enrollment process right

906
00:40:40,336 --> 00:40:43,826 A:middle
into the Setup Assistant in
both iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks

907
00:40:44,116 --> 00:40:46,546 A:middle
to give the user the
standard out-of-box device

908
00:40:46,546 --> 00:40:46,986 A:middle
experience [applause].

909
00:40:51,266 --> 00:40:53,576 A:middle
So let's talk about
how this will look

910
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,836 A:middle
from both the organization
and the end user perspective.

911
00:40:56,306 --> 00:40:57,106 A:middle
So what's the workflow

912
00:40:57,106 --> 00:40:59,276 A:middle
for an organization now
using this new service?

913
00:40:59,886 --> 00:41:01,826 A:middle
Well, they hopefully
order lots and lots

914
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

915
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,666 A:middle
of Apple devices from us.

916
00:41:04,516 --> 00:41:07,636 A:middle
They assign those devices
to this new service.

917
00:41:08,896 --> 00:41:11,106 A:middle
They decide which settings
that they want to use

918
00:41:11,206 --> 00:41:12,376 A:middle
for those devices to be enrolled

919
00:41:12,376 --> 00:41:14,256 A:middle
and they can use different
settings for different groups

920
00:41:14,256 --> 00:41:16,506 A:middle
of devices, for example
different schools.

921
00:41:16,856 --> 00:41:21,196 A:middle
They receive their shipment of
the devices and they hand them

922
00:41:21,196 --> 00:41:22,946 A:middle
out in the box to
their end user.

923
00:41:24,266 --> 00:41:25,396 A:middle
That's all they have to do.

924
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,656 A:middle
[applause] So what does the
user do when they get this box?

925
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:31,656 A:middle
Well, they open it just

926
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,316 A:middle
as if they purchased it
from the Apple store.

927
00:41:33,886 --> 00:41:36,046 A:middle
They begin walking through
the Standard Setup Assistant.

928
00:41:36,376 --> 00:41:40,596 A:middle
They choose their network
then they're prompted

929
00:41:40,596 --> 00:41:43,596 A:middle
by your MDM Solution for
credentials to authenticate

930
00:41:43,596 --> 00:41:45,486 A:middle
who they are to make sure

931
00:41:45,486 --> 00:41:47,566 A:middle
that only authorized
users are enrolling

932
00:41:47,566 --> 00:41:49,996 A:middle
in the Device Management
System deployed

933
00:41:49,996 --> 00:41:55,146 A:middle
by that organization, that's it.

934
00:41:55,426 --> 00:41:56,896 A:middle
So let's start talking
about a little bit of--

935
00:41:56,896 --> 00:41:57,706 A:middle
few of the details.

936
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,326 A:middle
There are a couple
of critical settings,

937
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

938
00:42:00,326 --> 00:42:03,176 A:middle
the most important one
is the URL for enrolling

939
00:42:03,176 --> 00:42:04,796 A:middle
in your Device Management
Solutions.

940
00:42:06,436 --> 00:42:09,256 A:middle
There's also an option the
organization can decide whether

941
00:42:09,256 --> 00:42:11,556 A:middle
or not they want to allow
the user to skip enrollment

942
00:42:11,556 --> 00:42:14,106 A:middle
or whether they want to make it
mandatory and prevent the user

943
00:42:14,106 --> 00:42:16,276 A:middle
from preceding through
setup and using the device

944
00:42:16,276 --> 00:42:18,856 A:middle
without accepting enrollment
in Remote Device Management.

945
00:42:20,256 --> 00:42:23,116 A:middle
There are a few additional
options specific to iOS devices,

946
00:42:24,086 --> 00:42:26,906 A:middle
first of which is that you--
the organization could decide

947
00:42:26,906 --> 00:42:28,846 A:middle
that they want to
supervise these devices.

948
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:31,726 A:middle
You may not realize
what that means,

949
00:42:31,726 --> 00:42:33,076 A:middle
you'll no longer be required

950
00:42:33,076 --> 00:42:35,126 A:middle
to use Apple Configurators
Supervised devices.

951
00:42:35,126 --> 00:42:37,056 A:middle
It can now be done
over-the-air using this new

952
00:42:37,056 --> 00:42:37,956 A:middle
enrollment service.

953
00:42:42,346 --> 00:42:44,246 A:middle
[applause] I alluded to
this earlier but in addition

954
00:42:44,246 --> 00:42:45,896 A:middle
to that change to supervision,

955
00:42:46,156 --> 00:42:47,666 A:middle
we're also separating
the concept

956
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:50,356 A:middle
of supervision giving you access
to additional restrictions

957
00:42:50,356 --> 00:42:52,736 A:middle
in settings from the
pairing restrictions

958
00:42:53,306 --> 00:42:55,796 A:middle
and the organization can now
choose whether or not they want

959
00:42:55,796 --> 00:42:57,656 A:middle
to prevent the supervised device

960
00:42:57,656 --> 00:42:59,706 A:middle
from pairing from--
with any Mac.

961
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

962
00:43:02,556 --> 00:43:04,206 A:middle
[applause] We think this
will be great in schools

963
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,966 A:middle
where students-- where
schools really want

964
00:43:05,966 --> 00:43:07,596 A:middle
to have the additional
restrictions

965
00:43:07,596 --> 00:43:09,916 A:middle
but also want their students
to be able to connect a Mac--

966
00:43:10,276 --> 00:43:13,236 A:middle
or sorry connect an iOS device
to a Mac to get their photo

967
00:43:13,236 --> 00:43:15,866 A:middle
or video content off to
edit in iPhoto or iMovie.

968
00:43:16,656 --> 00:43:19,946 A:middle
And then finally, I think
you'll like this as well,

969
00:43:20,856 --> 00:43:23,876 A:middle
for devices that have been
enrolled using this new service,

970
00:43:24,846 --> 00:43:26,906 A:middle
the organization can also
choose to prevent their users

971
00:43:26,906 --> 00:43:28,516 A:middle
from removing MDM enrollment

972
00:43:28,516 --> 00:43:30,836 A:middle
so that they can be confident
the device will continue

973
00:43:30,836 --> 00:43:32,656 A:middle
to be enrolled and
manageable over-the-air.

974
00:43:34,336 --> 00:43:37,946 A:middle
Now that's all great, that's
all about device enrollment,

975
00:43:38,156 --> 00:43:39,336 A:middle
but we didn't stop there either.

976
00:43:40,186 --> 00:43:42,806 A:middle
We also wanted to streamline
the entire setup experience

977
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:44,226 A:middle
so that part of the Settings

978
00:43:44,226 --> 00:43:47,186 A:middle
of this new service also allow
an organization to decide

979
00:43:47,186 --> 00:43:49,486 A:middle
to skip certain panes
in the setup assistant.

980
00:43:49,886 --> 00:43:52,556 A:middle
For example, if a school doesn't
want to ask their 10-year-olds

981
00:43:52,556 --> 00:43:54,966 A:middle
to decide whether or not they
want a location service is

982
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:56,636 A:middle
enabled or whether they're going

983
00:43:56,636 --> 00:44:01,166 A:middle
to send diagnostics
back to Apple.

984
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

985
00:44:01,166 --> 00:44:03,726 A:middle
So again, let's turn from
the way the feature--

986
00:44:03,726 --> 00:44:06,276 A:middle
the system works to
what work you need to do

987
00:44:06,826 --> 00:44:08,666 A:middle
and it again breaks
down to three areas.

988
00:44:09,496 --> 00:44:13,056 A:middle
Similar account authentication
to the new App Store VPP.

989
00:44:13,056 --> 00:44:16,666 A:middle
You'll need to create a settings
editor for that small handful

990
00:44:16,666 --> 00:44:17,406 A:middle
of settings for the--

991
00:44:17,406 --> 00:44:18,716 A:middle
your customers to be able

992
00:44:18,716 --> 00:44:20,696 A:middle
to specify how they want
their devices enrolled.

993
00:44:22,396 --> 00:44:25,436 A:middle
And you'll need to be able to
communicate with the new service

994
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:27,416 A:middle
to tell it which groups
the device you should get

995
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:28,246 A:middle
which settings.

996
00:44:30,906 --> 00:44:33,116 A:middle
So walk you through an
architecture diagram

997
00:44:33,116 --> 00:44:34,176 A:middle
to show you how this will work.

998
00:44:35,516 --> 00:44:37,306 A:middle
The organization
purchases devices.

999
00:44:38,726 --> 00:44:40,736 A:middle
They add those devices
into this new service.

1000
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:44,596 A:middle
Your MDM Solution talks to
the enrollment service to find

1001
00:44:44,596 --> 00:44:47,596 A:middle
out the list of devices that
are eligible for this service,

1002
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:50,086 A:middle
pushes up the settings for
groups of those devices.

1003
00:44:50,956 --> 00:44:53,696 A:middle
Once that's been done,
as devices start to go

1004
00:44:53,696 --> 00:44:54,766 A:middle
through the setup assistant,

1005
00:44:55,266 --> 00:44:57,816 A:middle
they contact the enrollment
service to get their Settings

1006
00:44:58,886 --> 00:45:02,486 A:middle
and enroll in your MDM Server
which can then manage them

1007
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1008
00:45:02,486 --> 00:45:03,546 A:middle
in all of the ways we've talked

1009
00:45:03,546 --> 00:45:05,346 A:middle
about earlier via
the MDM Protocol

1010
00:45:05,346 --> 00:45:06,566 A:middle
and Configuration Profiles.

1011
00:45:09,576 --> 00:45:11,846 A:middle
So again there are a
couple of these tasks

1012
00:45:11,846 --> 00:45:13,666 A:middle
and there are services
that you'll use

1013
00:45:13,666 --> 00:45:17,116 A:middle
to perform those tasks to
get started with the service,

1014
00:45:17,116 --> 00:45:19,126 A:middle
to get the account details
for that organization,

1015
00:45:19,576 --> 00:45:20,726 A:middle
to fetch the device list,

1016
00:45:23,036 --> 00:45:25,796 A:middle
handling the settings
whether you're defining them

1017
00:45:25,796 --> 00:45:27,836 A:middle
and pushing them up to the
service and then assigning them

1018
00:45:27,836 --> 00:45:30,296 A:middle
to groups of devices and
fetching the settings back.

1019
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:33,586 A:middle
And then some more
housekeeping services

1020
00:45:34,006 --> 00:45:35,916 A:middle
that fetch specific
details about devices.

1021
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:38,476 A:middle
If you have to remove
devices from the services

1022
00:45:38,476 --> 00:45:39,986 A:middle
if an organization sells them.

1023
00:45:41,006 --> 00:45:42,956 A:middle
Or to remove settings that
they're no longer using.

1024
00:45:43,496 --> 00:45:49,556 A:middle
And so just to further encourage
you to integrate this service

1025
00:45:49,556 --> 00:45:50,636 A:middle
as quickly as possible,

1026
00:45:50,636 --> 00:45:52,866 A:middle
I just want to quickly
illustrate what the OS X setup

1027
00:45:52,866 --> 00:45:54,496 A:middle
experience looks like today.

1028
00:45:55,676 --> 00:45:58,526 A:middle
You have to go through these 14
screens to get to where you want

1029
00:45:58,526 --> 00:46:02,336 A:middle
to be which is that user-- using
their Mac to work or learn.

1030
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1031
00:46:03,456 --> 00:46:04,886 A:middle
Now I know you want
to see what it looks

1032
00:46:04,886 --> 00:46:07,286 A:middle
like using the service fully.

1033
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,186 A:middle
But I don't want to show
it to you in slides.

1034
00:46:09,446 --> 00:46:11,296 A:middle
I'm going to ask you to Jussi
and Chris to come back up

1035
00:46:11,656 --> 00:46:14,726 A:middle
and show you the-- both of
these systems working together

1036
00:46:15,236 --> 00:46:17,876 A:middle
so that all of you are really
excited about going off

1037
00:46:17,876 --> 00:46:19,366 A:middle
and integrating both
of these services

1038
00:46:19,366 --> 00:46:21,536 A:middle
so that together we can
provide our customers

1039
00:46:21,576 --> 00:46:23,886 A:middle
with an outstanding
setup experience

1040
00:46:23,886 --> 00:46:25,156 A:middle
in education and enterprise.

1041
00:46:25,456 --> 00:46:27,466 A:middle
So we're going to show
you from taking the device

1042
00:46:27,466 --> 00:46:31,146 A:middle
out of the box, enrolling it in
MDM and assigning it content.

1043
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:32,426 A:middle
So guys, take it away.

1044
00:46:32,686 --> 00:46:35,226 A:middle
>> Jussi: All right,
thank you Todd.

1045
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:38,106 A:middle
So I'm not going to have
my Mac Book in a box.

1046
00:46:38,206 --> 00:46:41,006 A:middle
So this is basically
imagine if this came in a box

1047
00:46:41,236 --> 00:46:43,576 A:middle
on a container of like
thousands of Mac Books

1048
00:46:43,956 --> 00:46:45,586 A:middle
and this is the setup that
I'm going to go through.

1049
00:46:45,846 --> 00:46:49,436 A:middle
So power it up and I get
to see some of the panes

1050
00:46:49,436 --> 00:46:51,446 A:middle
that I usually see, and it's not

1051
00:46:51,446 --> 00:46:53,776 A:middle
that this setup experiences
is really slow today, I mean,

1052
00:46:53,896 --> 00:46:55,966 A:middle
we have pretty fast going
through the setup today.

1053
00:46:56,266 --> 00:46:59,226 A:middle
This is just faster than
what we have right now.

1054
00:46:59,656 --> 00:47:02,096 A:middle
So I set my country,
set my keyboard

1055
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1056
00:47:02,516 --> 00:47:03,546 A:middle
and the first thing that's--

1057
00:47:03,966 --> 00:47:05,486 A:middle
or it still needs
to pick a network.

1058
00:47:06,586 --> 00:47:11,586 A:middle
So let's go to ACME Wi-Fi, I
you have to Wi-Fi, go ACME.

1059
00:47:11,786 --> 00:47:15,036 A:middle
And what Todd is--
Todd is explaining is

1060
00:47:15,036 --> 00:47:18,236 A:middle
that we have MDM sever that has
implemented this streamlined

1061
00:47:18,236 --> 00:47:19,286 A:middle
device enrollment protocol.

1062
00:47:19,576 --> 00:47:23,216 A:middle
So now, my setup assistant
has just contacted Apple.

1063
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:25,676 A:middle
So what happened is
that the configuration

1064
00:47:25,736 --> 00:47:28,766 A:middle
for this machine was found
in the Apple services

1065
00:47:29,066 --> 00:47:31,536 A:middle
and it basically said
you are called ACME, Inc.

1066
00:47:31,646 --> 00:47:33,826 A:middle
Here's the number to call if
you don't know what this is

1067
00:47:34,096 --> 00:47:36,236 A:middle
and would you like to
apply these settings.

1068
00:47:36,616 --> 00:47:39,396 A:middle
So-- and in this case, I have
an option of skipping this

1069
00:47:39,706 --> 00:47:41,326 A:middle
or accepting the configuration.

1070
00:47:41,936 --> 00:47:45,346 A:middle
So I will accept
this configuration.

1071
00:47:45,346 --> 00:47:46,306 A:middle
And now what happened is

1072
00:47:46,306 --> 00:47:50,806 A:middle
that the configuration
contains a call home URL.

1073
00:47:51,176 --> 00:47:53,436 A:middle
So the MDM server
has a new feature

1074
00:47:53,436 --> 00:47:54,876 A:middle
for authenticating users.

1075
00:47:55,086 --> 00:47:58,176 A:middle
So this system is no longer
talking to Apple services.

1076
00:47:58,176 --> 00:48:01,146 A:middle
This now talking to an MDM
server that will be hosted

1077
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1078
00:48:01,146 --> 00:48:03,986 A:middle
by the organization would
be in the company or in--

1079
00:48:03,986 --> 00:48:07,106 A:middle
at school and the username
password is what I would use

1080
00:48:07,276 --> 00:48:10,476 A:middle
to log in to that company's,
that school's systems.

1081
00:48:10,866 --> 00:48:13,246 A:middle
So I will be-- in this
case, I will be Jack.

1082
00:48:14,426 --> 00:48:16,946 A:middle
And Jack is going to
have a password hopefully

1083
00:48:16,946 --> 00:48:17,536 A:middle
that I can remember.

1084
00:48:17,536 --> 00:48:21,636 A:middle
And now we are done
with the configuration.

1085
00:48:22,036 --> 00:48:24,086 A:middle
So I still have to
create a local pass--

1086
00:48:24,086 --> 00:48:25,336 A:middle
local user for this machine.

1087
00:48:25,866 --> 00:48:32,026 A:middle
And there it goes,
Jack and that's it.

1088
00:48:32,406 --> 00:48:35,456 A:middle
So if you saw the-- saw the
screens that we have before,

1089
00:48:35,726 --> 00:48:38,866 A:middle
we didn't get to see a do I
want to register this machine

1090
00:48:38,866 --> 00:48:40,506 A:middle
because this was
organization purchased.

1091
00:48:40,706 --> 00:48:41,636 A:middle
It doesn't really make sense

1092
00:48:41,636 --> 00:48:43,316 A:middle
to have the individuals
still register it again.

1093
00:48:43,716 --> 00:48:47,426 A:middle
I didn't get to see an Apple ID
because the organization decided

1094
00:48:47,426 --> 00:48:49,926 A:middle
that that may not be applicable
for this system or this user.

1095
00:48:50,446 --> 00:48:51,476 A:middle
And here we are.

1096
00:48:51,476 --> 00:48:53,426 A:middle
We are ready to set
the system or ready

1097
00:48:53,426 --> 00:48:54,716 A:middle
to put the system in use.

1098
00:48:55,046 --> 00:48:58,976 A:middle
And I land finder with a
wonderful and new background.

1099
00:48:59,716 --> 00:49:00,636 A:middle
Here we go.

1100
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1101
00:49:00,636 --> 00:49:01,466 A:middle
Let's go surfing.

1102
00:49:01,846 --> 00:49:07,436 A:middle
And when I go to my
preferences I noticed

1103
00:49:07,436 --> 00:49:09,836 A:middle
that I already have a
enrollment profile here.

1104
00:49:09,836 --> 00:49:13,956 A:middle
So I have a system-- I have
a profile that was installed

1105
00:49:13,956 --> 00:49:16,666 A:middle
on the system as part of
enrolling into the MDM service.

1106
00:49:16,916 --> 00:49:19,756 A:middle
So here I have remote
management already enabled

1107
00:49:19,826 --> 00:49:22,996 A:middle
and now the organization
can send me any profiles

1108
00:49:22,996 --> 00:49:24,806 A:middle
that are applicable
for this user

1109
00:49:25,016 --> 00:49:27,456 A:middle
on this system and
I'm good to go.

1110
00:49:27,746 --> 00:49:29,886 A:middle
So that's the setup
experience on the Mac.

1111
00:49:30,516 --> 00:49:35,656 A:middle
[ Applause ]

1112
00:49:36,156 --> 00:49:39,516 A:middle
So an iOS device, so I
have an iPhone in the box

1113
00:49:39,816 --> 00:49:41,266 A:middle
that I did cut open, sorry,

1114
00:49:41,266 --> 00:49:43,736 A:middle
so we get to have the
nice woosh effect.

1115
00:49:44,096 --> 00:49:44,996 A:middle
Here we go.

1116
00:49:45,536 --> 00:49:47,966 A:middle
And I did power it
on, sorry, I cheated.

1117
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:49,506 A:middle
So it's already on.

1118
00:49:50,116 --> 00:49:51,906 A:middle
So if and go to the
phone please.

1119
00:49:52,886 --> 00:49:54,076 A:middle
There we go.

1120
00:49:54,076 --> 00:49:55,846 A:middle
I could learn lots
of languages here.

1121
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:57,856 A:middle
I think that means caller.

1122
00:49:58,126 --> 00:50:00,666 A:middle
Let's go set this up.

1123
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1124
00:50:01,316 --> 00:50:02,156 A:middle
Here we go.

1125
00:50:02,356 --> 00:50:04,576 A:middle
So again, I get to
choose my language.

1126
00:50:05,716 --> 00:50:07,076 A:middle
I'm still in the US.

1127
00:50:08,056 --> 00:50:10,486 A:middle
I get to choose my
ACME Wi-Fi again.

1128
00:50:10,816 --> 00:50:13,916 A:middle
So here, the configuration
profile that was downloaded

1129
00:50:13,916 --> 00:50:17,806 A:middle
from the streamlined device
enrollment service now got the

1130
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,836 A:middle
record from Apple again.

1131
00:50:19,836 --> 00:50:22,946 A:middle
And we know that
this device needs

1132
00:50:22,946 --> 00:50:24,076 A:middle
to be configured for the system.

1133
00:50:24,386 --> 00:50:26,746 A:middle
And you'll notice that I
don't have an option to skip.

1134
00:50:27,036 --> 00:50:31,426 A:middle
So I have to go through this
setup assistant or the iOS setup

1135
00:50:31,426 --> 00:50:33,496 A:middle
with this configuration
from my organization.

1136
00:50:33,836 --> 00:50:36,276 A:middle
So there's no option to opt out.

1137
00:50:36,276 --> 00:50:39,456 A:middle
So again, I'll configure
this device.

1138
00:50:39,456 --> 00:50:43,156 A:middle
And again I'll log
into my company account

1139
00:50:43,156 --> 00:50:45,086 A:middle
and again this device
is now talking

1140
00:50:45,086 --> 00:50:47,936 A:middle
to the MDM server
authentication part that's going

1141
00:50:47,936 --> 00:50:50,456 A:middle
to be implemented by all the
new MDM servers out there.

1142
00:50:51,246 --> 00:50:59,906 A:middle
So I'll log in here, and I
get configurations set down.

1143
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1144
00:51:00,196 --> 00:51:02,726 A:middle
And here we are installing
the configuration

1145
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,276 A:middle
from a company and
I'm good to go.

1146
00:51:05,976 --> 00:51:08,576 A:middle
So here I am in my home screen.

1147
00:51:08,926 --> 00:51:11,776 A:middle
I have a basically a clean
system but now if I go

1148
00:51:11,776 --> 00:51:15,506 A:middle
to my settings and
look at some details.

1149
00:51:15,926 --> 00:51:18,606 A:middle
So notice that this
device is supervised.

1150
00:51:19,106 --> 00:51:22,396 A:middle
So this device was not
connected to Apple Configurator.

1151
00:51:22,396 --> 00:51:24,656 A:middle
It was never plugged
into any system

1152
00:51:24,946 --> 00:51:26,136 A:middle
but it's already supervised.

1153
00:51:26,366 --> 00:51:28,046 A:middle
So I can now take
advantage of some

1154
00:51:28,046 --> 00:51:29,876 A:middle
of the new supervised features

1155
00:51:29,876 --> 00:51:32,756 A:middle
like installing [inaudible]
apps, doing other restrictions

1156
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,356 A:middle
that wouldn't apply to
non-supervised devices.

1157
00:51:35,666 --> 00:51:38,646 A:middle
So this is supervision without
tethering using the streamlined

1158
00:51:38,646 --> 00:51:40,206 A:middle
device configuration service.

1159
00:51:40,926 --> 00:51:43,156 A:middle
And other part is
that you'll notice

1160
00:51:43,156 --> 00:51:44,966 A:middle
that I have configuration
profiles installed.

1161
00:51:44,966 --> 00:51:47,716 A:middle
And if I'm looking
at my MDM profile,

1162
00:51:47,716 --> 00:51:49,376 A:middle
there is no remove button.

1163
00:51:49,376 --> 00:51:53,116 A:middle
So the only way-- [applause]
thank you, yes, yes please.

1164
00:51:55,806 --> 00:51:59,796 A:middle
There's no way for the user
to exit the management state

1165
00:51:59,796 --> 00:52:02,576 A:middle
and if they restore the phone,

1166
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1167
00:52:02,576 --> 00:52:04,296 A:middle
basically erase/install
the phone,

1168
00:52:04,476 --> 00:52:07,436 A:middle
it will still have the
streamlined device on its record

1169
00:52:07,736 --> 00:52:09,446 A:middle
in the cloud-- in
the Apple Cloud

1170
00:52:09,446 --> 00:52:12,196 A:middle
and because this device is
required to have this setup,

1171
00:52:12,196 --> 00:52:15,006 A:middle
you can't bypass the setup
assistant and you'll always end

1172
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:15,866 A:middle
up this management
state [applause].

1173
00:52:16,296 --> 00:52:21,886 A:middle
OK, so that's fine and good.

1174
00:52:21,886 --> 00:52:24,216 A:middle
We seem to have lack
of application.

1175
00:52:24,216 --> 00:52:27,236 A:middle
I could spend days just looking
at stocks and playing videos.

1176
00:52:27,616 --> 00:52:29,656 A:middle
But let's see what
apps this user has.

1177
00:52:30,086 --> 00:52:31,756 A:middle
Well, it's an out-of-box system

1178
00:52:31,926 --> 00:52:33,806 A:middle
so I don't have an
Apple ID signed in.

1179
00:52:34,146 --> 00:52:44,326 A:middle
So let me go and sign
up with my ID here.

1180
00:52:44,436 --> 00:52:45,246 A:middle
Oops. Oops.

1181
00:52:45,486 --> 00:52:48,206 A:middle
OK, this is the demo
typing that's happening.

1182
00:52:49,546 --> 00:52:51,746 A:middle
And you would spell that right.

1183
00:52:51,746 --> 00:52:54,166 A:middle
There we go.

1184
00:52:54,416 --> 00:52:57,906 A:middle
And then hopefully,
password is right.

1185
00:52:58,416 --> 00:53:02,826 A:middle
And now log out.

1186
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1187
00:53:03,016 --> 00:53:07,726 A:middle
So we have an Apple ID and
now we have some updates.

1188
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,246 A:middle
Oh sorry, not updates,
applications.

1189
00:53:09,516 --> 00:53:12,076 A:middle
So this user has already
purchased some applications.

1190
00:53:12,696 --> 00:53:14,396 A:middle
So here's my application list.

1191
00:53:14,776 --> 00:53:17,126 A:middle
And these are effective
with the free apps by Apple.

1192
00:53:17,126 --> 00:53:18,996 A:middle
So this user has a free Apple ID

1193
00:53:18,996 --> 00:53:20,686 A:middle
with no credit card
associated with that.

1194
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:22,246 A:middle
That's kind of an anomaly.

1195
00:53:22,406 --> 00:53:24,986 A:middle
Usually people do
buy apps for cash.

1196
00:53:25,306 --> 00:53:27,716 A:middle
But in this case, this
has no CC on file.

1197
00:53:28,096 --> 00:53:31,656 A:middle
So Chris is now going to assign
applications to this device.

1198
00:53:32,026 --> 00:53:35,486 A:middle
So Chris is going to send
a list of applications

1199
00:53:35,536 --> 00:53:38,116 A:middle
that the organization
has licenses for, OK.

1200
00:53:38,896 --> 00:53:39,356 A:middle
Oh I'm sorry.

1201
00:53:39,356 --> 00:53:41,176 A:middle
I'm skipping ahead of myself.

1202
00:53:41,556 --> 00:53:44,346 A:middle
So how do we get this
user into this program?

1203
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,716 A:middle
Yes. We need to invite
that person.

1204
00:53:47,196 --> 00:53:48,236 A:middle
And there are many ways

1205
00:53:48,236 --> 00:53:50,896 A:middle
of getting the user
invited into program.

1206
00:53:50,896 --> 00:53:54,356 A:middle
We can direct the user into a
portal or we can send an email

1207
00:53:54,836 --> 00:53:56,606 A:middle
and we can send a
push notification.

1208
00:53:56,976 --> 00:53:59,706 A:middle
So first I'm going
to show you an email

1209
00:53:59,996 --> 00:54:01,806 A:middle
that the MDM console
is going to send.

1210
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1211
00:54:01,806 --> 00:54:06,046 A:middle
And that'll show up in
the device momentarily.

1212
00:54:06,516 --> 00:54:09,046 A:middle
So here we have an
invitation email

1213
00:54:09,356 --> 00:54:12,336 A:middle
that is basically asking the
user to enroll their Apple ID

1214
00:54:12,776 --> 00:54:14,036 A:middle
with the corporate email.

1215
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:16,356 A:middle
So Apple does not know
what this email address is.

1216
00:54:16,616 --> 00:54:19,856 A:middle
This is only for
the user to know

1217
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:23,096 A:middle
and then the user can
bind their Apple ID

1218
00:54:23,096 --> 00:54:25,386 A:middle
and this corporate email account

1219
00:54:25,386 --> 00:54:26,606 A:middle
and then they can
assign licenses.

1220
00:54:27,016 --> 00:54:32,356 A:middle
But-- and this email is a URL
and that URL can be on a webpage

1221
00:54:32,426 --> 00:54:34,386 A:middle
so depending on how the
MDM vendor would want

1222
00:54:34,386 --> 00:54:35,036 A:middle
to implement this.

1223
00:54:35,256 --> 00:54:38,416 A:middle
As long as they find a way to
display that URL to the user

1224
00:54:38,416 --> 00:54:41,426 A:middle
and have the user click
that, then we're good to go.

1225
00:54:41,716 --> 00:54:43,966 A:middle
So another way to
invite this user is

1226
00:54:43,966 --> 00:54:46,806 A:middle
by sending a push command.

1227
00:54:46,806 --> 00:54:50,706 A:middle
And now we get to log in to
the App Store or we get--

1228
00:54:50,706 --> 00:54:52,176 A:middle
we are brought back
to the App Store.

1229
00:54:52,176 --> 00:54:55,446 A:middle
And we know that OK,
this organization would

1230
00:54:55,446 --> 00:54:57,586 A:middle
like to assign applications
for this ID.

1231
00:54:57,986 --> 00:55:00,586 A:middle
And yes, now we got
three pushes.

1232
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1233
00:55:00,886 --> 00:55:02,906 A:middle
So yes, I will allow apps
to be assigned to this.

1234
00:55:03,816 --> 00:55:08,956 A:middle
And now, we have the user ID
that the email was sent to

1235
00:55:09,196 --> 00:55:11,666 A:middle
and the account that
was associated

1236
00:55:11,696 --> 00:55:13,616 A:middle
with this ID, now
they are linked.

1237
00:55:14,056 --> 00:55:17,036 A:middle
And I've been just sitting here
and what Chris has been doing

1238
00:55:17,036 --> 00:55:19,936 A:middle
as the survey admin, he is
assigned applications to me.

1239
00:55:20,196 --> 00:55:21,956 A:middle
So they just show up
in my purchase list.

1240
00:55:22,306 --> 00:55:23,796 A:middle
So I guess I have
a checklist thing.

1241
00:55:23,796 --> 00:55:25,226 A:middle
I need to know what to do.

1242
00:55:25,226 --> 00:55:28,216 A:middle
I have a things app
I need to learn math.

1243
00:55:28,216 --> 00:55:31,356 A:middle
So these are the licensees
that the company has licensed

1244
00:55:31,356 --> 00:55:32,566 A:middle
and assigned to this user.

1245
00:55:32,626 --> 00:55:34,646 A:middle
And they show up in
my purchase list.

1246
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:38,026 A:middle
But even better way instead

1247
00:55:38,026 --> 00:55:40,156 A:middle
of just having me pull
this application stone,

1248
00:55:40,156 --> 00:55:42,626 A:middle
the administrator
can actually request

1249
00:55:42,626 --> 00:55:44,486 A:middle
that these apps be
installed on this device.

1250
00:55:44,786 --> 00:55:47,606 A:middle
So because this device is
supervised, Chris can now send

1251
00:55:47,606 --> 00:55:49,156 A:middle
and request app install command

1252
00:55:49,156 --> 00:55:52,056 A:middle
and these applications just
start showing up on the device

1253
00:55:52,336 --> 00:55:53,536 A:middle
without me doing anything.

1254
00:55:54,516 --> 00:56:00,096 A:middle
[ Applause ]

1255
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1256
00:56:00,596 --> 00:56:01,726 A:middle
So-- and that is the demo.

1257
00:56:01,726 --> 00:56:02,256 A:middle
Back to Todd.

1258
00:56:02,256 --> 00:56:02,676 A:middle
Thank you.

1259
00:56:03,246 --> 00:56:04,116 A:middle
>> Todd Fernandez: Thank
you very much guys.

1260
00:56:04,896 --> 00:56:09,606 A:middle
All right, well before I sum up,
I just wanted to point something

1261
00:56:09,606 --> 00:56:12,296 A:middle
around what Jussi said
about the ability of the--

1262
00:56:12,296 --> 00:56:14,636 A:middle
even if the user wipes
the device, it's enrolled

1263
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,536 A:middle
in this new service, but
you're still going to have

1264
00:56:16,536 --> 00:56:17,436 A:middle
to go through it each time.

1265
00:56:17,436 --> 00:56:18,456 A:middle
You can't get around it.

1266
00:56:18,836 --> 00:56:21,256 A:middle
This actually makes for a
great experience in schools

1267
00:56:21,256 --> 00:56:23,926 A:middle
if a student graduates and
returns the device in school,

1268
00:56:24,026 --> 00:56:26,146 A:middle
all they need to do to prevent--
prepare it for the next student

1269
00:56:26,146 --> 00:56:28,986 A:middle
for the next year is wipe it
and hand it to the new student.

1270
00:56:29,776 --> 00:56:32,646 A:middle
All right, so what have we--
what have we talked about today?

1271
00:56:32,886 --> 00:56:35,596 A:middle
Well, we've added a huge
number of new capabilities

1272
00:56:35,596 --> 00:56:38,446 A:middle
to configuration profiles and
MDM protocol for all of you

1273
00:56:38,446 --> 00:56:41,286 A:middle
to adopt in your MDM solutions.

1274
00:56:42,006 --> 00:56:43,566 A:middle
We've made big changes

1275
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,176 A:middle
to the App Store
Volume Purchased Program

1276
00:56:45,176 --> 00:56:48,266 A:middle
to add revocable app assignments
as well as book assignments.

1277
00:56:48,886 --> 00:56:52,406 A:middle
We've created a brand new
service that you just saw

1278
00:56:52,646 --> 00:56:55,706 A:middle
to make it really easy for both
organizations and end users

1279
00:56:55,706 --> 00:56:58,696 A:middle
to get their devices enrolled,
remote device management.

1280
00:56:59,626 --> 00:57:02,396 A:middle
And I'm really looking forward
to working together with all

1281
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1282
00:57:02,396 --> 00:57:04,716 A:middle
of you to get these
systems integrated

1283
00:57:04,716 --> 00:57:07,506 A:middle
into your MDM products so that
we can make managing large

1284
00:57:07,506 --> 00:57:09,186 A:middle
numbers of Apple
devices a pleasure

1285
00:57:09,186 --> 00:57:12,006 A:middle
for both the organization
and each of their end users.

1286
00:57:12,556 --> 00:57:14,786 A:middle
Now I hope the next question
in your mind is, Todd,

1287
00:57:14,786 --> 00:57:15,916 A:middle
when can we get started?

1288
00:57:16,826 --> 00:57:19,346 A:middle
Well, I have some good
news, the documentation

1289
00:57:19,346 --> 00:57:20,666 A:middle
which includes details on how

1290
00:57:20,666 --> 00:57:23,456 A:middle
to obtain your VPP Test
Accounts is available today.

1291
00:57:24,856 --> 00:57:27,166 A:middle
And the device enrollment
accounts will be ready

1292
00:57:27,276 --> 00:57:28,426 A:middle
next month.

1293
00:57:29,336 --> 00:57:31,686 A:middle
So with that, I will leave
you with the pointers

1294
00:57:31,686 --> 00:57:35,206 A:middle
to that documentation for
both the updated MDM protocol

1295
00:57:35,206 --> 00:57:38,146 A:middle
that covers both the new App
Store Volume Purchase Program

1296
00:57:38,146 --> 00:57:39,796 A:middle
as well as device
enrollment service,

1297
00:57:40,656 --> 00:57:42,586 A:middle
an updated configuration
profile reference

1298
00:57:42,586 --> 00:57:44,246 A:middle
that contains all
the new payloads

1299
00:57:44,246 --> 00:57:47,426 A:middle
and changes we've talked in the
first section and the new forum

1300
00:57:47,426 --> 00:57:50,066 A:middle
that you will hopefully
join to begin discussing how

1301
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:51,966 A:middle
to integrate these best
into your products.

1302
00:57:53,086 --> 00:57:54,986 A:middle
As we've alluded during the
session, there are a number

1303
00:57:54,986 --> 00:57:57,166 A:middle
of sessions that will be
interest to app developers

1304
00:57:57,166 --> 00:57:59,896 A:middle
in particular who want to learn
more about how to take advantage

1305
00:57:59,896 --> 00:58:03,276 A:middle
of these new management
features in their apps including

1306
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1307
00:58:03,276 --> 00:58:05,606 A:middle
that receipt session I
promised on Thursday afternoon.

1308
00:58:06,046 --> 00:58:08,046 A:middle
And with that, I will thank you
very much for your attention

1309
00:58:08,046 --> 00:58:09,406 A:middle
and look forward to
seeing you in the lab.

1310
00:58:09,406 --> 00:58:11,016 A:middle
[Applause]

1311
00:58:11,016 --> 00:58:15,866 A:middle
