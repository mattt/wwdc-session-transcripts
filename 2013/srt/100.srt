with the few updates
beginning with Apple retail.

00:03:53,446 --> 00:03:56,616 A:middle
Of course, our retail stores
are the best place to discover

47

and explore our products,

48
00:03:58,896 --> 00:04:03,306 A:middle

Our stores are filled with
our colleagues who work

52
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:10,856 A:middle
at our stores because
they're passionate

53
00:04:11,146 --> 00:04:14,696 A:middle
about how Apple technology
can enrich people's lives.

54
00:04:15,106 --> 00:04:16,896 A:middle
Our stores had become
integral parts

55
00:04:16,896 --> 00:04:18,586 A:middle
of the communities
that they serve.

56
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:23,376 A:middle
Tens of thousands of school kids
pick their local Apple Store

57
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:26,136 A:middle
as the destination for
their annual field trip.

58
00:04:27,256 --> 00:04:30,536 A:middle
And millions of customers
come to our stores

59
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,486 A:middle

they can learn to get the most

beautiful store in Berlin.

65
00:04:50,296 --> 00:04:52,876 A:middle
It's in a 100 year old building.

00:04:53,346 --> 00:04:57,206 A:middle
It was originally one of the
first theaters in Berlin.

and added some classic
Apple touches along the way.

the building but separate

72
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:16,226 A:middle
from the store, and we'll be
hosting many events throughout

from music to films and more.

second, they're running logic

169
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,896 A:middle
to sense a track, their position
on it, adjusting their steering

170
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:48,936 A:middle
and speed and communicating
back and forth

171
00:11:48,936 --> 00:11:50,216 A:middle
with our AI engine
on that iPhone.

172
00:11:51,236 --> 00:11:53,496 A:middle
I'll let Aidan join his friends
and tell him to hit the gas.

So, as Aiden weaves
through the pack,

178
00:12:05,636 --> 00:12:08,026 A:middle
our app knows everything
that's happening in real time.

179
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:09,676 A:middle
It's analyzing thousands

180
00:12:09,676 --> 00:12:11,946 A:middle
of potential actions
every single second.

181
00:12:12,436 --> 00:12:14,416 A:middle
And not just for Aiden
but for every single car.

182
00:12:15,086 --> 00:12:17,846 A:middle
We are using iOS devices
not just as remote controls

183

but as the brains behind an
immersive real world experience.

184
00:12:21,906 --> 00:12:24,226 A:middle
And that is what lets this
bring these cars to life.

185
00:12:25,386 --> 00:12:26,646 A:middle
Now let's do something
interesting here.

00:12:27,056 --> 00:12:29,196 A:middle
Brad. He's going to
tell these other cars

187
00:12:29,196 --> 00:12:30,296 A:middle
to try to block Aiden.

188
00:12:30,776 --> 00:12:32,816 A:middle
And just to be clear, none
of this is choreographed.

189
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:35,436 A:middle
All we're doing is defining
a new objective for each car

190
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:36,776 A:middle
and they'd figure out the rest.

191
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:41,016 A:middle
Here, Aiden, he's using the
exact same logic he was using

192
00:12:41,016 --> 00:12:43,616 A:middle
before, sensing where he is
and reacting to the other cars

193
00:12:43,616 --> 00:12:44,606 A:middle
as he looks for an opening.

194
00:12:45,216 --> 00:12:46,896 A:middle

195
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:50,746 A:middle

This is double what it
was just five years ago.

246
00:15:04,566 --> 00:15:08,476 A:middle
We announced the new iMac at
the end of last year and it went

247
00:15:08,476 --> 00:15:11,166 A:middle
on to become the number
one desktop in the US.

248
00:15:12,136 --> 00:15:16,066 A:middle
And the MacBook has
continued to define the future

249
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:19,516 A:middle
of the notebook and is the
number one notebook in the US.

250
00:15:20,716 --> 00:15:24,006 A:middle
In fact, the Mac business
has outpaced the PC business

251
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,646 A:middle
for several years now.

252
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,106 A:middle

of our big cat-named releases
in just over a decade.

As we turn our attention
now toward the 10th,

290
00:17:29,836 --> 00:17:30,736 A:middle
we've hit a real issue.

291
00:17:31,686 --> 00:17:37,346 A:middle
We do not want to be the
first software in history

Now, fortunately, we do have
a creative group at Apple

and we can think out of the box.

we could take this lion thing

00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:50,636 A:middle
You can actually drag
contents and hover across tabs.

333
00:19:51,076 --> 00:19:53,126 A:middle
And of course, now that we
have Tabs in the Finder,

334
00:19:53,356 --> 00:19:56,066 A:middle
it's also a great app
to take full screen.

335
00:19:57,016 --> 00:19:59,386 A:middle
Next, Tagging.

336
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

337
00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:00,336 A:middle
>> Yes.

338
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:01,426 A:middle
>> Yes.

339
00:20:03,706 --> 00:20:07,776 A:middle
That guy. We're bringing
tagging to the Mac.

340
00:20:08,026 --> 00:20:10,346 A:middle
So now, when you
save a document,

341
00:20:10,546 --> 00:20:12,906 A:middle
in addition to providing
its location

342
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:14,676 A:middle
and name, you can tag it.

343
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:17,786 A:middle
And when you do, it will appear
right in the Finder sidebar.

344
00:20:17,786 --> 00:20:21,486 A:middle
And in fact, you can tag
things wherever they are,

345
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,906 A:middle
whether they're in iCloud
or on a local file share,

346
00:20:23,906 --> 00:20:27,906 A:middle
and all those will be brought
together and appear in Finder.

347
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:32,936 A:middle
And, tags are great for really
powerful search as well.

348
00:20:33,956 --> 00:20:35,336 A:middle
Next-- yeah.

349
00:20:36,006 --> 00:20:37,716 A:middle
Next, Multiple Displays.

350
00:20:37,926 --> 00:20:38,206 A:middle
Really, all right.

351
00:20:38,206 --> 00:20:48,426 A:middle
The Mac-- of course, we're not
giving you all the free multiple

352
00:20:48,426 --> 00:20:49,036 A:middle
display here.

353
00:20:49,106 --> 00:20:50,636 A:middle
This is software.

354
00:20:51,096 --> 00:20:54,796 A:middle
So, with multiple
displays in the Mac,

355
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:57,186 A:middle
it's always been a powerful
way to spread out your work.

356
00:20:57,186 --> 00:21:01,146 A:middle
But now, in Mavericks,
you can get at your menus

357
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

358
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,956 A:middle
across multiple displays.

359
00:21:03,246 --> 00:21:06,686 A:middle
You can summon your DOC
across multiple displays.

360
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,156 A:middle
And when you take a window
full screen on one display,

361
00:21:09,156 --> 00:21:11,156 A:middle
it doesn't mess with your
desktop on the other display.

362
00:21:12,516 --> 00:21:18,836 A:middle
[ Applause ]

363
00:21:19,336 --> 00:21:20,276 A:middle
And I really love this.

364
00:21:20,276 --> 00:21:23,246 A:middle
When you pan your spaces,
you can do it independently

365
00:21:23,246 --> 00:21:24,576 A:middle
on each of your displays.

366
00:21:25,516 --> 00:21:27,556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

367
00:21:28,056 --> 00:21:33,526 A:middle
Finally, if you have an
AirPlay-connected HDTV,

368
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:37,736 A:middle
it acts as a full power
separate display as well and I'd

369
00:21:37,736 --> 00:21:39,626 A:middle
like to show all of
these to you now.

370
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:44,776 A:middle
[ Applause ]

371
00:21:45,276 --> 00:21:47,996 A:middle
All right, let's take our
first look here at Mavericks

372
00:21:47,996 --> 00:21:50,236 A:middle
and we're going to
start with the Finder.

373
00:21:51,856 --> 00:21:54,626 A:middle
So, here's Finder environment,
I got a lot going on,

374
00:21:54,626 --> 00:21:56,846 A:middle
a lot of windows, a lot
of different locations.

375
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,856 A:middle
I'm going to go up
here to the Window Menu

376
00:21:58,856 --> 00:22:00,316 A:middle
and let's merge all my windows.

377
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

378
00:22:00,316 --> 00:22:03,966 A:middle
Just like that, they
hop into a set of tabs.

379
00:22:05,316 --> 00:22:07,936 A:middle
Now, of course, these tabs
at different locations,

380
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:10,686 A:middle
different view settings for
each to those locations.

381
00:22:11,346 --> 00:22:13,466 A:middle
Creating a tab is
just as you'd expect.

382
00:22:13,576 --> 00:22:14,486 A:middle
Just click Plus.

383
00:22:14,486 --> 00:22:18,056 A:middle
I can select another location
like AirDrop, may be another

384
00:22:18,056 --> 00:22:20,306 A:middle
for this Work File Share.

385
00:22:20,396 --> 00:22:21,426 A:middle
I'm going right here.

386
00:22:21,706 --> 00:22:25,446 A:middle
And now that I have multiple
tabs, it's a really great way

387
00:22:25,446 --> 00:22:27,136 A:middle
to actually work
and copy documents.

388
00:22:27,136 --> 00:22:29,346 A:middle
If I want to copy this field
report, I can just hover

389
00:22:29,646 --> 00:22:34,366 A:middle
over the AirDrop tab, drop it
just like that, really nice.

390
00:22:35,006 --> 00:22:40,526 A:middle
And, of course, I can now
take Finder full screen.

391
00:22:41,636 --> 00:22:43,776 A:middle
Next, let's take
a look at tagging.

392
00:22:43,976 --> 00:22:44,906 A:middle
This is really cool.

393
00:22:45,036 --> 00:22:46,716 A:middle
So as I go to save a document,

394
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:50,136 A:middle
you know as I can give it a name
like, let's say, Project Plan.

395
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,486 A:middle
And in addition to its
location, in this case,

396
00:22:52,486 --> 00:22:55,036 A:middle
I'm going to save it in
iCloud, I can also give it a tag

397
00:22:55,036 --> 00:22:56,326 A:middle
from any of the tags
I've made up.

398
00:22:56,326 --> 00:22:59,066 A:middle
So I'm going to call
this document Important.

399
00:22:59,136 --> 00:23:00,296 A:middle
Looks pretty important to me.

400
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

401
00:23:00,706 --> 00:23:04,196 A:middle
And we'll go here into
the Finder and you see

402
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:06,676 A:middle
in the Finder sidebar,
I have an Important tag

403
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,026 A:middle
and I see all these documents.

404
00:23:08,026 --> 00:23:09,216 A:middle
They're from different
locations,

405
00:23:09,216 --> 00:23:12,596 A:middle
different applications, all
drawn together in sidebar.

406
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:14,046 A:middle
We have other tags.

407
00:23:14,046 --> 00:23:16,836 A:middle
I've given things for things
that are draft and in review.

408
00:23:16,936 --> 00:23:18,146 A:middle
Now, of course with tags,

409
00:23:18,226 --> 00:23:20,666 A:middle
I can assign multiple
tags to the same document.

410
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:21,936 A:middle
That's part of the
power of tags.

411
00:23:22,296 --> 00:23:25,256 A:middle
So I go here and I'm going to
say this one is also in review.

412
00:23:25,256 --> 00:23:27,966 A:middle
And you notice, as I sign
that tag, it now appears

413
00:23:27,966 --> 00:23:29,336 A:middle
in that location as well.

414
00:23:29,336 --> 00:23:33,046 A:middle
And if I want to assign a
totally new tag, I want to make

415
00:23:33,046 --> 00:23:35,506 A:middle
up a tag on the fly, you
can just type it right here.

416
00:23:35,506 --> 00:23:37,256 A:middle
This is a website
project I'm working on.

417
00:23:37,256 --> 00:23:39,026 A:middle
It's says Create
New Tag Website.

418
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:42,106 A:middle
And just like that,
I've created a new tag

419
00:23:42,106 --> 00:23:44,846 A:middle
and you can see it right
here in the Finder.

420
00:23:45,456 --> 00:23:47,716 A:middle
I can give that tag
a color of course.

421
00:23:48,466 --> 00:23:51,606 A:middle
And now that I have that
tag, I can also assign tags

422
00:23:51,606 --> 00:23:54,836 A:middle
by just dragging things in
to the Tagger and the Finder.

423
00:23:55,026 --> 00:23:58,526 A:middle
So different assets from my
website, just drag them in

424
00:23:58,526 --> 00:24:00,076 A:middle
and they're tagged like that.

425
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

426
00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:02,806 A:middle
And tags are great
for searching.

427
00:24:03,286 --> 00:24:05,486 A:middle
So if I start typing,
let's say, Important,

428
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:08,126 A:middle
it can find all documents
that are important.

429
00:24:08,216 --> 00:24:10,476 A:middle
Let's go to All My Files,
we'll find all documents,

430
00:24:10,476 --> 00:24:14,416 A:middle
they're both important
and that are in review.

431
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:18,506 A:middle
Just like that, I found exactly
what I'm looking for with tags.

432
00:24:19,516 --> 00:24:24,826 A:middle
[ Applause ]

433
00:24:25,326 --> 00:24:27,476 A:middle
Next, let's take a look
at Multiple Displays.

434
00:24:27,476 --> 00:24:29,676 A:middle
I'm going to open up some
other kind of windows

435
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,136 A:middle
that I'm often working with.

436
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:35,086 A:middle
We'll open iPhoto here, may
be a keynote presentation.

437
00:24:35,216 --> 00:24:37,426 A:middle
And I actually have a
second display connected

438
00:24:37,426 --> 00:24:38,446 A:middle
to this MacBook Pro.

439
00:24:38,446 --> 00:24:40,726 A:middle
Let's show that up
there on display now.

440
00:24:40,726 --> 00:24:42,576 A:middle
Of course with multiple
displays,

441
00:24:42,576 --> 00:24:46,456 A:middle
I can just move windows across
displays like you'd expect.

442
00:24:47,046 --> 00:24:50,306 A:middle
But now, I can get up at my
Menu bar in the second display.

443
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:51,646 A:middle
If I go down to the bottom,

444
00:24:51,646 --> 00:24:54,136 A:middle
I can summon the
DOC just like that.

445
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:57,226 A:middle
If I want to open an app on the
second display, I can just open

446
00:24:57,226 --> 00:24:59,826 A:middle
that on the DOC here
and here is iTunes.

447
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

448
00:25:00,386 --> 00:25:03,436 A:middle
Take this app full
screen just like that.

449
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:06,876 A:middle
And as I swipe spaces,
just right back there.

450
00:25:06,876 --> 00:25:09,836 A:middle
Just on that display, let's take
a keynote full screen as well.

451
00:25:09,836 --> 00:25:13,236 A:middle
I'm going to go back to
my first display here.

452
00:25:13,236 --> 00:25:15,956 A:middle
Let's even take iPhoto
full screen.

453
00:25:15,956 --> 00:25:17,546 A:middle
So now, I have different
full screen apps

454
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:18,696 A:middle
on my different displays.

455
00:25:18,696 --> 00:25:20,316 A:middle
This is actually really
fantastic way to work.

456
00:25:20,856 --> 00:25:23,996 A:middle
Go in here into Favorite Travels
and I can now drag assets

457
00:25:23,996 --> 00:25:27,896 A:middle
across my full screen apps
like that, super cool.

458
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:30,996 A:middle
And, Mission Control has
just been super charged

459
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:31,916 A:middle
for multiple displays.

460
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:34,586 A:middle
So, I'm going to go now
into Mission Control

461
00:25:35,216 --> 00:25:37,626 A:middle
and we see my different
full screen spaces

462
00:25:37,886 --> 00:25:40,706 A:middle
and desktops across
applications.

463
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,266 A:middle
I can drag a window from
one display to another.

464
00:25:43,266 --> 00:25:47,156 A:middle
I can also go and drag
a full screen app right

465
00:25:47,156 --> 00:25:50,266 A:middle
across displays, bring
Preview open, and now I have

466
00:25:50,266 --> 00:25:52,376 A:middle
that full screen on
this display as well.

[ Applause ]

468
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:02,366 A:middle
Finally, I actually have
an Apple TV around here.

470
00:26:02,366 --> 00:26:03,486 A:middle
Let's bring that into place.

471
00:26:03,486 --> 00:26:05,196 A:middle
So here's my Apple TV.

472
00:26:05,486 --> 00:26:08,046 A:middle
Now, this is pretty
over the top.

473
00:26:08,046 --> 00:26:11,816 A:middle
So I can actually go
here into AirPlay.

474
00:26:11,816 --> 00:26:13,856 A:middle
I'm going to connect
to this Apple TV.

475
00:26:14,846 --> 00:26:18,856 A:middle
So now, it's a full
power display as well.

476
00:26:18,856 --> 00:26:21,616 A:middle
You can see I have my
Menu bar and my DOC.

477
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:25,096 A:middle
I can go over here
and get my DOC here.

478
00:26:25,716 --> 00:26:28,806 A:middle
And, I can go into
Mission Control, even,

479
00:26:28,946 --> 00:26:33,046 A:middle
and I can go get a window
across that other display.

480
00:26:34,476 --> 00:26:35,886 A:middle
We'll just drag Keynote
over here,

481
00:26:36,656 --> 00:26:40,186 A:middle
right on to my Apple
TV, and open it up.

482
00:26:40,526 --> 00:26:42,916 A:middle
There it is, full
displays in Mavericks.

[ Applause ]

484
00:26:49,246 --> 00:26:50,826 A:middle
Next, I'd like to talk

485
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:54,406 A:middle
about some advanced
technologies in Mavericks.

486
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:58,476 A:middle
You know, our power users are
increasingly doing their work

487
00:26:58,476 --> 00:26:59,276 A:middle
on the go.

488
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,726 A:middle
They want great responsiveness

489
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

490
00:27:00,976 --> 00:27:03,226 A:middle
but they also want
great battery life.

491
00:27:03,806 --> 00:27:06,626 A:middle
And in Mavericks, we've
introduced a whole host

492
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:09,146 A:middle
of technologies to
address that challenge.

493
00:27:09,536 --> 00:27:11,086 A:middle
Things like Compressed Memory

494
00:27:11,086 --> 00:27:13,716 A:middle
that make sure you have
memory available very quickly

495
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:14,816 A:middle
when apps demand it.

496
00:27:15,336 --> 00:27:16,766 A:middle
Technologies like App Nap

497
00:27:17,186 --> 00:27:19,436 A:middle
that actually makes sure
we're directing power only

498
00:27:19,436 --> 00:27:20,456 A:middle
to those applications

499
00:27:20,596 --> 00:27:22,086 A:middle
where you're really
benefiting from it.

500
00:27:22,756 --> 00:27:25,656 A:middle
System-wide Core Animation
Accelerated Scrolling

501
00:27:25,656 --> 00:27:28,936 A:middle
and OpenGL 4 for super
responsive graphics.

502
00:27:29,516 --> 00:27:30,966 A:middle
And, a topic I want to go

503
00:27:30,966 --> 00:27:33,966 A:middle
into in a bit more detail
now, Timer Coalescing.

504
00:27:34,616 --> 00:27:38,446 A:middle
So you know, when you look at
battery life on your computer,

505
00:27:39,086 --> 00:27:41,316 A:middle
the real factor that software
has the most influence

506
00:27:41,316 --> 00:27:44,596 A:middle
over is CPU activity
and its draw on power.

507
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,736 A:middle
And if you look at what
your system is doing

508
00:27:46,736 --> 00:27:50,466 A:middle
at any given time, what
you'll see as you look

509
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:53,876 A:middle
under the hood is not a smooth
line, but actually hundreds

510
00:27:53,876 --> 00:27:56,396 A:middle
of interrupts occurring per
second where the system is going

511
00:27:56,396 --> 00:27:59,366 A:middle
from a power-efficient
sleep state up to a state

512
00:27:59,366 --> 00:28:01,446 A:middle
of high power use and back down.

513
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

514
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:05,326 A:middle
And all of those transitions
actually consume a lot of power.

515
00:28:05,856 --> 00:28:09,396 A:middle
Well in Mavericks, we
intelligently align all

516
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:12,076 A:middle
of that work, reducing those
numbers of transitions.

517
00:28:12,496 --> 00:28:15,506 A:middle
This, in combination with
technologies like App Nap

518
00:28:15,776 --> 00:28:20,476 A:middle
and other power optimizations,
reduce CPU utilization activity

519
00:28:20,476 --> 00:28:23,666 A:middle
for these kinds of
scenarios up to 72 percent.

520
00:28:24,176 --> 00:28:24,976 A:middle
It's pretty awesome.

521
00:28:25,516 --> 00:28:31,666 A:middle
[ Applause ]

522
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:34,076 A:middle
Next, let's talk about
Compressed Memory.

523
00:28:34,876 --> 00:28:37,256 A:middle
Nothing affects the
performance of your Mac,

524
00:28:37,336 --> 00:28:39,406 A:middle
the responsiveness more of
a Mac, that's under load

525
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,466 A:middle
than its ability to provide
free memory to an app.

526
00:28:43,086 --> 00:28:45,146 A:middle
Now, typically, when you
look at your app runtime,

527
00:28:45,546 --> 00:28:46,836 A:middle
all your memory is inactive.

528
00:28:46,836 --> 00:28:49,726 A:middle
In fact, a subset of your
memory is actively being used

529
00:28:50,116 --> 00:28:52,156 A:middle
and others is memory
we have to keep around

530
00:28:52,326 --> 00:28:53,806 A:middle
but isn't being used by the app.

531
00:28:54,206 --> 00:28:57,956 A:middle
Well, now if you open a
document, your system is going

532
00:28:57,956 --> 00:29:00,926 A:middle
to need to get free memory
and it does that in the past

533
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

534
00:29:01,126 --> 00:29:03,866 A:middle
by writing those inactive
bits of memory out to disk,

535
00:29:03,866 --> 00:29:05,106 A:middle
and that's a slow process.

536
00:29:05,826 --> 00:29:07,956 A:middle
Now, with Compressed Memory,

537
00:29:08,076 --> 00:29:11,526 A:middle
we're able to rapidly compress
the inactive memory making free

538
00:29:11,526 --> 00:29:13,786 A:middle
space available almost
instantaneously

539
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:14,636 A:middle
to the application.

540
00:29:15,376 --> 00:29:17,856 A:middle
This can have great
effects on responsiveness

541
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:18,876 A:middle
of systems under load.

542
00:29:19,296 --> 00:29:21,886 A:middle
You see, 1.4X kinds
of improvements,

543
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:24,596 A:middle
even on fast SSD
systems for activities

544
00:29:24,736 --> 00:29:27,616 A:middle
like opening new documents
or reactivate an application,

545
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:32,086 A:middle
and up to 1.5X improvement for
waking a system from standby,

546
00:29:32,886 --> 00:29:36,386 A:middle
these are just two of
many improvements to power

547
00:29:36,386 --> 00:29:38,106 A:middle
and performance in Mavericks.

548
00:29:38,816 --> 00:29:40,716 A:middle
Next, let's talk about Safari.

549
00:29:41,426 --> 00:29:46,816 A:middle
In the last decade of life,
Safari is focused not just

550
00:29:46,906 --> 00:29:48,336 A:middle
on providing the easiest to use

551
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:50,226 A:middle
and most elegant
browsing experience,

552
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:52,486 A:middle
but also the most innovative.

553
00:29:53,896 --> 00:29:55,616 A:middle
These are the kinds
of innovations

554
00:29:55,866 --> 00:29:58,236 A:middle
that Safari has brought,
private browsing,

555
00:29:58,556 --> 00:30:00,896 A:middle
blocking of third party
cookies for privacy,

556
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

557
00:30:01,256 --> 00:30:03,656 A:middle
making the web easier to read
with features like Reading List,

558
00:30:03,746 --> 00:30:08,186 A:middle
and the HTML5 audio and
video tag, all Safari-firsts.

559
00:30:08,636 --> 00:30:10,326 A:middle
And the engine in
Safari, WebKit,

560
00:30:10,326 --> 00:30:14,246 A:middle
is used by over 1.5
billion devices.

561
00:30:15,156 --> 00:30:18,456 A:middle
Well in Mountain Lion, we're
making Safari even better.

562
00:30:19,126 --> 00:30:22,236 A:middle
We have a great clean new
homepage with top sites.

563
00:30:22,596 --> 00:30:27,066 A:middle
From there, you can get at great
sidebar where you have access

564
00:30:27,066 --> 00:30:29,916 A:middle
to all of your bookmarks
and you can browse right

565
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:30,856 A:middle
from your bookmarks.

566
00:30:31,486 --> 00:30:34,726 A:middle
And in that sidebar, we
also have Reading List

567
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:37,216 A:middle
where now you can
continuously scroll

568
00:30:37,216 --> 00:30:39,776 A:middle
through your articles moving
from article to article

569
00:30:39,776 --> 00:30:40,886 A:middle
without ever having to click.

570
00:30:41,656 --> 00:30:46,556 A:middle
And a great new feature called
Shared Links where you see all

571
00:30:46,556 --> 00:30:48,566 A:middle
of the links shared by
people you're following

572
00:30:48,566 --> 00:30:49,806 A:middle
on Twitter and LinkedIn.

573
00:30:49,946 --> 00:30:51,196 A:middle
You can browse them right here.

574
00:30:52,126 --> 00:30:55,966 A:middle
Now in addition to these
end-user improvements,

575
00:30:56,116 --> 00:30:59,776 A:middle
there's also a lot going on
under the hood, big improvements

576
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:03,286 A:middle
to JavaScript, a full
process-per-tab architecture,

577
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

578
00:31:03,286 --> 00:31:05,066 A:middle
and memory efficiency
improvements

579
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:08,396 A:middle
with the shared memory resource
cache, and a whole bunch

580
00:31:08,426 --> 00:31:10,476 A:middle
of big power savings as well.

581
00:31:11,016 --> 00:31:11,846 A:middle
When you look at the effects

582
00:31:11,846 --> 00:31:13,466 A:middle
of these changes,
it's pretty profound.

583
00:31:14,066 --> 00:31:16,906 A:middle
If you take a synthetic
benchmark like SunSpider,

584
00:31:17,396 --> 00:31:20,276 A:middle
you see how Safari fairs
against the competition.

585
00:31:20,996 --> 00:31:22,576 A:middle
But, you know, researchers
have started to look

586
00:31:22,576 --> 00:31:26,626 A:middle
at more real world JavaScript
by sampling the JavaScript

587
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:27,876 A:middle
that actually occurs on sites

588
00:31:27,876 --> 00:31:31,226 A:middle
like the Google homepage,
Facebook, Amazon.com.

589
00:31:31,736 --> 00:31:33,996 A:middle
And when you look at Safari's
performance on a benchmark

590
00:31:33,996 --> 00:31:38,196 A:middle
like that, JSBench, the
results are really incredible.

591
00:31:39,516 --> 00:31:45,196 A:middle
[ Applause ]

592
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:49,376 A:middle
Safari is also awesome when
it comes now to memory usage,

593
00:31:49,706 --> 00:31:51,856 A:middle
using way less memory
than the other browsers

594
00:31:51,856 --> 00:31:54,456 A:middle
which means more memory for
you to browse with more tabs

595
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:55,766 A:middle
and do more on your system.

596
00:31:56,266 --> 00:31:59,536 A:middle
And when it comes to energy
use, it's not even closed.

597
00:31:59,826 --> 00:32:03,026 A:middle
Safari uses way less
energy than Chrome.

598
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

599
00:32:03,076 --> 00:32:05,986 A:middle
And when you compare to
Firefox, it's just kind of sad.

600
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:08,296 A:middle
So that's Safari.

601
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:10,546 A:middle
I'd love to give
you a demo of some

602
00:32:10,546 --> 00:32:12,756 A:middle
of our advanced technologies
in Safari right now.

603
00:32:19,246 --> 00:32:21,966 A:middle
So, let's start with
responsiveness

604
00:32:21,966 --> 00:32:24,106 A:middle
and I'm going to
go now into mail.

605
00:32:24,106 --> 00:32:28,466 A:middle
And so here, we have a mailbox
with about 100,000 messages

606
00:32:28,466 --> 00:32:33,306 A:middle
in your inbox and I just want
to show you how you scroll now

607
00:32:33,306 --> 00:32:34,566 A:middle
with that accelerated scrolling.

608
00:32:35,026 --> 00:32:37,846 A:middle
Perfectly smooth,
incredibly fast,

609
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:40,936 A:middle
almost 60 frames a
second whenever you do it,

610
00:32:40,936 --> 00:32:41,986 A:middle
it's just epic.

611
00:32:41,986 --> 00:32:44,976 A:middle
And when you look
here at scrolling

612
00:32:44,976 --> 00:32:47,416 A:middle
through a conversation,
this is a conversation

613
00:32:47,416 --> 00:32:48,936 A:middle
with 26 messages in it.

614
00:32:49,606 --> 00:32:54,216 A:middle
Again, just super glassy
smooth, super fast,

615
00:32:54,386 --> 00:32:55,696 A:middle
it's really, really nice.

616
00:32:56,106 --> 00:32:57,726 A:middle
Let's take a look
at that in Safari.

617
00:32:58,096 --> 00:33:00,466 A:middle
In Safari, we've
improved scrolling

618
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

619
00:33:00,506 --> 00:33:04,086 A:middle
for more popular websites and
actually optimized heavily

620
00:33:04,086 --> 00:33:08,946 A:middle
for retina displays so now, it's
just super fast, super smooth.

621
00:33:09,626 --> 00:33:10,956 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at power.

622
00:33:11,076 --> 00:33:13,286 A:middle
Yeah, there's a fan of
smooth scrolling right there

623
00:33:13,286 --> 00:33:13,736 A:middle
in the front.

624
00:33:16,486 --> 00:33:18,296 A:middle
I'm a fan of smooth
scrolling as well.

625
00:33:18,616 --> 00:33:21,046 A:middle
So let's take a look at power
use, so you have a power meter

626
00:33:21,046 --> 00:33:23,196 A:middle
up here that's showing
CPU activity in Safari

627
00:33:23,196 --> 00:33:25,306 A:middle
and you notice right
now, it's quite low

628
00:33:25,726 --> 00:33:26,726 A:middle
because we're not
doing anything.

629
00:33:26,936 --> 00:33:30,356 A:middle
But let's go into a website
that's going to use a lot

630
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:32,626 A:middle
of power and you notice
the power meter shoot right

631
00:33:32,626 --> 00:33:35,646 A:middle
up because we're doing a lot of
animation here using all the CPU

632
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,286 A:middle
and that's OK, that's
what the CPUs for,

633
00:33:37,286 --> 00:33:38,846 A:middle
it's doing something
cool for me right here.

634
00:33:38,846 --> 00:33:41,286 A:middle
But very often, you'll have
something like this happening

635
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:43,996 A:middle
in an add off in the corner,
you've covered this window up

636
00:33:43,996 --> 00:33:46,206 A:middle
and yet, it's still
draining your battery life,

637
00:33:46,386 --> 00:33:47,366 A:middle
you don't even realized it.

638
00:33:47,886 --> 00:33:51,586 A:middle
Well now, with this technology
we call AppNap, we keep track

639
00:33:51,586 --> 00:33:54,116 A:middle
of what's going on and what
things you actually to see

640
00:33:54,386 --> 00:33:55,726 A:middle
to decide where to direct power.

641
00:33:56,186 --> 00:33:59,886 A:middle
So watch what happens when I
bring up this iTunes window

642
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

643
00:34:00,176 --> 00:34:02,326 A:middle
over the Safari window,
the power drops right down

644
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:10,766 A:middle
and that's extending
your battery life.

645
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:16,396 A:middle
But of course, that
thing is still running,

646
00:34:16,396 --> 00:34:19,726 A:middle
it's still available to me so if
I pull it aside, there it goes,

647
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:21,386 A:middle
you can see everything
happening right now.

648
00:34:21,386 --> 00:34:25,196 A:middle
The power goes up, cover back
up, power goes right back down,

649
00:34:25,326 --> 00:34:30,795 A:middle
it's really going to
help your battery life.

650
00:34:31,326 --> 00:34:35,346 A:middle
Next, let's take a look at
the new Safari top sites.

651
00:34:36,295 --> 00:34:37,856 A:middle
Really clean, really nice.

652
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:39,246 A:middle
We'll bring out the new sidebar.

653
00:34:39,386 --> 00:34:40,946 A:middle
You see I have all

654
00:34:41,306 --> 00:34:43,456 A:middle
I have my bookmark
folders as well.

655
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:46,366 A:middle
If I want to bring a side
over for my bookmarks

656
00:34:46,366 --> 00:34:48,576 A:middle
in the top sites, I can
just drag it out like this.

657
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:49,525 A:middle
It's really nice.

658
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:52,186 A:middle
I can open it up, animates in.

659
00:34:52,536 --> 00:34:57,796 A:middle
From the side bar, we also have
access to our shared links.

660
00:34:57,796 --> 00:35:01,216 A:middle
You see sites that I'm following
here on Twitter and LinkedIn

662
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:03,996 A:middle
and click on a site-- a
link that's been shared.

663
00:35:03,996 --> 00:35:07,686 A:middle
It loads it up, I can
even retweet it right here

664
00:35:07,686 --> 00:35:08,646 A:middle
if I-- if I wish.

665
00:35:08,826 --> 00:35:10,626 A:middle
And we now have one-click
bookmarking

666
00:35:10,626 --> 00:35:12,446 A:middle
so I'll just click this plus
and it's going to hop right

667
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:14,276 A:middle
in to my Reading
List right there.

668
00:35:14,276 --> 00:35:16,186 A:middle
Let's go take a look
at my Reading List.

669
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,826 A:middle
See all the articles I've
added here to my Reading List?

670
00:35:19,966 --> 00:35:22,596 A:middle
I want you to watch how
scrolling works because now,

671
00:35:23,156 --> 00:35:25,166 A:middle
when I scroll and I'm
reading through one article,

672
00:35:25,196 --> 00:35:27,746 A:middle
I read this, this is great,
I'm really enjoying it.

673
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:30,036 A:middle
Get to the bottom,
there's the next article.

674
00:35:30,036 --> 00:35:32,926 A:middle
I can just scroll right
through to the next article just

675
00:35:32,926 --> 00:35:33,376 A:middle
like that.

676
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:40,106 A:middle
Awesome. We also have a
beautiful new look for Reader.

677
00:35:40,106 --> 00:35:43,476 A:middle
Here is Reader and I'm
going to bring up my--

678
00:35:43,546 --> 00:35:46,526 A:middle
I can actually close
up my sidebar here.

679
00:35:47,056 --> 00:35:49,896 A:middle
And now, as I scroll reading
and I just want to read

680
00:35:49,896 --> 00:35:52,466 A:middle
from one article to the
next, it's just like that.

681
00:35:52,466 --> 00:35:57,166 A:middle
Super clean and super nice and
that's Safari in Mavericks.

685
00:36:04,326 --> 00:36:05,916 A:middle
So, we have some
more improvements

686
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:08,336 A:middle
that I think are going to really
help you with your browsing

687
00:36:08,336 --> 00:36:11,586 A:middle
and one of them is
iCloud Keychain, yeah.

688
00:36:14,516 --> 00:36:17,246 A:middle
You know, to really
be secure these days,

689
00:36:17,246 --> 00:36:20,896 A:middle
you want to have a different
complex password for every site

690
00:36:20,896 --> 00:36:23,396 A:middle
where you have a log in
but this inevitably brings

691
00:36:23,396 --> 00:36:25,716 A:middle
up the question,
"what's my password?"

692
00:36:26,176 --> 00:36:28,516 A:middle
and these solutions
are not recommended.

693
00:36:29,526 --> 00:36:30,676 A:middle
There is a better way.

694
00:36:30,946 --> 00:36:34,356 A:middle
With iCloud Keychain, we can
remember your website logins,

695
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:37,706 A:middle
your credit card numbers,
even your Wi-Fi networks

696
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:44,126 A:middle
and they're always encrypted,
synced across all of your system

697
00:36:44,126 --> 00:36:45,466 A:middle
so they are always
available to you.

698
00:36:45,886 --> 00:36:48,106 A:middle
Now, when you go to
sign up for a website,

699
00:36:48,976 --> 00:36:51,706 A:middle
you can of course enter your own
password and we'll remember it

700
00:36:51,706 --> 00:36:56,136 A:middle
but as well, Safari can auto
suggest a password for you.

701
00:36:56,946 --> 00:36:59,856 A:middle
You don't have to remember that
but it'll enter it in for you

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

703
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,156 A:middle
and then sync it across
all of your systems

704
00:37:02,156 --> 00:37:03,616 A:middle
and login for you from then on.

iCloud Keychain is great
for your shopping as well.

707
00:37:14,456 --> 00:37:18,916 A:middle
When you come to a credit card
field, you can suggest any

708
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:21,626 A:middle
of your remembered
credit cards, select one

709
00:37:22,386 --> 00:37:24,476 A:middle
and it'll just enter it in
for you just like that along

710
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:25,526 A:middle
with your expiration date.

711
00:37:25,526 --> 00:37:27,766 A:middle
But you have to remember
your own security code,

712
00:37:27,766 --> 00:37:29,446 A:middle
that's what makes
it secure after all

713
00:37:30,636 --> 00:37:31,976 A:middle
and that's iCloud Keychain.

Next, some improvements
to Notifications.

716
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:45,636 A:middle
So now, with Notifications on
the Mac, if you're a Californian

717
00:37:45,636 --> 00:37:48,186 A:middle
like me, you'll often get
this kind of notification,

718
00:37:48,636 --> 00:37:50,816 A:middle
"Hey want to go surf
these 30 foot waves?"

719
00:37:50,816 --> 00:37:53,896 A:middle
And you response, surely is
to mouse over the notification

720
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:56,736 A:middle
and immediately right there,
reply, "Yeah sure I'm going

721
00:37:56,736 --> 00:37:57,796 A:middle
to surf that 30 foot wave."

722
00:37:58,016 --> 00:38:01,456 A:middle
You can reply right inside the
Notification and you can do this

723
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

724
00:38:01,456 --> 00:38:02,626 A:middle
for things like email

725
00:38:02,626 --> 00:38:04,776 A:middle
and quickly delete email
you might not want to deal

726
00:38:04,776 --> 00:38:06,576 A:middle
with without even
having to go to Mail.

727
00:38:07,376 --> 00:38:09,936 A:middle
If you get a FaceTime call,
you can response saying,

728
00:38:09,936 --> 00:38:11,866 A:middle
"Hey I'm going to call
you later," or remind

729
00:38:11,896 --> 00:38:13,336 A:middle
without having to
pick up the call.

730
00:38:13,586 --> 00:38:14,496 A:middle
It's really handy.

731
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:17,616 A:middle
We also handle a new
kind of notification.

732
00:38:18,216 --> 00:38:21,676 A:middle
So if you have an app today
that sends push notifications

733
00:38:21,676 --> 00:38:24,686 A:middle
to iOS devices, well
now, you can sign

734
00:38:24,686 --> 00:38:27,126 A:middle
up to receive those push
notifications on your Mac

735
00:38:27,126 --> 00:38:29,886 A:middle
as well whether Safari
is running or not.

736
00:38:33,316 --> 00:38:36,356 A:middle
So, things like your
Fantasy Football alert,

737
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:42,926 A:middle
maybe Breaking News, news
about that buy on eBay.

738
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:48,346 A:middle
And now, in Mavericks when
your machine is sleeping,

739
00:38:49,546 --> 00:38:51,906 A:middle
when you wake it up, it
will tell you everything

740
00:38:51,906 --> 00:38:54,296 A:middle
that you missed while you're
away right on the lock screen.

741

for you right in the background

00:43:00,626 --> 00:43:03,086 A:middle
And because this is a
Mac, I can tear this off

818
00:43:03,086 --> 00:43:04,016 A:middle
so if I'm planning a trip,

819
00:43:04,056 --> 00:43:05,896 A:middle
I can set aside some
things of interest.

820
00:43:06,926 --> 00:43:08,146 A:middle
I can, of course,
get directions.

821
00:43:08,316 --> 00:43:10,406 A:middle
Let's do that here, directions
from the Eiffel Tower.

822
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:15,136 A:middle
And when I'm ready to
go, I can send it right

823

to my phone like this.

824
00:43:17,146 --> 00:43:19,166 A:middle

826
00:43:25,926 --> 00:43:28,196 A:middle
Next, let's take a look
at the new Calendar.

827
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:32,926 A:middle
It has continuous scrolling and
what's really amazing is even

828
00:43:32,926 --> 00:43:34,036 A:middle
without the stitching,

829
00:43:34,206 --> 00:43:37,166 A:middle
the Window still sticks
right there on the screen.

830
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:38,566 A:middle
It doesn't fall off
without the stitching.

831
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:41,766 A:middle
I don't know how we did it.

832
00:43:41,766 --> 00:43:42,756 A:middle
It's engineering.

833
00:43:43,896 --> 00:43:47,736 A:middle
It's really great for
creating events so if I go

834
00:43:47,736 --> 00:43:49,456 A:middle
and create an event like
this, let's say I'm going

835
00:43:49,456 --> 00:43:53,216 A:middle
to have lunch and I'm going to
type in what I want for lunch,

836
00:43:53,216 --> 00:43:54,286 A:middle
I'm going to say I want pizza.

837
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:58,176 A:middle
And you notice, it suggests
all sorts of locations nearby

838
00:43:58,176 --> 00:44:00,446 A:middle
so I'm going to select
Tony's Pizza

840
00:44:01,336 --> 00:44:02,466 A:middle
and you notice I get a map.

841
00:44:02,976 --> 00:44:06,346 A:middle
I even get projected weather
for that location so I know

842
00:44:06,346 --> 00:44:07,756 A:middle
if I need to bring a jacket.

843
00:44:08,776 --> 00:44:10,676 A:middle
Now, I can select here
and actually ask it

844
00:44:11,096 --> 00:44:13,876 A:middle
to tell me what the
travel time is expected

845
00:44:13,876 --> 00:44:16,786 A:middle
from my last location
so I can decide

846
00:44:16,786 --> 00:44:17,756 A:middle
if I want to drive or walk.

847
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:19,056 A:middle
I'm going to say I want to walk

848
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:21,836 A:middle
and it actually adds the travel
time right to my Calendar

849
00:44:21,836 --> 00:44:23,416 A:middle
so I know not to
schedule anything there.

[ Applause ]

851
00:44:30,046 --> 00:44:33,476 A:middle
And I don't have to remember
because I can ask to be notified

00:44:34,246 --> 00:44:36,046 A:middle
when I need to leave and
I'll get a notification both

853

a look at iBooks.

856
00:44:47,796 --> 00:44:50,646 A:middle
So, I have all my books here,
of course, I can browse my--

00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,226 A:middle
the collections I've arranged.

858
00:44:53,086 --> 00:44:56,196 A:middle

and read, move easily
between the pages.

00:45:04,316 --> 00:45:06,446 A:middle
You have access to all
the controls you'd expect.

Go into a nice night mode that's
relaxing for the eyes but,

866
00:45:16,006 --> 00:45:20,686 A:middle
of course, I really love these
interactive iBooks Textbooks.

867
00:45:20,856 --> 00:45:22,116 A:middle
Let's open one of those up now.

868
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:25,096 A:middle
So, I can scroll through
the pages in my book,

869
00:45:26,346 --> 00:45:28,156 A:middle
see all of this nice
interactives and videos.

870
00:45:28,156 --> 00:45:31,106 A:middle
I can pinch right into a
graphical table of contents,

871
00:45:31,826 --> 00:45:34,466 A:middle
scroll through the
pages of this chapter.

872
00:45:34,466 --> 00:45:40,526 A:middle
I can select another chapter,
scroll through just like this

way the cellular structure works

875
00:45:47,376 --> 00:45:50,376 A:middle
for instance on this leaf,
I can just drill right in

876
00:45:51,046 --> 00:45:54,696 A:middle
and see all the way
through this.

It's also a great
environment for taking notes,

just select some text, add
a note, ask the teacher

about this, take
a note like that.

883
00:46:16,096 --> 00:46:18,996 A:middle
Because it's a Mac, of
course, I can just stretch out

884

and get the sidebar where
I can see all my notes

I'd like to talk to you
about the MacBook Air.

919
00:48:09,516 --> 00:48:12,736 A:middle
The MacBook Air answer
the question in this age

920
00:48:12,736 --> 00:48:15,846 A:middle
of the iPad, what is the
future of the notebook?

921
00:48:16,416 --> 00:48:19,096 A:middle
The MacBook Air really
gave us a direction

922
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:20,816 A:middle
of where the notebook can go,

923
00:48:20,816 --> 00:48:23,856 A:middle
and it's really become
everyone's ultimate

924
00:48:24,246 --> 00:48:26,046 A:middle
everyday notebook.

925
00:48:26,386 --> 00:48:28,776 A:middle
And that's why we're really
pleased to tell you today

926
00:48:28,776 --> 00:48:32,656 A:middle
that we've updated an entirely
new line of MacBook Air.

927
00:48:32,656 --> 00:48:36,296 A:middle
And these new MacBook Airs
deliver the most important

928
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:37,736 A:middle
feature we always want

929
00:48:38,076 --> 00:48:42,696 A:middle
in a portable device,
all day battery life.

930
00:48:42,696 --> 00:48:42,866 A:middle
Yes.

932
00:48:47,786 --> 00:48:49,686 A:middle
And the MacBook Air is based

933
00:48:49,686 --> 00:48:52,926 A:middle
on a new 4th Generation
Intel Core Processor,

934
00:48:53,286 --> 00:48:55,486 A:middle
otherwise known as Haswell ULT.

935
00:48:55,486 --> 00:48:59,366 A:middle
And if you don't know Haswell
ULT, it's a great processor

936
00:48:59,416 --> 00:49:01,506 A:middle
for incredible power savings.

938
00:49:01,736 --> 00:49:03,996 A:middle
There's more energy-efficient
CPUs,

939
00:49:04,056 --> 00:49:06,316 A:middle
there's twice the
graphics execution units

940
00:49:06,656 --> 00:49:08,796 A:middle
so we can run them actually
to slower clock speed

941
00:49:08,796 --> 00:49:12,466 A:middle
to save energy and still
deliver the 40 percent faster

942
00:49:12,466 --> 00:49:13,506 A:middle
graphics performance.

943
00:49:14,046 --> 00:49:15,776 A:middle
And the Apple engineers
have worked together

944
00:49:15,776 --> 00:49:19,436 A:middle
with the Intel engineers on
some great low power state

945
00:49:19,436 --> 00:49:21,636 A:middle
so we can do things
like wake in one second

946
00:49:21,886 --> 00:49:24,406 A:middle
or standby for up to 30 days.

947
00:49:24,946 --> 00:49:26,896 A:middle
But the biggest benefit
is battery life

948
00:49:27,206 --> 00:49:29,666 A:middle
so here is the current
generation MacBook Air,

949
00:49:29,956 --> 00:49:31,536 A:middle
11 inch and 13 inch.

950
00:49:31,876 --> 00:49:35,266 A:middle
The 11 inch is now going to go
from 5 hours of battery life

951
00:49:35,836 --> 00:49:43,866 A:middle
up to an incredible 9
hours of battery life.

952
00:49:43,866 --> 00:49:46,436 A:middle
And if you like that,
the 13 inch goes from 7

953
00:49:46,436 --> 00:49:51,306 A:middle
to 12 hours of battery life.

954
00:49:51,306 --> 00:49:54,266 A:middle
Yes, true, all day
battery life and it helps

955
00:49:54,266 --> 00:49:55,676 A:middle
across your entire system.

956
00:49:56,016 --> 00:49:58,716 A:middle
For example, if you like
watching movies from iTunes,

957
00:49:58,716 --> 00:50:01,976 A:middle
up to 10 hours, you can watch
almost the entire Trilogy

958
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

959
00:50:01,976 --> 00:50:03,966 A:middle
of Lord of the Rings,
it's amazing.

960
00:50:04,116 --> 00:50:07,376 A:middle
And of course, MacBook Air
is based entirely on Flash.

961
00:50:07,636 --> 00:50:10,286 A:middle
Flash is faster, up
to 45 percent faster

962
00:50:10,286 --> 00:50:13,466 A:middle
than the previous version
and Wi-Fi is faster too,

963
00:50:13,466 --> 00:50:16,126 A:middle
now 802.11ac Wi-Fi networking.

964
00:50:18,496 --> 00:50:21,536 A:middle
Now, ac gets you up to
three times the performance

965
00:50:21,536 --> 00:50:24,216 A:middle
of 802.11n at the same distance.

966
00:50:24,686 --> 00:50:27,186 A:middle
But the way to get that of
course is you want your MacBook

967
00:50:27,186 --> 00:50:31,816 A:middle
Air to talk to a Wi-Fi base
station that supports 802.11ac.

968
00:50:32,036 --> 00:50:33,366 A:middle
So, we're really happy to along

969
00:50:33,366 --> 00:50:37,156 A:middle
with MacBook Air announce some
new AirPort Base Stations,

970
00:50:37,486 --> 00:50:41,636 A:middle
entirely new designs, they're
actually a very small base,

971
00:50:41,636 --> 00:50:44,726 A:middle
just 4 inches square but
extruded 6 and a half inches

972
00:50:44,726 --> 00:50:46,906 A:middle
to get wider range
from those antennas.

973
00:50:47,366 --> 00:50:50,556 A:middle
So there's a new AirPort
Extreme that does 802.11ac.

974
00:50:50,676 --> 00:50:52,696 A:middle
There's also room in
there for a hard drive

975
00:50:52,696 --> 00:50:55,076 A:middle
so you have a new AirPort

sounds cool.

982
00:51:03,826 --> 00:51:08,456 A:middle
Beamforming can send more energy
directly to an 802.11ac device

Like with MacBook Air,

1025
00:53:12,766 --> 00:53:15,526 A:middle
our engineering team has spent
quite a bit of time thinking

about the technology available
today and what could be possible

new capabilities for
another 10 years?

And the engineering
team has come

1031
00:53:30,186 --> 00:53:34,746 A:middle
up with something truly
revolutionary, truly radical

1032

in the upcoming movie
"Monsters U" running

1137
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:08,736 A:middle
on the new generation Mac Pro
and you want to check it out.

1138
01:00:08,736 --> 01:00:11,896 A:middle

>> You're going to love
the Mac Pro, it's killer.

1141
01:00:25,346 --> 01:00:27,976 A:middle
Next, I'd like to
talk about iCloud.

1142
01:00:28,556 --> 01:00:34,416 A:middle
We've now passed 300 million
iCloud accounts making iCloud

1143
01:00:34,416 --> 01:00:37,386 A:middle
the fastest growing
Cloud service ever.

1144
01:00:38,646 --> 01:00:43,896 A:middle
Now, by comparison, it
took Facebook five years

1145
01:00:43,896 --> 01:00:45,136 A:middle
to reach this many accounts.

1146
01:00:46,126 --> 01:00:50,036 A:middle
One of the most popular features
of iCloud is iTunes in the Cloud

1147
01:00:50,496 --> 01:00:52,946 A:middle
which makes all of your
purchase content available

1148
01:00:52,946 --> 01:00:54,126 A:middle
on all of your devices.

1149
01:00:54,796 --> 01:00:58,676 A:middle
We now have 300 million users
of this feature and they read

1150
01:00:58,676 --> 01:01:02,946 A:middle
out of their content
35 billion times.

1152
01:01:04,026 --> 01:01:08,216 A:middle
Now, the back-end infrastructure
of iCloud allows us

1153
01:01:08,216 --> 01:01:11,456 A:middle
to provide Cloud services
across many of our products

1154
01:01:12,326 --> 01:01:15,396 A:middle
like Game Center, our
social gaming network now

1155
01:01:15,396 --> 01:01:18,136 A:middle
with over 240 million users.

1156
01:01:19,066 --> 01:01:21,176 A:middle
Sixty of the top 100 games

1157
01:01:21,176 --> 01:01:24,496 A:middle
on the App Store integrate
Game Center support right

1158
01:01:24,496 --> 01:01:25,286 A:middle
in their game.

1159
01:01:26,556 --> 01:01:30,776 A:middle
iCloud is also --
has incredible scale

1160
01:01:31,586 --> 01:01:35,106 A:middle
like sending 800
billion iMessages,

1161
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:40,796 A:middle
or a mind-boggling 7.4
trillion push notifications.

1162
01:01:44,516 --> 01:01:48,776 A:middle
iCloud allows us to seamlessly
integrate Cloud services

1163
01:01:48,776 --> 01:01:50,476 A:middle
into so many of our products

1164
01:01:50,556 --> 01:01:54,786 A:middle
across Apple in both
OS X and iOS.

1165
01:01:56,316 --> 01:02:01,636 A:middle
Today, we want to share with
you how we're deeply integrating

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

iCloud into the next
version of iWork.

1168
01:02:05,776 --> 01:02:08,596 A:middle
And to do that, I'd like
to invite Roger Rosner

1169
01:02:08,596 --> 01:02:09,596 A:middle
up to the stage.

1170
01:02:10,306 --> 01:02:10,646 A:middle

[ Applause ]

1172
01:02:17,646 --> 01:02:20,516 A:middle
>> Hello. Hi, let me tell
you a little bit about iWork.

1173
01:02:21,216 --> 01:02:23,426 A:middle
iWork is pages, numbers,
and keynote.

1174
01:02:23,896 --> 01:02:26,766 A:middle
And we think it's the best way
to create beautiful documents,

1175
01:02:26,996 --> 01:02:28,416 A:middle
spreadsheets and presentations.

1176
01:02:29,446 --> 01:02:32,716 A:middle
Of course, iWork was born on
the Mac and it has full support

1177
01:02:32,716 --> 01:02:36,166 A:middle
for the awesome feature set
of Mac OS X and Mac hardware.

1178
01:02:37,036 --> 01:02:40,416 A:middle
We also have amazingly powerful
and fully multi-touch versions

1179
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:43,766 A:middle
of these apps on the
iPad and on the iPhone.

1180
01:02:44,556 --> 01:02:46,996 A:middle
We think our multi-touch
apps are the most powerful

1181
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:49,666 A:middle
productivity apps ever
created for a mobile device.

1182
01:02:50,476 --> 01:02:53,386 A:middle
And later this year, we're going
to have awesome new releases

1183
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:56,326 A:middle
of both our Mac and
our iOS suites.

1184
01:02:57,236 --> 01:03:00,996 A:middle
But today, I want to
introduce the newest member

1185
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1186
01:03:00,996 --> 01:03:06,006 A:middle
of the iWork family,
introducing iWork for iCloud.

1187
01:03:07,086 --> 01:03:10,726 A:middle
iWork for iCloud lets you
create beautiful documents right

1188
01:03:10,726 --> 01:03:13,836 A:middle
in a browser on a
Mac or on a PC.

1189
01:03:13,936 --> 01:03:16,476 A:middle
And rather than talk about it,

1190
01:03:16,606 --> 01:03:17,946 A:middle
let's just jump right
into a demo.

1191
01:03:18,516 --> 01:03:24,986 A:middle
[ Applause ]

1192
01:03:25,486 --> 01:03:28,746 A:middle
All right, I'm going to fire
up Safari on my Mac here

1193
01:03:29,496 --> 01:03:32,216 A:middle
and go straight to
my iCloud homepage

1194
01:03:32,216 --> 01:03:36,166 A:middle
where you see three new app
icons, and I click on Pages.

1195
01:03:36,786 --> 01:03:41,326 A:middle
And here is all the documents
I've been working on, on my Mac

1196
01:03:41,326 --> 01:03:43,236 A:middle
or my iPad and saved in iCloud.

1197
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:46,596 A:middle
I can create a new document by
clicking Plus and I have a bunch

1198
01:03:46,596 --> 01:03:48,306 A:middle
of beautiful Apple-designed
templates.

1199
01:03:48,306 --> 01:03:51,896 A:middle
But let's just open a
document we were working on.

1200
01:03:55,846 --> 01:03:58,866 A:middle
And as you can see, it's a
beautiful Pages document,

1201
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1202
01:04:00,316 --> 01:04:03,946 A:middle
great fonts, graphics,
images, page layouts.

1203
01:04:04,626 --> 01:04:08,886 A:middle
This is all happening in
a web browser of course.

1204
01:04:10,006 --> 01:04:11,586 A:middle
So I can just click
here and type.

1205
01:04:12,346 --> 01:04:17,296 A:middle
And over here, I have all
the formatting controls

1206
01:04:17,296 --> 01:04:19,336 A:middle
in our new context-sensitive
format panel.

1207
01:04:19,336 --> 01:04:23,926 A:middle
So I'll just select some
text, go up to my Styles,

1208
01:04:24,216 --> 01:04:29,666 A:middle
choose a text style, select
some more text, choose another.

1209
01:04:30,426 --> 01:04:33,036 A:middle
I can click on some images.

1210
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:36,296 A:middle
And you see, my controls
now show me Image Controls.

1211
01:04:36,296 --> 01:04:39,836 A:middle
I can click on a bunch of
styles, choose that one.

1212
01:04:39,836 --> 01:04:43,656 A:middle
Now, of course, Pages has always
been great at handling graphics.

1213
01:04:43,786 --> 01:04:45,426 A:middle
So, how do I add graphics?

1214
01:04:45,426 --> 01:04:48,346 A:middle
Well, I drag one
in from my desktop,

1215
01:04:49,336 --> 01:04:52,466 A:middle
drop it in there
and drag it around.

Now, we know we live
in a world full

of Microsoft Office documents,
so how do we work with Office?

1221
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:09,066 A:middle
Well I have a Word document
here, and I'm just going to drag

1222
01:05:09,066 --> 01:05:10,776 A:middle
that in from my desktop and drop

1223
01:05:10,776 --> 01:05:12,696 A:middle
that in the Pages
for iCloud window.

1224
01:05:13,496 --> 01:05:14,246 A:middle
It uploads it.

1225
01:05:15,026 --> 01:05:15,936 A:middle

Back to my iCloud homepage,
click the Numbers icon.

1232

Again, a bunch of
beautiful documents.

1233
01:05:40,816 --> 01:05:45,986 A:middle
As you can see, this spreadsheet
has a bunch of different sheets

1234
01:05:45,986 --> 01:05:49,256 A:middle
in it, great charts,
great tables and graphics.

1235
01:05:50,056 --> 01:05:51,596 A:middle
Here on the last
sheet, we have a table

1236

that hasn't been finished.

1237
01:05:52,506 --> 01:05:55,566 A:middle
So I'm just going to click
in a cell, hit Equals.

and there you go,
my chart updates.

If I want to fill this
across the rest of the table,

to make enjoyable.

1458
01:19:18,456 --> 01:19:22,116 A:middle
To create it, we brought
together a broad range

1459
01:19:22,186 --> 01:19:26,896 A:middle
of expertise from
design to engineering.

1460
01:19:27,196 --> 01:19:31,276 A:middle
With what we've been able to
achieve together, we see iOS 7

1461
01:19:31,276 --> 01:19:35,586 A:middle
as defining an important
new direction,

1462
01:19:36,126 --> 01:19:37,916 A:middle
and in many ways, a beginning.

This major effort, this
major effort is only possible

1471
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:33,276 A:middle
because of the incredible
collaboration between Johnny

and his amazing design
team and Craig

and his incredible

1474

Without further ado, I'd like
to invite Craig, back up,

1475
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:50,256 A:middle
to take you through iOS
7, the biggest change

who worked so hard to
make today a reality,

1482

I'm absolutely thrilled at this
opportunity to show you iOS 7.

1483

Let's take a look.

It's unbelievable.

1485
01:21:21,216 --> 01:21:22,576 A:middle
It's just gorgeous.

1486
01:21:22,876 --> 01:21:27,916 A:middle
From the typography on this
lock screen to the vitality

1487
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:31,916 A:middle
of the background of an
animation, to the home screen

1488
01:21:32,426 --> 01:21:37,016 A:middle
with these icons, it looks so
great, it just look fantastic.

1489
01:21:37,016 --> 01:21:41,906 A:middle
And, you know, a lot of us have
our own wallpaper, you know,

1490
01:21:41,906 --> 01:21:43,396 A:middle
I mean like pictures
of our family there.

1491
01:21:43,396 --> 01:21:46,886 A:middle
And now that liveliness
actually carries

1492
01:21:46,946 --> 01:21:50,306 A:middle
through to the home screen,
because as you move the device

1493
01:21:50,306 --> 01:21:52,986 A:middle
on your hand it actually
tracks your motion.

1494
01:21:54,406 --> 01:21:57,066 A:middle
And as parallax that-- but you
can see the behind the icons.

1495
01:21:57,326 --> 01:21:59,776 A:middle
It's really incredible
and it carries

1496
01:21:59,776 --> 01:22:02,006 A:middle
over across the system,
this liveliness.

I mean just take a look
at something like weather,

1499
01:22:05,576 --> 01:22:08,246 A:middle
with emotion conveys this
information and where the edge

1500
01:22:08,246 --> 01:22:11,156 A:middle
to edge design just takes
advantage of every pixel

1501
01:22:11,856 --> 01:22:12,976 A:middle
on that retina display.

1502
01:22:13,576 --> 01:22:14,406 A:middle
It's so nice.

1503
01:22:15,816 --> 01:22:19,176 A:middle
It's great for apps you use
everyday, like messages,

1504
01:22:19,546 --> 01:22:25,876 A:middle
your calendar, your
email is gorgeous.

looked more attractive.

This has got to be good
for the environment.

1511
01:22:49,156 --> 01:22:50,466 A:middle
The clocks look great.

1512
01:22:50,926 --> 01:22:53,906 A:middle
And even apps like
Stocks and Compass,

1513
01:22:53,906 --> 01:22:56,906 A:middle
but they just have this look of
precision, a sense of purpose.

1514

The best way to appreciate
iOS 7 is to see it live.

01:23:12,846 --> 01:23:13,476 A:middle
Here it is.

1520
01:23:13,476 --> 01:23:16,316 A:middle
You can see how the
device actually response

1521
01:23:16,316 --> 01:23:17,586 A:middle
to the motion in my hand.

1522
01:23:18,646 --> 01:23:20,696 A:middle
Just slide out the lock screen.

1523
01:23:20,696 --> 01:23:21,316 A:middle
You see how it slides in.

1524
01:23:21,316 --> 01:23:22,336 A:middle
And I want you now to look away

1525
01:23:22,336 --> 01:23:24,586 A:middle
for a moment while I
type in my password.

1526
01:23:24,626 --> 01:23:25,886 A:middle
OK, you can look again.

1527
01:23:26,806 --> 01:23:28,176 A:middle
OK, don't tell anyone
about that.

1528
01:23:28,876 --> 01:23:29,056 A:middle
All right.

1529
01:23:29,156 --> 01:23:33,286 A:middle
So here we are on the
gorgeous new home screen.

1530
01:23:33,286 --> 01:23:34,196 A:middle
Let's go into Weather.

1531
01:23:35,476 --> 01:23:37,546 A:middle
You see in Weather, it's
a little cloudy today.

1532
01:23:37,546 --> 01:23:41,126 A:middle
I can actually tap here, the
degrees get more information

1533
01:23:41,126 --> 01:23:45,646 A:middle
like humidity and rain,
swipe through some locations,

1534
01:23:47,086 --> 01:23:50,866 A:middle
clear in Sydney, kind
of hot in Phoenix.

1535
01:23:52,766 --> 01:23:56,406 A:middle
Here in a big thunder mountain,
it's looking little rough.

snow here on the North Pole

1539
01:24:08,066 --> 01:24:11,926 A:middle
and tropical storm here
in Gilligan's Island,

1540
01:24:11,926 --> 01:24:13,816 A:middle
I hope they got off that island.

1541
01:24:14,206 --> 01:24:18,116 A:middle
So, and it's no functional
than ever.

1542
01:24:18,116 --> 01:24:22,336 A:middle
If you pinch, you get
this gorgeous overview

1543
01:24:22,586 --> 01:24:23,416 A:middle
of all your cities.

1544

it's a world clock as well.

at the Calendar.

days to day like this,

turn it into landscape,
see your whole week

we even go all the
way out to the year.

Let's take a look at Messages.

01:24:52,016 --> 01:24:56,696 A:middle
You know, so we scroll,
we have this great sort

1553
01:24:56,696 --> 01:24:57,646 A:middle
of playful motion.

1554
01:24:57,646 --> 01:25:01,626 A:middle

up the keyboard,

1556
01:25:02,046 --> 01:25:03,906 A:middle
lets you slide contents
of the keyboard.

1557
01:25:03,906 --> 01:25:06,636 A:middle
You see the layering in
transparency, it gives you

1558
01:25:06,636 --> 01:25:07,846 A:middle
that sense of context.

1559
01:25:08,666 --> 01:25:10,996 A:middle
There's this gesture now from
the left edge of the device,

1560
01:25:10,996 --> 01:25:12,746 A:middle
it's great for using
the device at one hand.

1561
01:25:12,746 --> 01:25:15,376 A:middle
If I want to just go back, I
can just swipe from the edge

1562
01:25:15,376 --> 01:25:19,826 A:middle
of the display, pull back
like that, move in and out.

1563
01:25:20,956 --> 01:25:21,956 A:middle
So clean and natural.

1564
01:25:21,956 --> 01:25:24,616 A:middle
Let's take a look at folders,

1565
01:25:24,796 --> 01:25:26,326 A:middle
and it go here into
my Games folder.

1566
01:25:26,326 --> 01:25:29,106 A:middle
I can have multiple pages,

1567
01:25:29,966 --> 01:25:35,926 A:middle
stored under these
items not folders.

1568
01:25:35,926 --> 01:25:36,176 A:middle
It's awesome.

1569
01:25:36,766 --> 01:25:38,316 A:middle
Take a look at Game Center.

1570
01:25:39,026 --> 01:25:47,496 A:middle
Some of those good
looking friends.

1571
01:25:47,496 --> 01:25:49,866 A:middle
Let's take a look at Mail.

1572
01:25:50,606 --> 01:25:55,506 A:middle
And the type is just so clean
and you drill into a message.

1573
01:25:55,686 --> 01:25:57,666 A:middle
Look at how you get
this full screen edge

1574
01:25:57,666 --> 01:25:59,466 A:middle
to edge photos, it's
really great.

1575
01:25:59,466 --> 01:26:00,886 A:middle
And that gesture from moving in

1576
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1577
01:26:00,886 --> 01:26:02,136 A:middle
and out works here
too, of course.

1578
01:26:02,586 --> 01:26:05,396 A:middle
Just move between
messages, just like this.

1579
01:26:05,396 --> 01:26:06,126 A:middle
It's so great.

1580
01:26:07,036 --> 01:26:09,016 A:middle
And if you just slide
across in any item,

1581
01:26:09,046 --> 01:26:11,886 A:middle
you can get at the
Trash and More Options

1582
01:26:12,196 --> 01:26:13,926 A:middle
as well right here in Mail.

1583
01:26:14,996 --> 01:26:17,256 A:middle
Finally, let's take a look
at Notification Center.

1584
01:26:17,706 --> 01:26:19,656 A:middle
Same as always, we can
just swipe out from the top

1585
01:26:19,656 --> 01:26:21,726 A:middle
of the device, comes
down with a nice thud,

1586
01:26:21,726 --> 01:26:24,486 A:middle
you can see all notifications,
just might miss once.

1587
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:26,296 A:middle
And we've just great
new Today view.

1588
01:26:26,296 --> 01:26:29,666 A:middle
So you can see you friends'
birthdays current look

1589
01:26:29,666 --> 01:26:35,366 A:middle
at the weather, your upcoming
invitations, your calendar,

1590
01:26:35,596 --> 01:26:39,706 A:middle
your stocks, and even a
quickly look at tomorrow.

1591
01:26:40,156 --> 01:26:41,216 A:middle
You know, it's really great

1592
01:26:41,216 --> 01:26:45,136 A:middle
as for the first time ever
Notification Center is now

1593
01:26:45,136 --> 01:26:47,586 A:middle
available from the
lock screen as well.

1594
01:26:47,666 --> 01:26:49,316 A:middle
You don't even have
to unlock your device.

1595
01:26:51,846 --> 01:26:55,626 A:middle
[applause] So that's
a quick look at iOS 7.

1596
01:26:56,146 --> 01:27:01,026 A:middle
It's a comprehensive end-to-end
redesign of the user experience.

1597
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1598
01:27:01,846 --> 01:27:04,416 A:middle
Installing iOS 7
on your phone is

1599
01:27:04,416 --> 01:27:06,176 A:middle
like getting an entirely
new phone,

1600
01:27:06,176 --> 01:27:08,556 A:middle
but when you already
know how to use,

1601
01:27:09,046 --> 01:27:12,826 A:middle
when it's so much more beautiful
and functional than ever before.

1602
01:27:14,456 --> 01:27:16,966 A:middle
But iOS 7 is actually
more than that.

1603
01:27:17,536 --> 01:27:20,266 A:middle
It's also a major
feature release as well.

1604
01:27:20,266 --> 01:27:23,346 A:middle
I have 10 features I want
to talk to you about today,

1605
01:27:23,766 --> 01:27:26,226 A:middle
starting with Control Center.

1606
01:27:27,646 --> 01:27:29,036 A:middle
Control Center is
something that's

1607
01:27:29,356 --> 01:27:31,396 A:middle
so simple and yet so essential.

1608
01:27:31,926 --> 01:27:34,036 A:middle
You have those switches
that you just want to get

1609
01:27:34,036 --> 01:27:35,816 A:middle
to really quickly
from wherever you are.

1610
01:27:35,906 --> 01:27:38,966 A:middle
Well, now, with Control Center,
swipe up from that bottom

1611
01:27:38,966 --> 01:27:41,376 A:middle
of the device and
there they are.

1612

[ Applause ]

1613
01:27:46,976 --> 01:27:50,646 A:middle
Turn on Airplane Mode, adjust
your brightness, play a song,

1614
01:27:51,476 --> 01:27:57,096 A:middle
even get at a flashlight,
and available from anywhere,

1615
01:27:57,096 --> 01:27:58,306 A:middle
including your lock screen.

1616
01:27:58,306 --> 01:28:00,286 A:middle

of the night and you need

to find something, your
flashlight's right there.

1619
01:28:03,586 --> 01:28:05,126 A:middle
And that's Control Center.

1620
01:28:05,846 --> 01:28:08,636 A:middle
Next, let's talk
about Multitasking.

1621
01:28:09,686 --> 01:28:12,976 A:middle
Now, iOS 7 has always been built

1622
01:28:12,976 --> 01:28:16,266 A:middle
on the industrial strength
foundations of OS X.

1623
01:28:17,206 --> 01:28:20,876 A:middle
It's had intrinsic powerful
multitasking capabilities.

1624
01:28:21,096 --> 01:28:23,156 A:middle
But we had to be careful
about how we'd exposed these

1625
01:28:23,156 --> 01:28:26,266 A:middle
to applications because we want
to preserve great battery life.

1626
01:28:27,246 --> 01:28:31,696 A:middle
Now on iOS 4 we did add
support for select kinds

1627
01:28:31,696 --> 01:28:33,536 A:middle
of applications to
do multitasking.

1628
01:28:33,596 --> 01:28:37,216 A:middle
Things like plain music in the
background or receiving a voice

1629
01:28:37,216 --> 01:28:40,246 A:middle
over IP call, or your
app is in the background.

1630
01:28:40,806 --> 01:28:44,026 A:middle
Well, now, in iOS 7, I'm pleased
to announce that we're going

1631
01:28:44,026 --> 01:28:48,976 A:middle
to have multitasking for all
apps with great battery life.

1632
01:28:49,516 --> 01:28:55,076 A:middle
[ Applause ]

1633
01:28:55,576 --> 01:28:56,466 A:middle
So, how does it work?

1634
01:28:57,386 --> 01:28:58,836 A:middle
Well, imagine you have an app

1635
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:01,436 A:middle
that you're using
constantly throughout the day,

1636
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1637
01:29:01,436 --> 01:29:03,986 A:middle
a social networking app or
something and you're checking

1638
01:29:03,986 --> 01:29:07,176 A:middle
in all of the time, what iOS
7 has noticed is that pattern

1639
01:29:07,176 --> 01:29:08,816 A:middle
of use and is going
to provide that app

1640
01:29:08,816 --> 01:29:11,866 A:middle
with frequent background
activity to stay up to date.

1641
01:29:11,866 --> 01:29:15,226 A:middle
And there's even other app you
used, maybe that you just check

1642
01:29:15,226 --> 01:29:17,786 A:middle
in on in the morning or
breakfast, maybe at night

1643
01:29:17,816 --> 01:29:20,356 A:middle
after work, well iOS
7 notices that too.

1644
01:29:20,356 --> 01:29:23,646 A:middle
And it's going to give that
app background cycles just

1645
01:29:23,646 --> 01:29:25,836 A:middle
in time to-- it's up to
date for when you need it.

1646
01:29:26,666 --> 01:29:29,716 A:middle
Now, in addition to this
intelligence scheduling,

1647
01:29:30,176 --> 01:29:32,746 A:middle
iOS 7 does opportunistic
updates.

1648
01:29:33,106 --> 01:29:36,146 A:middle
The average user wakes their
device dozens of time a day

1649
01:29:36,146 --> 01:29:37,696 A:middle
and those provide
great opportunities

1650
01:29:37,896 --> 01:29:39,216 A:middle
when the system's
already powered

1651
01:29:39,216 --> 01:29:41,316 A:middle
up to update apps
on the background.

1652
01:29:42,066 --> 01:29:44,616 A:middle
It also adapts intelligently
the network conditions.

1653
01:29:45,056 --> 01:29:46,856 A:middle
So if it's in-- you
have good coverage,

1654
01:29:47,096 --> 01:29:48,466 A:middle
it's a great time to fetch.

1655
01:29:49,286 --> 01:29:52,586 A:middle
And it coalesces updates
across multiple applications.

1656
01:29:52,586 --> 01:29:54,396 A:middle
So once you have those
radios powered up,

1657
01:29:54,396 --> 01:29:57,156 A:middle
lets multiple applications
take advantage of it

1658
01:29:57,156 --> 01:29:58,366 A:middle
for their background updates.

1659
01:29:58,806 --> 01:30:03,206 A:middle
And, finally, iOS 7 response to
push notifications as a trigger

1660
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1661
01:30:03,206 --> 01:30:05,956 A:middle
to give that application
time in the background.

1662
01:30:06,046 --> 01:30:07,136 A:middle
So when you follow
that notification,

1663
01:30:07,136 --> 01:30:08,516 A:middle
the app will already
be up to date.

[ Applause ]

1665
01:30:15,286 --> 01:30:18,536 A:middle
Now, iOS 7 also has a great
new user interface for moving

1666
01:30:18,666 --> 01:30:20,846 A:middle
between all the things you
have going on on your phone.

1667
01:30:21,366 --> 01:30:25,446 A:middle
Now, you could double click and
move into Notifications Center

1668
01:30:25,446 --> 01:30:27,586 A:middle
and just swipe between
your running applications,

1669
01:30:27,706 --> 01:30:32,236 A:middle
tap and move right in and
that is multitasking in iOS 7.

01:30:38,726 --> 01:30:40,736 A:middle
Next, let's talk about Safari.

1672
01:30:41,466 --> 01:30:45,496 A:middle
Safari is the most popular
mobile browser in the world.

1673
01:30:46,166 --> 01:30:48,386 A:middle
And in iOS 7 we're
making it even better.

1674
01:30:49,726 --> 01:30:52,836 A:middle
Has a great new full
screen look,

1675
01:30:53,446 --> 01:30:54,926 A:middle
really focused on your content.

1676
01:30:55,586 --> 01:30:57,586 A:middle
If you pull down
or tap at the top,

1677
01:30:57,586 --> 01:30:59,616 A:middle
you can now get a
smart search field.

1678
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1679
01:31:00,546 --> 01:31:04,756 A:middle
From that search field, you can
get it one tap access to all

1680
01:31:04,756 --> 01:31:09,026 A:middle
of your favorites as well
as do search and access URLs

1681
01:31:09,436 --> 01:31:12,756 A:middle
and there's a great new
interface for your tabs.

1682
01:31:13,566 --> 01:31:16,496 A:middle
In addition to all of this,
it has parental controls

1683
01:31:16,806 --> 01:31:20,166 A:middle
and integration with the same
iCloud Keychain you saw earlier

1684
01:31:20,746 --> 01:31:21,506 A:middle
with Mavericks.

1685
01:31:22,126 --> 01:31:24,896 A:middle
I'd like to give you
a demo of Safari now.

1686
01:31:25,546 --> 01:31:26,916 A:middle
Let's take a look.

1687
01:31:27,516 --> 01:31:31,086 A:middle
[ Applause ]

1688
01:31:31,586 --> 01:31:37,786 A:middle
OK, head on in to Safari.

1689
01:31:39,106 --> 01:31:40,536 A:middle
So here we are in Safari.

1690
01:31:40,536 --> 01:31:42,306 A:middle
I'm going to just
zoom in on this page.

1691
01:31:42,306 --> 01:31:47,406 A:middle
I want you to watch as I scroll,
all the controls just recede

1692
01:31:47,406 --> 01:31:49,756 A:middle
and now you have that full
screen for your content.

1693
01:31:50,606 --> 01:31:52,626 A:middle
We've really improved the way
you navigate now in Safari.

1694
01:31:52,626 --> 01:31:56,876 A:middle
I'm just going to tap in here
to link to a detailed story.

1695
01:31:57,006 --> 01:31:59,446 A:middle
I mean you can even zoom
in of course on this page.

1696
01:31:59,446 --> 01:32:02,456 A:middle
And that same gesture you saw
earlier for going back well

1697
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1698
01:32:02,456 --> 01:32:04,166 A:middle
of course that works
in Safari as well.

1699
01:32:04,166 --> 01:32:05,956 A:middle
So I just swiped in from
the edge of the display

1700
01:32:05,956 --> 01:32:08,326 A:middle
and I can navigate
back and forth

1701
01:32:08,326 --> 01:32:11,526 A:middle
through my browser
history just like that.

1702
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:14,126 A:middle
It's such a fantastic
way to browse.

1703
01:32:15,026 --> 01:32:17,136 A:middle
Next, let's look at that
unified search field.

1704
01:32:17,136 --> 01:32:18,636 A:middle
I'm just going to tap
up here at the top.

1705
01:32:19,116 --> 01:32:22,066 A:middle
You see I have one tap
access to all my favorites.

1706
01:32:22,176 --> 01:32:23,786 A:middle
It's really convenient
but I'm going to type

1707
01:32:23,786 --> 01:32:25,846 A:middle
in this case so I'll type DIS.

1708
01:32:25,846 --> 01:32:30,146 A:middle
And you notice, I have
a top URL hit as well

1709
01:32:30,146 --> 01:32:33,266 A:middle
as Google Search suggestions as
well available all right here.

1710
01:32:34,336 --> 01:32:36,236 A:middle
We've really improved
bookmarking as well.

1711
01:32:36,236 --> 01:32:38,046 A:middle
I use this bookmark
control down at the bottom.

1712
01:32:38,766 --> 01:32:41,496 A:middle
I see my bookmark
folders, all my bookmarks.

1713
01:32:41,926 --> 01:32:42,866 A:middle
We also have shared links.

1714
01:32:42,866 --> 01:32:46,076 A:middle
You can see stories posted by
people you follow on Twitter.

1715

And my Reading List.

1716
01:32:48,046 --> 01:32:50,776 A:middle
And, now, just like you
saw on Mavericks on iOS,

1717
01:32:50,776 --> 01:32:53,276 A:middle
you can scroll continuously
from article to article

1718
01:32:53,276 --> 01:32:54,756 A:middle
without coming back to the list.

1719

You can see what you left open
on your other devices as well.

And tabs, they're
really nice to use.

1728
01:33:25,576 --> 01:33:28,556 A:middle
You can just tap,
sweep into a tab,

If you want to reorder your
tabs, just tap and hold,

1732

just rearrange them like this.

1733
01:33:37,786 --> 01:33:40,556 A:middle
And if you're done with
the tab, just swipe it off

1734
01:33:40,556 --> 01:33:42,406 A:middle
to the side and it goes away.

on their display and they
can accept what it is

1777
01:35:46,846 --> 01:35:47,616 A:middle
that you shared.

1778
01:35:48,226 --> 01:35:49,046 A:middle
They accept it.

1779
01:35:49,216 --> 01:35:51,726 A:middle
They're taken right into the
app and you know if you want

1780
01:35:51,726 --> 01:35:55,526 A:middle
to share with multiple people
you just tap, tap, tap.

1781
01:35:55,906 --> 01:35:57,636 A:middle
No need to wander
around the room,

1785
01:36:09,036 --> 01:36:11,516 A:middle
Now, this is system wide for
any app that's supports a Share

1786
01:36:11,516 --> 01:36:16,086 A:middle
Sheet and of course it uses peer
to peer Wi-Fi for maximum speed

1787
01:36:16,386 --> 01:36:19,156 A:middle
and all your transmissions
are securely encrypted

1788
01:36:19,556 --> 01:36:22,536 A:middle
because it uses the latest
Wi-Fi hardware, it's supported

1789
01:36:22,536 --> 01:36:25,576 A:middle
on the iPhone 5, the
fourth-generation iPad,

fifth-generation iPod Touch

1791
01:36:30,186 --> 01:36:32,166 A:middle
and that is AirDrop.

1792
01:36:32,596 --> 01:36:34,146 A:middle
Next, let's talk
about the camera.

1793
01:36:35,216 --> 01:36:38,816 A:middle
So, now, your camera in iOS
7 is four cameras in one.

1794
01:36:39,186 --> 01:36:42,546 A:middle
You just swipe from your video
camera to your photo camera,

1795
01:36:43,596 --> 01:36:46,956 A:middle
to your square cropped
camera, to your pano camera.

1796
01:36:47,566 --> 01:36:50,246 A:middle
And when you're taking
stills, you now have access

1797
01:36:50,736 --> 01:36:54,556 A:middle
to live photo filters from
some gorgeous black and whites,

1798
01:36:54,986 --> 01:36:58,106 A:middle
to some classic color
filters as well.

1799
01:36:58,256 --> 01:36:59,686 A:middle
So with your great,
new camera we want

1800
01:36:59,686 --> 01:37:02,256 A:middle
to give you a great new
way to manage your photos

1801
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1802
01:37:02,256 --> 01:37:03,876 A:middle
and it's the new Photos app.

1803
01:37:04,706 --> 01:37:08,406 A:middle
You know for many users this is
what their photo organization

1804
01:37:08,566 --> 01:37:10,436 A:middle
looks like: an endless,

1805
01:37:10,436 --> 01:37:12,946 A:middle
unorganized stream
of their camera roll.

1806
01:37:12,946 --> 01:37:14,406 A:middle
We've all been there
but, you know,

1807
01:37:14,406 --> 01:37:15,966 A:middle
it doesn't have to be this way.

1808
01:37:17,666 --> 01:37:19,926 A:middle
There's great information
in those photos.

1809
01:37:19,926 --> 01:37:22,926 A:middle
iOS knows where you took the
photos and when you took them

1810
01:37:22,926 --> 01:37:26,186 A:middle
and that provides inherent
structure that we can use

1811
01:37:26,186 --> 01:37:27,746 A:middle
to organize those photos.

1812
01:37:27,896 --> 01:37:31,036 A:middle
And now in photos
in iOS 7, we do.

1813
01:37:31,406 --> 01:37:33,036 A:middle
We organize them into moments.

1814
01:37:33,166 --> 01:37:35,276 A:middle
And I'd like to give you
a demo of that right now.

1815
01:37:36,516 --> 01:37:41,936 A:middle
[ Applause ]

1816
01:37:42,436 --> 01:37:44,136 A:middle
So let's take a look
now at the Photos app.

1817
01:37:45,766 --> 01:37:49,916 A:middle
So here you see some photos
that were taken in San Francisco

1818
01:37:49,916 --> 01:37:53,896 A:middle
and you see nothing was done to
organize these photos explicitly

1819
01:37:53,896 --> 01:37:54,816 A:middle
and yet they have these labels.

1820
01:37:54,816 --> 01:37:56,416 A:middle
It's like the Palace
of Fine Arts,

1821
01:37:57,426 --> 01:37:59,716 A:middle
Baker Beach, Lombard Street.

1822
01:37:59,716 --> 01:38:01,556 A:middle
It provides this
natural organization

1823
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1824
01:38:01,556 --> 01:38:02,916 A:middle
for appreciating the photos.

1825
01:38:02,916 --> 01:38:05,986 A:middle
We can go up that more trips
at more times in San Francisco,

1826
01:38:05,986 --> 01:38:08,526 A:middle
Golden Gate, to San
Francisco Fisherman's Wharf.

1827
01:38:08,796 --> 01:38:10,496 A:middle
But then you see we have home.

1828
01:38:10,576 --> 01:38:12,856 A:middle
We have photos taken at
home and photos taken

1829
01:38:12,856 --> 01:38:15,576 A:middle
at the elementary school
and around that area.

1830
01:38:16,266 --> 01:38:19,246 A:middle
And now if you want to
zoom back out to get a--

1831
01:38:19,246 --> 01:38:21,146 A:middle
more of bird's eye view
of your collection,

1832
01:38:21,556 --> 01:38:23,696 A:middle
we draw these moments
intelligently together

1833
01:38:23,696 --> 01:38:24,466 A:middle
into collections.

1834
01:38:25,746 --> 01:38:27,816 A:middle
So see here how that
multiple day trip

1835
01:38:27,816 --> 01:38:30,556 A:middle
around San Francisco is
collected-- sorry about that,

1836
01:38:30,556 --> 01:38:32,466 A:middle
I've got a little
excited there, into--

1837
01:38:32,466 --> 01:38:34,756 A:middle
it's a very exciting interface

1838
01:38:34,756 --> 01:38:38,396 A:middle
into a multi-day trip
in San Francisco.

1839
01:38:38,516 --> 01:38:40,936 A:middle
And that time at home and
around the school, well,

1840
01:38:40,936 --> 01:38:44,026 A:middle
that's one moment-- that's
one collection as well.

1841
01:38:44,466 --> 01:38:46,226 A:middle
It's a really great way
to browse your photos.

1842
01:38:46,566 --> 01:38:50,316 A:middle
You can even go all the
way out to the year level.

1843
01:38:51,716 --> 01:38:53,696 A:middle

01:39:01,276 --> 01:39:04,196 A:middle
And look how we pull out the
interesting places that you went

1847
01:39:04,196 --> 01:39:08,966 A:middle
in that year like 2011 was
Colorado and Hawaii, 2012,

1848
01:39:09,266 --> 01:39:10,346 A:middle
went to South America.

1849
01:39:10,346 --> 01:39:11,666 A:middle
You may not remember
when you did it

1850
01:39:11,666 --> 01:39:13,946 A:middle
but iOS does and
it's right there.

1851
01:39:14,736 --> 01:39:18,456 A:middle
And, you know, with this retina
display you can even can make

1852
01:39:18,456 --> 01:39:20,516 A:middle
out patterns of photos in
one different occasions

1853
01:39:20,516 --> 01:39:22,736 A:middle
or in a course we found like
we had the urge that we wanted

1854
01:39:22,736 --> 01:39:24,206 A:middle
to just tap in right from here.

1855
01:39:24,516 --> 01:39:26,576 A:middle
And so now in fact you can.

1856
01:39:27,116 --> 01:39:28,776 A:middle
You can just tap and scrub

1857
01:39:29,496 --> 01:39:32,356 A:middle
and find the photo you're
looking for just like that.

1858

It's really just amazing.

1859
01:39:33,876 --> 01:39:36,866 A:middle
So I can just pick a photo
here whichever one I want.

1860
01:39:37,346 --> 01:39:39,876 A:middle
It's kind of cute and
now we can edit it

1861
01:39:39,876 --> 01:39:41,106 A:middle
because we have photo filters.

1862
01:39:41,106 --> 01:39:42,506 A:middle
So I can go into
the filters here,

1863
01:39:42,886 --> 01:39:47,086 A:middle
I can try different color
effects, and if I find one I

1864
01:39:47,086 --> 01:39:49,036 A:middle
like maybe a nice
black and white,

1865
01:39:49,036 --> 01:39:50,496 A:middle
you can do it just like that.

1866
01:39:50,726 --> 01:39:52,586 A:middle
I'll apply it and
save that photo away.

1867

like it didn't leak,

so that's good you're not

1874
01:40:03,876 --> 01:40:06,416 A:middle
in there right now,
but you have AirDrop.

1875
01:40:06,546 --> 01:40:08,776 A:middle
You have access to other
photos, you can share them

1876
01:40:08,776 --> 01:40:10,826 A:middle
from right here,
just really handy.

And from here, I can
select the Photo Streams

that I want to share too.

1882

So I'm on family photos now,
but I'm going to drill in

and I can see other Photo
Streams I've set up.

And now, other people can share
into my Photo Stream as well.

really great experience

about your-- the voice of Siri.

Now there's yeah, a
couple of enterprise people

2096
01:52:03,846 --> 01:52:05,206 A:middle
in the audience are you?

2097
01:52:05,206 --> 01:52:08,026 A:middle
So, in addition to all of these
is one feature I want to talk

2098
01:52:08,026 --> 01:52:11,196 A:middle
about in a little bit more
detail which is activation lock.

2099
01:52:11,996 --> 01:52:16,636 A:middle
So hundreds of millions of
us use to Find My iPhone

2100
01:52:16,916 --> 01:52:19,886 A:middle
to find their phone when
it's just lost in the couch

2101
01:52:19,886 --> 01:52:23,276 A:middle
or maybe left at Starbucks,
but also when it's been stolen.

2102
01:52:24,556 --> 01:52:27,726 A:middle
And now, with activation
lock, if a thief tries

2103
01:52:27,756 --> 01:52:30,216 A:middle
to turn off Find My iPhone

2104
01:52:30,846 --> 01:52:35,166 A:middle
or if they even wipe the device
entirely, they will not be able

2105
01:52:35,256 --> 01:52:38,676 A:middle
to reactivate it because they
don't know your iPod user

2106
01:52:38,736 --> 01:52:39,626 A:middle
name activation.

We think this is going to be a
really powerful theft deterrent.

01:52:52,526 --> 01:52:55,046 A:middle
Now of course in addition
to be in a great release

2110
01:52:55,426 --> 01:52:59,326 A:middle
for our users, iOS 7 is also
a fantastic and major release

The SDK includes
over 1500 new APIs.

2114
01:53:04,176 --> 01:53:07,766 A:middle
We can add AirDrop, integrate it

2115
01:53:07,766 --> 01:53:09,596 A:middle
with third-party
game controllers.

2116
01:53:09,766 --> 01:53:12,416 A:middle
New APIs for taking
advantage of multitasking,

2117
01:53:12,986 --> 01:53:16,936 A:middle
iBeacons for Bluetooth
LE micro location,

2118
01:53:17,316 --> 01:53:21,226 A:middle
Sprite Kit for super fast
power-efficient game animations

2119
01:53:21,426 --> 01:53:27,336 A:middle
and UI dynamics to bring physics
to your UIView Animations.
