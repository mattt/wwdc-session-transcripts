00:00:00,506 --> 00:00:09,596 A:middle
[ Silence ]

2
00:00:10,096 --> 00:00:10,786 A:middle
>> Good morning.

3
00:00:11,526 --> 00:00:15,086 A:middle
Welcome. This is our
introduction session

4
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:17,966 A:middle
to using iAd Producer
to create content

5
00:00:18,016 --> 00:00:21,276 A:middle
for iBooks Author Widgets
and iAd rich media ads.

6
00:00:22,536 --> 00:00:23,666 A:middle
My name is Justin Voss.

7
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,506 A:middle
I'm an engineer on
the iAd Producer team.

8
00:00:26,156 --> 00:00:28,546 A:middle
And joining me later to give you
some really great demos will be

9
00:00:28,546 --> 00:00:30,756 A:middle
my co-worker Chris Shull
who's also an engineer

10
00:00:30,756 --> 00:00:31,626 A:middle
on the iAd Producer team.

11
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:35,126 A:middle
So here's what we're
going to talk about.

12
00:00:35,126 --> 00:00:39,856 A:middle
Like any good super hero, iAd
Producer has an origin story

13
00:00:40,136 --> 00:00:41,386 A:middle
and we'll share that
with you first.

14
00:00:43,196 --> 00:00:45,766 A:middle
Then we'll give you a quick
tour of the features of the app

15
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:49,066 A:middle
so you can get an idea of
what's available to you.

16
00:00:50,276 --> 00:00:52,936 A:middle
Then we'll dive deeper and we'll
show you how you can create

17
00:00:52,936 --> 00:00:54,816 A:middle
interactive content
without having

18
00:00:54,816 --> 00:00:56,706 A:middle
to write a single line of code.

19
00:00:58,116 --> 00:01:00,376 A:middle
Then we'll talk specifically
about some features

20
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

21
00:01:00,376 --> 00:01:02,126 A:middle
that are just for creating
iBooks Author Widgets.

22
00:01:03,586 --> 00:01:05,926 A:middle
And finally, we'll wrap up by
talking about some features

23
00:01:05,926 --> 00:01:08,776 A:middle
that are just for those of
you who are creating iAd ads.

24
00:01:09,156 --> 00:01:11,466 A:middle
So let's get started.

25
00:01:11,776 --> 00:01:13,886 A:middle
The first thing I
want to talk about is

26
00:01:13,886 --> 00:01:15,216 A:middle
where iAd Producer came from.

27
00:01:15,816 --> 00:01:18,476 A:middle
And I think some of you,
especially those of you here

28
00:01:18,476 --> 00:01:21,626 A:middle
that want to hear about iBooks,
are probably asking yourselves,

29
00:01:21,626 --> 00:01:24,476 A:middle
"Why am I going to talk about
this thing called iAd Producer,

30
00:01:24,846 --> 00:01:27,016 A:middle
what do iAds have
to do with iBooks?"

31
00:01:27,316 --> 00:01:28,096 A:middle
It's a really good question.

32
00:01:28,426 --> 00:01:32,236 A:middle
And to answer that question,
we'll go back to 2010

33
00:01:32,236 --> 00:01:33,946 A:middle
when iAd Producer
was first released.

34
00:01:34,316 --> 00:01:37,866 A:middle
Now, iAd Producer was
designed to be a great app

35
00:01:38,276 --> 00:01:41,336 A:middle
for creating interactive
rich media ads for iAd.

36
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:44,916 A:middle
And the interesting
thing about these ads is

37
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:46,426 A:middle
that they're actually
implemented

38
00:01:46,526 --> 00:01:47,606 A:middle
with web-based tools.

39
00:01:47,976 --> 00:01:50,626 A:middle
So under the hood, these
ads are actually bundles

40
00:01:50,626 --> 00:01:53,376 A:middle
of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

41
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:57,066 A:middle
And so by virtue of
being a really great app

42
00:01:57,156 --> 00:01:58,856 A:middle
for creating these ads,

43
00:01:59,006 --> 00:02:01,866 A:middle
iAd Producer is actually
a really great app

44
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

45
00:02:02,176 --> 00:02:03,646 A:middle
for producing content
for WebKit.

46
00:02:04,146 --> 00:02:07,496 A:middle
So we've got this
app, it's really great

47
00:02:07,496 --> 00:02:08,705 A:middle
at producing content for WebKit.

48
00:02:09,485 --> 00:02:11,086 A:middle
And we looked around
Apple and asked,

49
00:02:11,326 --> 00:02:13,486 A:middle
"Are there any other platforms
that could really benefit

50
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:15,646 A:middle
from having this
kind of an app?"

51
00:02:15,786 --> 00:02:17,316 A:middle
And it turns out,
the answer is yes.

52
00:02:17,926 --> 00:02:22,986 A:middle
So iBooks Author has a feature
that allows you to embed custom,

53
00:02:22,986 --> 00:02:24,706 A:middle
interactive widgets
into your books

54
00:02:25,286 --> 00:02:27,696 A:middle
and those widgets are
built with web-based tools

55
00:02:28,156 --> 00:02:29,886 A:middle
and they run inside WebKit.

56
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,976 A:middle
You also might be familiar
with iTunes LP and Extras.

57
00:02:34,326 --> 00:02:37,676 A:middle
These are interactive album
liner notes and movie extras

58
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:38,566 A:middle
and they're great way

59
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:40,466 A:middle
to experience your
music and movies.

60
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:42,446 A:middle
They're built with
web-based tools

61
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,626 A:middle
and they also run inside WebKit.

62
00:02:45,316 --> 00:02:47,776 A:middle
So we realized that if we
could take iAd Producer

63
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:50,976 A:middle
and tweak it just a little
bit, we could have one app

64
00:02:50,976 --> 00:02:53,646 A:middle
that can produce content for
all three of these platforms.

65
00:02:54,486 --> 00:02:56,186 A:middle
And with our latest
release of iAd Producer,

66
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,136 A:middle
that's exactly what we did.

67
00:02:59,356 --> 00:03:00,806 A:middle
So now, we can use iAd Producer

68
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

69
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,356 A:middle
to create these really great
interactive widgets for iBooks.

70
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:05,526 A:middle
You can see in the
screenshot here on the left,

71
00:03:05,526 --> 00:03:09,306 A:middle
I've got a widget that I'm
working on iAd Producer and then

72
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:11,196 A:middle
on the right, I'm
embedding that widget

73
00:03:11,296 --> 00:03:12,936 A:middle
into my book using
iBooks Author.

74
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:17,396 A:middle
I can create iTunes
LP and Extras.

75
00:03:17,396 --> 00:03:19,696 A:middle
You can see here in the
screenshot on the left,

76
00:03:19,696 --> 00:03:21,696 A:middle
I'm developing an
Extra in iAd producer

77
00:03:21,696 --> 00:03:24,146 A:middle
and then I'm running the
Extra in iTunes on the right.

78
00:03:24,146 --> 00:03:29,226 A:middle
And of course, you can
create ads for iAd.

79
00:03:29,226 --> 00:03:32,086 A:middle
You can see here, I'm designing
a banner in iAd Producer there

80
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,686 A:middle
on the left, and
then on the right,

81
00:03:33,686 --> 00:03:35,986 A:middle
that banner is actually
appearing on iOS device.

82
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:39,226 A:middle
So we've got one app
that can produce content

83
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,586 A:middle
for all three of
these platforms.

84
00:03:40,826 --> 00:03:43,146 A:middle
Yeah, thanks, yeah.

85
00:03:43,146 --> 00:03:44,726 A:middle
Let's get some applause.

86
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:45,586 A:middle
It's pretty cool,
right[applause]?

87
00:03:47,476 --> 00:03:47,846 A:middle
Thank you.

88
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:51,826 A:middle
OK, so that's the back
story behind iAd Producer.

89
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:54,876 A:middle
Now, I'd like to give you a
quick tour of the features

90
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:58,986 A:middle
so that you get an idea of, you
know, what's all in this app.

91
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

92
00:04:00,716 --> 00:04:02,556 A:middle
So when you first
launch iAd Producer,

93
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:05,366 A:middle
you'll see our project
picker and this is

94
00:04:05,366 --> 00:04:07,336 A:middle
where you can choose what
kind of project you're going

95
00:04:07,336 --> 00:04:08,936 A:middle
to be working on
and you can choose

96
00:04:08,936 --> 00:04:10,606 A:middle
from one of our templates.

97
00:04:10,686 --> 00:04:12,786 A:middle
You can see at the top of the
window, I've got this tab bar

98
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,026 A:middle
and that's where I choose
what kind of project I want

99
00:04:15,026 --> 00:04:17,706 A:middle
to create, whether I want
to create something for iAd,

100
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:21,266 A:middle
iTunes LP, iTunes Extras,
or iBooks Author Widgets.

101
00:04:21,935 --> 00:04:25,226 A:middle
And below that, you can
see some of our templates.

102
00:04:26,216 --> 00:04:28,586 A:middle
Our templates are starter
projects that have a little bit

103
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:29,796 A:middle
of structure already in them

104
00:04:29,976 --> 00:04:32,186 A:middle
so that your project will really
get off on the right foot.

105
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,986 A:middle
We've got templates for
iAd like you can see here.

106
00:04:34,986 --> 00:04:39,456 A:middle
Here are some of our templates
for iTunes LPs, some templates

107
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:46,006 A:middle
for Extras, and some
templates for our widgets.

108
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:47,936 A:middle
When you go to create your
content in iAd Producer,

109
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,576 A:middle
you'll turn to the Object
Library to find a lot

110
00:04:50,576 --> 00:04:53,026 A:middle
of really great prebuilt
views and controls

111
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,906 A:middle
that you can bring
right into your project,

112
00:04:55,126 --> 00:05:00,106 A:middle
and we'll talk a lot more
about this in just a minute.

113
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

114
00:05:00,196 --> 00:05:01,996 A:middle
Also, while you're creating your
project, you're going to bring

115
00:05:01,996 --> 00:05:02,996 A:middle
in a lot of your own images

116
00:05:02,996 --> 00:05:05,376 A:middle
and your own video
files and audio files.

117
00:05:05,766 --> 00:05:08,056 A:middle
And to import and manage
all those resources,

118
00:05:08,246 --> 00:05:09,326 A:middle
you'll use the Asset Library.

119
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:14,266 A:middle
As you get more objects
on your page,

120
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:16,336 A:middle
the Layer List can be
a really helpful tool

121
00:05:16,336 --> 00:05:17,606 A:middle
to help manage all of that.

122
00:05:18,126 --> 00:05:20,306 A:middle
You can quickly navigate to
the object you're looking for

123
00:05:20,546 --> 00:05:22,466 A:middle
and you can rearrange how
they're stacked visually

124
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:23,106 A:middle
on the page.

125
00:05:23,546 --> 00:05:25,036 A:middle
This is a lot like the
layer list you might find

126
00:05:25,036 --> 00:05:26,466 A:middle
in an image editor
like Photoshop.

127
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:31,826 A:middle
When you add custom
interactivity to your project,

128
00:05:32,116 --> 00:05:34,716 A:middle
the Action List is where
you can find all the actions

129
00:05:34,716 --> 00:05:36,646 A:middle
that are applicable to the
currently selected object.

130
00:05:37,096 --> 00:05:41,256 A:middle
And then to customize the
objects you already have

131
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:44,276 A:middle
on your page, the Inspectors are
where you can adjust all kinds

132
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:46,176 A:middle
of things like giving
those objects names.

133
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,536 A:middle
You can fine-tune their
position on the page,

134
00:05:48,746 --> 00:05:51,276 A:middle
and you could adjust a lot
of their visual properties

135
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:52,856 A:middle
as well along with a
lot of other things.

136
00:05:53,276 --> 00:06:00,096 A:middle
And finally, we have a powerful
but easy to use animation system

137
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

138
00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:02,316 A:middle
and this Action List sidebar is

139
00:06:02,316 --> 00:06:03,886 A:middle
where you can control
all of those.

140
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:08,036 A:middle
You can create precisely timed
groups of actions and animations

141
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:09,026 A:middle
and organize all of that here.

142
00:06:09,026 --> 00:06:13,506 A:middle
OK, so that's a pretty
brief tour

143
00:06:13,736 --> 00:06:15,456 A:middle
of the major features
of iAd Producer.

144
00:06:15,946 --> 00:06:17,356 A:middle
Let's dive deeper and talk

145
00:06:17,356 --> 00:06:20,116 A:middle
about how you can actually
create the interactive content

146
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:23,076 A:middle
you're looking for without
having to write any custom code.

147
00:06:23,706 --> 00:06:26,276 A:middle
And it all starts with objects.

148
00:06:27,436 --> 00:06:28,546 A:middle
So this is the Object Library

149
00:06:28,546 --> 00:06:29,886 A:middle
that I just showed
you a few minutes ago.

150
00:06:30,476 --> 00:06:34,216 A:middle
It's full of a lot of
prebuilt views and controls

151
00:06:34,216 --> 00:06:37,036 A:middle
that you can bring into your
project, and they breakdown

152
00:06:37,036 --> 00:06:38,116 A:middle
to a couple categories.

153
00:06:38,586 --> 00:06:40,796 A:middle
There's a general category.

154
00:06:41,296 --> 00:06:42,236 A:middle
This includes all

155
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,636 A:middle
of the standard controls
you might expect.

156
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:44,576 A:middle
Those things like buttons

157
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:46,616 A:middle
and image views,
labels, scroll views.

158
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,716 A:middle
There's a media category.

159
00:06:49,846 --> 00:06:52,386 A:middle
This is where you'll find audio
players and video players.

160
00:06:52,906 --> 00:06:55,936 A:middle
If we scroll down a little bit,
we'll see the other categories

161
00:06:56,446 --> 00:06:57,876 A:middle
like the multi-cell category.

162
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,666 A:middle
This category has objects that
are collections of other views.

163
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

164
00:07:02,026 --> 00:07:05,556 A:middle
So we've got things like a cover
flow view, we've got a carousel,

165
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:07,516 A:middle
panoramas, image galleries,

166
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:08,766 A:middle
a lot of really cool
stuff in here.

167
00:07:09,276 --> 00:07:14,516 A:middle
And finally, there's a dynamic
category and these are objects

168
00:07:14,546 --> 00:07:16,986 A:middle
that can be populated
with content at runtime.

169
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:20,416 A:middle
So to give you an example,
there's a drawing object in here

170
00:07:20,636 --> 00:07:22,876 A:middle
where when the user is
actually running your project,

171
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,906 A:middle
they can use their fingertip to
draw something on the screen.

172
00:07:25,226 --> 00:07:26,426 A:middle
It's pretty neat.

173
00:07:29,476 --> 00:07:31,516 A:middle
So now that you got your
objects in your page,

174
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:33,876 A:middle
you want to start hooking
some action or some, you know,

175
00:07:33,876 --> 00:07:35,536 A:middle
interactivity up
to those objects,

176
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:37,896 A:middle
and that will start with events.

177
00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:39,966 A:middle
Events are user interaction.

178
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:41,806 A:middle
So an event might
be the user tapping

179
00:07:41,806 --> 00:07:44,036 A:middle
on a button or dragging
a slider.

180
00:07:45,326 --> 00:07:49,246 A:middle
And by listening for and
responding to these events,

181
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:52,066 A:middle
you can get a lot of the
benefits of custom code

182
00:07:52,256 --> 00:07:53,916 A:middle
without actually
having to write any.

183
00:07:54,806 --> 00:07:57,876 A:middle
So let me give you a more
concrete example of that.

184
00:07:57,876 --> 00:07:59,226 A:middle
You can see in my
screenshot here,

185
00:07:59,556 --> 00:08:00,646 A:middle
I've a got a button selected.

186
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

187
00:08:01,796 --> 00:08:04,766 A:middle
And I've got a zoomed in
screenshot of our Inspector.

188
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:07,506 A:middle
And specifically, we're
looking at the Events Inspector.

189
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:10,506 A:middle
And this part that
says, Activated.

190
00:08:11,606 --> 00:08:13,326 A:middle
Activated is the
name of the event

191
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,316 A:middle
that we're interested in here.

192
00:08:14,556 --> 00:08:16,736 A:middle
Activated is the event that
happens when the user taps on

193
00:08:16,736 --> 00:08:17,666 A:middle
or clicks on a button.

194
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:20,776 A:middle
And in this particular
case, I've set it up so

195
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:22,506 A:middle
that when this button
is activated,

196
00:08:22,506 --> 00:08:25,006 A:middle
we're going to run
the Go to Page action

197
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,446 A:middle
which will take the user to
another page in the project.

198
00:08:27,446 --> 00:08:30,616 A:middle
And specifically, we want to go
to a page called Lander Game.

199
00:08:31,156 --> 00:08:34,346 A:middle
And so that's how easy it is
to configure a custom action

200
00:08:34,706 --> 00:08:37,916 A:middle
to be associated
with this event.

201
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,576 A:middle
You're not limited
to just one action.

202
00:08:39,956 --> 00:08:43,316 A:middle
If you want, you can also
trigger an entire action list

203
00:08:43,316 --> 00:08:45,796 A:middle
so you have multiple
animations or multiple actions.

204
00:08:46,296 --> 00:08:50,446 A:middle
And if you wish, you can also
provide some custom JavaScript

205
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,066 A:middle
code and when the
event is triggered,

206
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:55,936 A:middle
we'll run that code for you.

207
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,156 A:middle
We've got a lot of great actions
that you can choose from.

208
00:08:58,346 --> 00:09:00,426 A:middle
I want to highlight some of
the interesting ones for you.

209
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

210
00:09:01,116 --> 00:09:03,046 A:middle
We already talked about
the action that allows you

211
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:05,536 A:middle
to navigate between different
pages within your project.

212
00:09:05,976 --> 00:09:10,436 A:middle
You can also control other
objects that are on the page.

213
00:09:10,436 --> 00:09:12,396 A:middle
So this is really great if
you have an image gallery

214
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:13,536 A:middle
and you want to control

215
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:15,446 A:middle
which image is the front
most one in your gallery.

216
00:09:15,976 --> 00:09:20,116 A:middle
We can play or pause
audio or video.

217
00:09:20,636 --> 00:09:26,386 A:middle
We can open URLs and
we can prompt the user

218
00:09:26,386 --> 00:09:29,196 A:middle
to compose content like writing
a tweet or composing an email.

219
00:09:29,196 --> 00:09:30,686 A:middle
So there are a lot of
things to choose from.

220
00:09:30,686 --> 00:09:36,306 A:middle
There's a lot more than what
we talked about just now.

221
00:09:36,546 --> 00:09:39,426 A:middle
We also have a powerful but
easy to use animation system.

222
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,716 A:middle
So this is how you can create
all those fluid animations

223
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:45,316 A:middle
that your users expect
from iOS and there's a lot

224
00:09:45,316 --> 00:09:47,066 A:middle
of different things that
you can animate about all

225
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:48,366 A:middle
of the objects you
have on your page.

226
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:55,426 A:middle
So for example, you can animate
its position, the opacity,

227
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:01,136 A:middle
the rotation, and the scale.

228
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

229
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,786 A:middle
And those are just a few of
the things you can animate.

230
00:10:04,786 --> 00:10:07,996 A:middle
There's a lot more.

231
00:10:08,396 --> 00:10:11,256 A:middle
So as you create these
animations or you want

232
00:10:11,256 --> 00:10:14,346 A:middle
to have more than one action
that starts as, you know,

233
00:10:14,676 --> 00:10:17,086 A:middle
triggered by an event,
you use action lists.

234
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:20,936 A:middle
And these are precisely-timed
groups of actions and animations

235
00:10:21,236 --> 00:10:23,556 A:middle
and you can group them together
so that some happen together

236
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,666 A:middle
or these happen in sequence.

237
00:10:25,086 --> 00:10:27,036 A:middle
You can mix actions
and animations.

238
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:28,556 A:middle
You've got a lot of
really great options here.

239
00:10:29,986 --> 00:10:30,766 A:middle
So to give you an example,

240
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:33,666 A:middle
you can see the spaceship
has this complex sequence

241
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,916 A:middle
of animations it does.

242
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:39,026 A:middle
One really great use for
these are page builds.

243
00:10:39,226 --> 00:10:41,306 A:middle
So the same way that in
this Keynote presentation,

244
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:42,876 A:middle
all of these objects
are animating

245
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,436 A:middle
on to the slide as it appears.

246
00:10:44,706 --> 00:10:46,726 A:middle
You can do basically the
same thing in iAd Producer.

247
00:10:46,986 --> 00:10:48,986 A:middle
So you can have animations
that happen as soon

248
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,126 A:middle
as the user visits the page.

249
00:10:50,636 --> 00:10:54,796 A:middle
And to give you a demo of how
all these objects, actions,

250
00:10:54,796 --> 00:10:56,096 A:middle
and animations come together,

251
00:10:56,326 --> 00:10:58,036 A:middle
I'd like to invite Chris
to give you a demo.

252
00:10:58,226 --> 00:10:58,516 A:middle
Chris?

253
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:03,636 A:middle
[ Applause ]

254
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

255
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:04,796 A:middle
>> Thank you, Justin.

256
00:11:05,216 --> 00:11:07,316 A:middle
For my first demo today,

257
00:11:07,456 --> 00:11:09,466 A:middle
I want to show you how you
can build some really great,

258
00:11:09,706 --> 00:11:12,066 A:middle
rich interactive content
with iAd Producer.

259
00:11:13,426 --> 00:11:16,416 A:middle
Let's say that you're
writing a book about animals

260
00:11:16,766 --> 00:11:20,066 A:middle
and in your book, you want
to have an interactive widget

261
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:22,746 A:middle
that has a cover flow
of those animals.

262
00:11:24,006 --> 00:11:27,266 A:middle
Well, I have built just
such a widget for today.

263
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:29,646 A:middle
And let's take a
quick look at it

264
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:31,096 A:middle
and then together we're
going to build it.

265
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:35,246 A:middle
I'll use iAd Producer's built-in
previewing functionality.

266
00:11:36,616 --> 00:11:39,766 A:middle
And the first thing that you're
going to see is animating

267
00:11:40,236 --> 00:11:43,886 A:middle
in that big cover flow filling
up almost the entire widget

268
00:11:44,736 --> 00:11:48,426 A:middle
and it has the interaction that
you would expect from a widget.

269
00:11:48,426 --> 00:11:54,226 A:middle
The ability to swipe it, tap it
to jump to a particular image.

270
00:11:54,726 --> 00:11:57,946 A:middle
And there's also these two
buttons in the bottom left

271
00:11:57,946 --> 00:12:01,006 A:middle
and right hand corners
to let me simply cycle

272
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

273
00:12:01,006 --> 00:12:05,036 A:middle
through which image is
focused in this cover flow one

274
00:12:05,036 --> 00:12:07,446 A:middle
at a time, forward
and backwards.

275
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:10,286 A:middle
So this is where we're heading.

276
00:12:10,826 --> 00:12:12,296 A:middle
I'm going to close this
now and we're going

277
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:13,166 A:middle
to build it from scratch.

278
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:20,946 A:middle
I'm going to build this
widget in four stages.

279
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:25,536 A:middle
In the first stage, I'm going to
add that cover flow to my widget

280
00:12:26,026 --> 00:12:27,666 A:middle
and I'm going to
populate it with images.

281
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:31,016 A:middle
In the second stage, I'm going

282
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,036 A:middle
to provide some styling
to my page.

283
00:12:33,506 --> 00:12:36,156 A:middle
I'm also going to add some
buttons and style them as well.

284
00:12:37,536 --> 00:12:40,536 A:middle
In the third stage, I'm
going to connect some actions

285
00:12:40,536 --> 00:12:44,526 A:middle
to those buttons to make it so
that the cover flow will cycle

286
00:12:44,526 --> 00:12:45,896 A:middle
through like we just saw.

287
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:49,456 A:middle
And in the fourth stage, I'm
going to add a little bit

288
00:12:49,456 --> 00:12:50,656 A:middle
of animation to my project.

289
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:54,536 A:middle
So let's get started.

290
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:58,546 A:middle
This is what you see when you
first launch iAd Producer.

291
00:12:58,796 --> 00:13:01,166 A:middle
We have those four
categories up at the top,

292
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

293
00:13:01,786 --> 00:13:03,326 A:middle
which project type
we're going to choose.

294
00:13:04,146 --> 00:13:06,946 A:middle
And today, we're going to
choose iBooks Author Widget.

295
00:13:08,176 --> 00:13:10,526 A:middle
Everything I'm about
to show applies to all

296
00:13:10,526 --> 00:13:12,356 A:middle
of these different
kinds of projects

297
00:13:12,856 --> 00:13:15,936 A:middle
but because we're writing a
book today, I'm going to go

298
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:17,076 A:middle
with a widget project.

299
00:13:17,716 --> 00:13:20,246 A:middle
We also have all these
templates to choose from.

300
00:13:20,856 --> 00:13:24,246 A:middle
But I want to show just how
easy it is to use iAd Producer

301
00:13:24,246 --> 00:13:25,886 A:middle
to build content from scratch.

302
00:13:25,886 --> 00:13:27,896 A:middle
So I'm going to choose
a blank template.

303
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:31,586 A:middle
It's already selected so
I'm just going to down

304
00:13:31,586 --> 00:13:33,136 A:middle
to the bottom right
and choose Select.

305
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:37,996 A:middle
This loads in a new
iAd Producer project,

306
00:13:38,216 --> 00:13:40,386 A:middle
completely blank,
save for one page.

307
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,896 A:middle
So I'm going to open up that
page to start editing it just

308
00:13:43,896 --> 00:13:45,386 A:middle
by double-clicking on it.

309
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:50,556 A:middle
I want to get that cover flow
onto my page and to do that,

310
00:13:50,556 --> 00:13:52,376 A:middle
I'm going to open up
my Object Library.

311
00:13:53,236 --> 00:13:56,226 A:middle
There's a toolbar button for
that on the left-hand side

312
00:13:56,596 --> 00:13:57,636 A:middle
of the toolbar in the bottom.

313
00:13:58,226 --> 00:14:01,046 A:middle
Here, we see all those objects

314
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

315
00:14:01,146 --> 00:14:02,816 A:middle
that Justin was talking
about earlier.

316
00:14:03,216 --> 00:14:06,976 A:middle
We have our general
objects, our media objects,

317
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:13,626 A:middle
our multi-cell objects, and
our dynamic content objects.

318
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:19,066 A:middle
Today, because my cover-- my
widget features a cover flow,

319
00:14:19,296 --> 00:14:23,296 A:middle
I'm going to add a cover flow
to my page simply by dragging

320
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,366 A:middle
and dropping it where I want it.

321
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,226 A:middle
This isn't quite the size
I want so what I'm going

322
00:14:29,226 --> 00:14:31,596 A:middle
to do is I'm going resize
it by dragging on one

323
00:14:31,596 --> 00:14:33,546 A:middle
of the blue resizing handles.

324
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,936 A:middle
You might be familiar with if
you've used Keynote before,

325
00:14:37,706 --> 00:14:38,846 A:middle
many other Mac apps.

326
00:14:39,406 --> 00:14:42,046 A:middle
Now, pay close attention here

327
00:14:42,046 --> 00:14:45,546 A:middle
because we also have these
great snapping guides.

328
00:14:46,556 --> 00:14:48,646 A:middle
Yellow one you see there in
the center of the screen,

329
00:14:48,826 --> 00:14:51,966 A:middle
it's helping me make sure I
get my content just the way I

330
00:14:51,966 --> 00:14:52,346 A:middle
want it.

331
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:53,716 A:middle
Extremely useful.

332
00:14:54,266 --> 00:14:57,626 A:middle
So now, I have it
the size I want.

333
00:14:58,306 --> 00:15:01,016 A:middle
It's time to get images
into this cover flow.

334
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

335
00:15:01,696 --> 00:15:03,046 A:middle
Before I can do that though,

336
00:15:03,046 --> 00:15:04,946 A:middle
I need to get the
images into my project.

337
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:09,656 A:middle
I'm going to open up our Asset
Library panel by clicking

338
00:15:09,656 --> 00:15:13,426 A:middle
on the Assets button on the
toolbar and I'm then going

339
00:15:13,426 --> 00:15:15,286 A:middle
to click Import in that panel.

340
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:18,606 A:middle
I'm going to navigate
to my photos.

341
00:15:19,526 --> 00:15:21,756 A:middle
And before I bring
these photos in,

342
00:15:22,126 --> 00:15:24,986 A:middle
I want to point out something.

343
00:15:24,986 --> 00:15:28,546 A:middle
For every image I have, for
example, this butterfly image,

344
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,236 A:middle
I have a pair of assets.

345
00:15:30,686 --> 00:15:32,516 A:middle
I have my standard
resolution JPEG

346
00:15:32,886 --> 00:15:36,746 A:middle
and I have my retina
resolution @2x JPEG.

347
00:15:37,346 --> 00:15:39,716 A:middle
It's very important to have
a naming scheme like this.

348
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:41,246 A:middle
This is what iAd
Producer is expecting.

349
00:15:41,706 --> 00:15:43,976 A:middle
And if you've done
Cocoa development before

350
00:15:44,116 --> 00:15:46,466 A:middle
for retina displays, this
should be familiar to you.

351
00:15:46,466 --> 00:15:51,606 A:middle
So I'm going to select all these
images that I've pre-created

352
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:53,906 A:middle
and choose to import them.

353
00:15:54,446 --> 00:15:58,086 A:middle
And at this point, you'll
notice that that pair

354
00:15:58,086 --> 00:16:02,536 A:middle
of images is now a single
listing in our Asset Library.

355
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

356
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:06,056 A:middle
This is because from here on
out, iAd Producer is going

357
00:16:06,056 --> 00:16:08,116 A:middle
to take care of the retina

358
00:16:08,186 --> 00:16:10,766 A:middle
versus standard resolution
displays and images for you.

359
00:16:10,856 --> 00:16:13,176 A:middle
It's going to make sure
the right image ends

360
00:16:13,176 --> 00:16:14,136 A:middle
up on the right display.

361
00:16:14,646 --> 00:16:16,686 A:middle
If you've done traditional
web development before

362
00:16:16,686 --> 00:16:18,526 A:middle
where you've had to deal with
this yourself, this is going

363
00:16:18,526 --> 00:16:19,846 A:middle
to be a huge time saver.

364
00:16:20,636 --> 00:16:24,236 A:middle
If you really want to make sure
you have both resolution images,

365
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,146 A:middle
you can look up at the
top of that Asset Library

366
00:16:27,356 --> 00:16:31,356 A:middle
and you can see I have both my
1x and 2x versions of my image.

367
00:16:31,776 --> 00:16:35,806 A:middle
OK, enough about retina
versus standard resolution.

368
00:16:36,316 --> 00:16:39,146 A:middle
Let's get these images
in my cover flow.

369
00:16:39,146 --> 00:16:42,786 A:middle
So I'm going to select
all my images and drag

370
00:16:42,786 --> 00:16:46,046 A:middle
and drop onto my cover flow.

371
00:16:46,246 --> 00:16:49,986 A:middle
Just like that, populated
cover flow with all my images.

372
00:16:50,516 --> 00:16:56,026 A:middle
At this point, let's
take a second and see

373
00:16:56,026 --> 00:16:57,066 A:middle
where we are in our project.

374
00:16:57,066 --> 00:17:00,226 A:middle
I'm going to use iAd Producer's
built-in Quick Preview

375
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

376
00:17:00,226 --> 00:17:02,746 A:middle
functionality to get
an interactive preview

377
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:03,566 A:middle
of my widget.

378
00:17:03,996 --> 00:17:06,386 A:middle
We do this with the
Preview button

379
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:10,925 A:middle
in the center of the toolbar.

380
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:13,626 A:middle
Here, I can interact with
my widget and you'll notice

381
00:17:13,626 --> 00:17:17,656 A:middle
that that cover flow has not
only the images we added to it

382
00:17:18,156 --> 00:17:21,316 A:middle
but has all the interactivity
that we would expect

383
00:17:21,465 --> 00:17:25,736 A:middle
from a cover flow, the
ability to swipe and tap.

384
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:28,306 A:middle
Comes for free with the
cover flow, you don't have

385
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:30,166 A:middle
to do anything extra
to get that.

386
00:17:31,456 --> 00:17:34,356 A:middle
All right, so I've added
my cover flow to my page,

387
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:36,206 A:middle
that's the first stage.

388
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:39,276 A:middle
Let's go on to the second
stage and style my page,

389
00:17:39,796 --> 00:17:41,476 A:middle
add some buttons, and
style them as well.

390
00:17:42,086 --> 00:17:43,876 A:middle
I'm going to close Quick Preview

391
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:46,186 A:middle
by hitting the Close
button in the top left.

392
00:17:46,716 --> 00:17:49,576 A:middle
And I'm going to
deselect my cover flow

393
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:53,066 A:middle
so that I can style my
page itself because I want

394
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:54,156 A:middle
to change its background
to black.

395
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:58,156 A:middle
So I'm just going to click away
from my cover flow by clicking

396
00:17:58,156 --> 00:18:03,486 A:middle
on the background of my page and
open up the Inspector in the--

397
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

398
00:18:03,706 --> 00:18:05,976 A:middle
by using the toolbar
button in the bottom right.

399
00:18:07,376 --> 00:18:09,906 A:middle
Here is where we can
set all the settings

400
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:13,686 A:middle
about a particular object
or because right now,

401
00:18:13,686 --> 00:18:15,736 A:middle
we have nothing selected,
the page itself.

402
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:19,016 A:middle
So what I'm going do is I'm
going to change the background

403
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:19,956 A:middle
of this page to black.

404
00:18:19,956 --> 00:18:22,366 A:middle
I'm going to open up the
Background Inspector,

405
00:18:23,156 --> 00:18:24,436 A:middle
switch from None to Color.

406
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:30,236 A:middle
I'm just going to click on this
color well and choose black.

407
00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:32,386 A:middle
There we go.

408
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:34,086 A:middle
I think this is looking
a lot better.

409
00:18:35,426 --> 00:18:37,146 A:middle
Let's get those buttons
on the page.

410
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,336 A:middle
Just like I did before with my
cover flow, I'm going to open

411
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:44,726 A:middle
up my Objects Library,
scroll up to the top

412
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:50,206 A:middle
and drag a button onto the page.

413
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:53,676 A:middle
This one is going to
be my next button.

414
00:18:53,836 --> 00:18:56,736 A:middle
This button doesn't quite fit in
with the color scheme I'm going

415
00:18:56,776 --> 00:19:00,156 A:middle
for with this page, so let's
change some of its styles.

416
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

417
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,556 A:middle
You notice now that I
have the button selected,

418
00:19:02,816 --> 00:19:04,936 A:middle
the Inspector is the
Buttons Inspector

419
00:19:05,396 --> 00:19:08,666 A:middle
and I have all the options that
I can change about that button.

420
00:19:08,776 --> 00:19:12,286 A:middle
So just going to go through
and the first thing I'm going

421
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:20,096 A:middle
to do is I'm going to change the
text to white and I'm also going

422
00:19:20,096 --> 00:19:26,246 A:middle
to change the background,
again to a color, and black.

423
00:19:26,306 --> 00:19:29,596 A:middle
I'm also going to tweak
the border of this button.

424
00:19:30,056 --> 00:19:32,026 A:middle
I'm going to make the width

425
00:19:32,026 --> 00:19:34,286 A:middle
of the border a little
bit stronger.

426
00:19:34,286 --> 00:19:38,166 A:middle
I'm going to get rid of the
radius and I'm also going

427
00:19:38,966 --> 00:19:40,336 A:middle
to make its border
white as well.

428
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:44,506 A:middle
So here is how our
button is going to look

429
00:19:44,506 --> 00:19:48,466 A:middle
like when the user is just
looking at this page normally,

430
00:19:49,336 --> 00:19:50,396 A:middle
but as some of you may know,

431
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:52,666 A:middle
buttons have more
than just one state.

432
00:19:52,746 --> 00:19:54,326 A:middle
They have multiple states.

433
00:19:54,896 --> 00:19:58,836 A:middle
So for example, when a user is
actively tapping on a button

434
00:19:58,836 --> 00:20:02,156 A:middle
and pressing down on it, we
often see a visual feedback

435
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

436
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:05,446 A:middle
for that button so
that user knows

437
00:20:05,446 --> 00:20:07,366 A:middle
that they are correctly
tapping on that button.

438
00:20:08,046 --> 00:20:09,706 A:middle
We call this the
highlighted state.

439
00:20:09,706 --> 00:20:11,796 A:middle
So what I'm going to do
now is I'm also going

440
00:20:11,796 --> 00:20:12,956 A:middle
to change my highlighted state.

441
00:20:13,496 --> 00:20:16,436 A:middle
To do that, I'm going
to switch from Normal

442
00:20:16,546 --> 00:20:18,046 A:middle
to Highlighted in the Inspector.

443
00:20:18,876 --> 00:20:20,936 A:middle
We can see what that
button is going to look

444
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:23,796 A:middle
like in the highlighted state.

445
00:20:24,276 --> 00:20:28,836 A:middle
And so I'm just going to quickly
change the styles for that state

446
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,576 A:middle
to be something that's going

447
00:20:30,576 --> 00:20:32,726 A:middle
to give good visual
feedback to my user.

448
00:20:34,096 --> 00:20:36,946 A:middle
So I'm going to switch to this
from Gradient to Color again.

449
00:20:37,776 --> 00:20:40,566 A:middle
This time, I'm just going to
make it blue instead of black.

450
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:46,156 A:middle
And I'm also going to make sure
that in the highlighted state,

451
00:20:46,486 --> 00:20:48,876 A:middle
the border of my
button is still white.

452
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:53,476 A:middle
OK, now my button is
still labeled Button

453
00:20:54,236 --> 00:20:55,546 A:middle
and so the last thing
I'm going to do

454
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:59,106 A:middle
to give this button the
correct visual appearance is

455
00:20:59,106 --> 00:20:59,736 A:middle
to relabel it.

456
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:04,016 A:middle
I'm just going to double-click
on the text and now that I'm

457
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

458
00:21:04,016 --> 00:21:05,206 A:middle
in text editing mode,

459
00:21:05,466 --> 00:21:11,966 A:middle
I can simply type
Next, just like that.

460
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:15,476 A:middle
So my button happens to
be-- this next button,

461
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:18,146 A:middle
happens to be nearly identical
to my previous button.

462
00:21:18,406 --> 00:21:19,536 A:middle
It just has a different label.

463
00:21:20,086 --> 00:21:22,136 A:middle
So I'm going to actually
duplicate this button

464
00:21:22,356 --> 00:21:23,906 A:middle
so that I don't have
to do all that work all

465
00:21:23,906 --> 00:21:25,696 A:middle
over again to get those styles.

466
00:21:26,336 --> 00:21:28,486 A:middle
With the button selected, I'm
just going to go up to Edit,

467
00:21:29,366 --> 00:21:32,786 A:middle
duplicate, and there I
have my duplicated button.

468
00:21:34,036 --> 00:21:37,706 A:middle
Move it over to where I want my
previous button to be and just

469
00:21:37,706 --> 00:21:41,236 A:middle
like I did before, to
label my other button next,

470
00:21:41,286 --> 00:21:45,106 A:middle
I'm going to double-click on the
text and change it to Previous.

471
00:21:49,236 --> 00:21:51,596 A:middle
So this is at my
second my stage.

472
00:21:52,236 --> 00:21:53,936 A:middle
I've gotten these buttons
down and I've styled them.

473
00:21:54,216 --> 00:21:57,276 A:middle
We'll take another moment and
check in with Quick Preview

474
00:21:57,276 --> 00:22:02,406 A:middle
to make sure everything is just
working the way I want it to.

475
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

476
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:06,456 A:middle
You can see my cover flow is
now in that black background.

477
00:22:07,316 --> 00:22:10,556 A:middle
And while the buttons aren't
doing anything yet, they do have

478
00:22:10,556 --> 00:22:13,166 A:middle
that visual feedback
when I'm tapping on them.

479
00:22:13,786 --> 00:22:17,206 A:middle
So the user knows that they are
actually tapping on the button.

480
00:22:17,876 --> 00:22:22,916 A:middle
OK, so at this point,
I'm halfway through.

481
00:22:23,256 --> 00:22:24,616 A:middle
I've added my cover flow.

482
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:25,936 A:middle
I've added my styles.

483
00:22:26,326 --> 00:22:30,136 A:middle
It's time to actually have some
custom interaction inside this

484
00:22:30,136 --> 00:22:32,566 A:middle
widget so I'm going to add
some actions to these buttons.

485
00:22:34,596 --> 00:22:35,716 A:middle
Close Quick Preview.

486
00:22:36,436 --> 00:22:40,526 A:middle
I'm going to select my previous
button and now what I'm going

487
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,136 A:middle
to do is I'm going to open
up the Actions Library

488
00:22:43,176 --> 00:22:46,536 A:middle
in iAd Producer by
using the button

489
00:22:46,756 --> 00:22:48,946 A:middle
in the toolbar on the left.

490
00:22:49,656 --> 00:22:53,806 A:middle
Here, I see all of the actions
that this button can trigger

491
00:22:54,056 --> 00:22:56,936 A:middle
when someone taps on
it or clicks on it.

492
00:22:57,136 --> 00:23:00,286 A:middle
What I'm going to use today
is the Focus Cell action

493
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

494
00:23:00,426 --> 00:23:02,236 A:middle
because this is the action
that's going to let me,

495
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:04,146 A:middle
when someone taps
on this button,

496
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,206 A:middle
cycle through the cells
of that cover flow.

497
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:11,486 A:middle
With this selected, I have this
plus button and I'm just going

498
00:23:11,486 --> 00:23:15,296 A:middle
to click this and before I click
it, I want you to be looking

499
00:23:15,296 --> 00:23:18,686 A:middle
at the Inspector for the
button because at the bottom

500
00:23:18,686 --> 00:23:22,136 A:middle
of that Inspector when I
click it, iAd Producer adds

501
00:23:22,636 --> 00:23:26,896 A:middle
in that Events Inspector
that Focus Cell action.

502
00:23:27,086 --> 00:23:30,056 A:middle
It's automatically connected
to my flow view and it's,

503
00:23:30,306 --> 00:23:32,546 A:middle
by default, set up to
go on to the next cell.

504
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:34,956 A:middle
I'm actually going
to change this

505
00:23:35,176 --> 00:23:37,136 A:middle
because this is my
previous button.

506
00:23:37,796 --> 00:23:40,236 A:middle
So instead of going
to the next cell,

507
00:23:40,326 --> 00:23:41,386 A:middle
I'm going to the previous cell.

508
00:23:41,876 --> 00:23:46,556 A:middle
I'm just going to repeat that
process with my next button

509
00:23:46,706 --> 00:23:49,576 A:middle
so it also has that
action associated with it.

510
00:23:50,266 --> 00:23:52,386 A:middle
So I'm going to select it.

511
00:23:52,386 --> 00:23:53,236 A:middle
Once again, I'm going to click

512
00:23:53,236 --> 00:23:55,626 A:middle
on the plus button
under focus cell.

513
00:23:56,286 --> 00:24:00,146 A:middle
iAd Producer adds that
to Events and this time,

514
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

515
00:24:01,426 --> 00:24:02,866 A:middle
I do have my next button here.

516
00:24:02,866 --> 00:24:04,626 A:middle
I do want it to go
on to the next cell

517
00:24:05,006 --> 00:24:07,936 A:middle
so there's nothing else to do.

518
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,836 A:middle
Let's check in with Quick
Preview again and make sure

519
00:24:11,026 --> 00:24:12,846 A:middle
that I've correctly
rigged those buttons

520
00:24:13,256 --> 00:24:14,936 A:middle
to be just the way I want them.

521
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:20,846 A:middle
Here, we have it and
not only are we getting

522
00:24:20,846 --> 00:24:25,166 A:middle
that visual feedback when I'm
tapping on the buttons but just

523
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:28,716 A:middle
as we wanted, that cover flow is
cycling through those cells one

524
00:24:28,716 --> 00:24:30,356 A:middle
by one, forwards and backwards.

525
00:24:30,356 --> 00:24:34,796 A:middle
So that was the third stage.

526
00:24:34,796 --> 00:24:37,866 A:middle
For the fourth and final
stage of building this widget,

527
00:24:38,406 --> 00:24:42,766 A:middle
I'm going to add a
little bit of animation.

528
00:24:42,766 --> 00:24:46,886 A:middle
Closing Quick Preview and what
I want to do if you recall back

529
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:50,746 A:middle
to that widget I showed you
earlier, I want that cover flow

530
00:24:50,846 --> 00:24:53,656 A:middle
to animate in from
the top into place.

531
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:56,836 A:middle
So I'm going to select
this cover flow.

532
00:24:57,396 --> 00:25:00,306 A:middle
I'm going to open up
my Action Lists panel.

533
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

534
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:03,556 A:middle
It's done by clicking on
the Action Lists button

535
00:25:03,976 --> 00:25:07,186 A:middle
in the right-hand
side of the toolbar.

536
00:25:07,186 --> 00:25:08,166 A:middle
You'll notice two things here.

537
00:25:08,756 --> 00:25:12,116 A:middle
In the Actions Library,

538
00:25:12,416 --> 00:25:14,906 A:middle
we now have a lot more
options to choose from.

539
00:25:14,906 --> 00:25:19,076 A:middle
We have a bunch of animations
and other actions that are,

540
00:25:19,446 --> 00:25:21,666 A:middle
will change the visual
appearance

541
00:25:21,956 --> 00:25:23,256 A:middle
of things on the page.

542
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:27,776 A:middle
Now on the other side, we
have our blank page Appear

543
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,526 A:middle
Action List.

544
00:25:28,996 --> 00:25:31,866 A:middle
And when we populate this,
this is going to be the series

545
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:35,006 A:middle
of animations and actions
that get played back

546
00:25:35,596 --> 00:25:38,566 A:middle
when the user first opens
this page in their widget.

547
00:25:39,076 --> 00:25:42,766 A:middle
So in this case, because I want
to have a slide in animation,

548
00:25:43,046 --> 00:25:45,236 A:middle
I'm going to choose
the slide animation.

549
00:25:45,236 --> 00:25:49,206 A:middle
I'm going to click that plus
sign and that's going to add it

550
00:25:49,206 --> 00:25:50,716 A:middle
to my Page Appear Actions List.

551
00:25:50,786 --> 00:25:52,946 A:middle
You're also going to see
that iAd Producer is going

552
00:25:52,946 --> 00:25:55,976 A:middle
to give you a little
on-canvas preview of what

553
00:25:55,976 --> 00:25:57,146 A:middle
that animation looks like.

554
00:25:57,586 --> 00:26:02,246 A:middle
I want this to be animating in
from the top instead of the left

555
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

556
00:26:02,246 --> 00:26:03,616 A:middle
as we just saw it have.

557
00:26:04,216 --> 00:26:07,036 A:middle
So I'm going to choose
instead of in from the left

558
00:26:07,956 --> 00:26:10,406 A:middle
in that slide Inspector,
I'm going to switch it

559
00:26:10,406 --> 00:26:14,906 A:middle
over to in from the top.

560
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:17,176 A:middle
And even though we can
see that on the canvas,

561
00:26:17,406 --> 00:26:19,836 A:middle
I'm going to go one last
time into Quick Preview just

562
00:26:20,066 --> 00:26:21,946 A:middle
so that we can be dead certain

563
00:26:22,116 --> 00:26:24,506 A:middle
that this is exactly the
way we want our widget.

564
00:26:26,276 --> 00:26:27,166 A:middle
There we have it.

565
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:29,776 A:middle
It's sliding in from
the top just like we saw

566
00:26:29,776 --> 00:26:30,736 A:middle
in that original widget.

567
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:35,406 A:middle
And to recap, I have all that
great interaction that came

568
00:26:35,406 --> 00:26:39,706 A:middle
for free with that cover flow,
the swiping and the tapping.

569
00:26:40,906 --> 00:26:45,216 A:middle
And we also have those actions
hooked up to those buttons

570
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:49,166 A:middle
to make it so that we can
cycle through which image

571
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:55,936 A:middle
of the cover flow is focused one
by one, forward and backwards.

572
00:26:56,026 --> 00:26:58,626 A:middle
Now, everything I've shown you

573
00:26:58,716 --> 00:27:01,646 A:middle
up to this point
has been applicable

574
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

575
00:27:01,646 --> 00:27:05,916 A:middle
to all four project types
we support, iAd projects,

576
00:27:06,066 --> 00:27:09,406 A:middle
iTunes LPs, iTunes
Extras, and of course,

577
00:27:09,406 --> 00:27:10,526 A:middle
iBooks Author Widgets.

578
00:27:11,536 --> 00:27:14,896 A:middle
But because today, I am working
on an iBooks Author Widget,

579
00:27:15,806 --> 00:27:18,216 A:middle
I'd like to take just another
moment and show you how

580
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:20,646 A:middle
to actually get this
widget into your book.

581
00:27:21,376 --> 00:27:24,076 A:middle
So to do that, it's very easy.

582
00:27:24,246 --> 00:27:26,066 A:middle
I'm just going to
close Quick Preview.

583
00:27:26,066 --> 00:27:29,846 A:middle
I'm going to choose
File, Export to Disk.

584
00:27:30,426 --> 00:27:32,576 A:middle
You can also choose
Export to Disk Optimized

585
00:27:32,906 --> 00:27:35,016 A:middle
when you're doing your
final production export,

586
00:27:35,146 --> 00:27:37,236 A:middle
it gives you a slightly
more compressed version

587
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:38,346 A:middle
of your widget.

588
00:27:38,876 --> 00:27:41,246 A:middle
But today, I'm just going
to choose Export to Disk.

589
00:27:41,746 --> 00:27:48,396 A:middle
I'm going to call it
Animals.wdgt, and I'm going

590
00:27:49,256 --> 00:27:53,746 A:middle
to save it to my
desktop and export it.

591
00:27:57,496 --> 00:28:04,076 A:middle
At this point, I can hide iAd
Producer and I'm going to open

592
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

593
00:28:04,076 --> 00:28:07,736 A:middle
up my book in iBooks Author.

594
00:28:08,236 --> 00:28:14,296 A:middle
[ Pause ]

595
00:28:14,796 --> 00:28:16,796 A:middle
I already have a place
set out where I want

596
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:18,536 A:middle
to have this widget right here

597
00:28:18,536 --> 00:28:20,576 A:middle
in the beginning
of this section.

598
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:23,386 A:middle
So all I'm going to do is
with my exported widget

599
00:28:23,386 --> 00:28:25,836 A:middle
on my desktop, simply
going to drag and drop it

600
00:28:26,846 --> 00:28:30,006 A:middle
into iBooks Author
and just like that,

601
00:28:31,316 --> 00:28:35,376 A:middle
I have added a custom
interactive widget

602
00:28:36,546 --> 00:28:37,876 A:middle
to my iBooks Author book.

603
00:28:38,296 --> 00:28:42,586 A:middle
Under the hood, it's using
HTML and JavaScript and CSS

604
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,846 A:middle
but you didn't have
to do anything

605
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:46,876 A:middle
to get these great features.

606
00:28:46,876 --> 00:28:48,186 A:middle
You don't have to do any coding.

607
00:28:48,696 --> 00:28:51,636 A:middle
All you have to do is use
the great objects, actions

608
00:28:51,636 --> 00:28:53,346 A:middle
and animations in iAd Producer.

609
00:28:53,846 --> 00:28:59,316 A:middle
[ Applause ]

610
00:28:59,816 --> 00:29:02,116 A:middle
Thank you and with that, I'm
going to hand it back to Justin.

611
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

612
00:29:02,706 --> 00:29:03,836 A:middle
>> Thanks, Chris, that
was an awesome demo.

613
00:29:04,856 --> 00:29:07,516 A:middle
So there's two things that
Chris mentioned about that demo

614
00:29:07,776 --> 00:29:10,716 A:middle
that I want to repeat because
I think they are so cool.

615
00:29:11,076 --> 00:29:14,956 A:middle
The first thing is, is that all
the functionality you just saw

616
00:29:15,196 --> 00:29:18,136 A:middle
is all in HTML, JavaScript,
and CSS.

617
00:29:19,106 --> 00:29:21,436 A:middle
That flow view that
you saw is all HTML

618
00:29:21,566 --> 00:29:23,046 A:middle
and CSS and 3D transforms.

619
00:29:23,356 --> 00:29:24,006 A:middle
It's pretty cool.

620
00:29:24,006 --> 00:29:26,506 A:middle
I get to work on those stuff all
day and I still get blown away

621
00:29:26,506 --> 00:29:27,786 A:middle
by the stuff WebKit can do.

622
00:29:27,786 --> 00:29:29,366 A:middle
I think this is really neat.

623
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:32,076 A:middle
The other thing that
he pointed out is

624
00:29:32,076 --> 00:29:34,986 A:middle
that all the things you
just saw, all those objects,

625
00:29:35,086 --> 00:29:38,616 A:middle
those events, our animation
system, you can use all of that

626
00:29:38,616 --> 00:29:40,316 A:middle
in all four of our
project types.

627
00:29:40,786 --> 00:29:42,956 A:middle
So you can use that when
you're creating rich media ads,

628
00:29:43,386 --> 00:29:46,636 A:middle
when you're creating you're
iTunes LPs, your iTunes Extras,

629
00:29:46,936 --> 00:29:48,246 A:middle
or your iBooks Author Widgets.

630
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:52,276 A:middle
So it's some really great stuff.

631
00:29:52,476 --> 00:29:54,336 A:middle
So, now let's talk specifically

632
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:56,406 A:middle
about some things
just for iBooks.

633
00:29:57,576 --> 00:29:59,876 A:middle
While you're creating your
widget, you're going to want

634
00:29:59,876 --> 00:30:02,286 A:middle
to preview it not only in the
Quick Preview that we have

635
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

636
00:30:02,286 --> 00:30:05,366 A:middle
in iAd Producer, but you'll want
to try it out on an actual iPad.

637
00:30:05,926 --> 00:30:09,466 A:middle
And to make that really easy for
you, we've created an iPad app

638
00:30:09,466 --> 00:30:10,206 A:middle
to help you with that.

639
00:30:11,246 --> 00:30:15,146 A:middle
It's called iBooks Author Widget
Tester and with just one click,

640
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,826 A:middle
it will install right on
your iPad from iAd Producer

641
00:30:17,826 --> 00:30:19,436 A:middle
and will upload your
widget into the app

642
00:30:19,436 --> 00:30:20,696 A:middle
and you can start playing

643
00:30:20,696 --> 00:30:22,736 A:middle
around with your widget
right on your iOS device.

644
00:30:23,256 --> 00:30:26,686 A:middle
So you can run on your
actual iOS device.

645
00:30:26,686 --> 00:30:29,366 A:middle
But we also support
the iOS Simulator.

646
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:32,776 A:middle
So if you don't have an iPad
handy or you want to try it

647
00:30:32,776 --> 00:30:34,746 A:middle
out on a version of iOS
that's not installed

648
00:30:34,746 --> 00:30:38,266 A:middle
on your iPad, you
can do that too.

649
00:30:38,426 --> 00:30:40,956 A:middle
And for those of you who are
writing custom JavaScript

650
00:30:40,956 --> 00:30:42,786 A:middle
or custom CSS in your projects,

651
00:30:43,396 --> 00:30:45,056 A:middle
we also support the
Web Inspector.

652
00:30:45,486 --> 00:30:48,536 A:middle
And this works both on your
device and in a simulator

653
00:30:48,786 --> 00:30:50,546 A:middle
so that you can debug your code

654
00:30:50,546 --> 00:30:52,096 A:middle
and measure the performance
of your project.

655
00:30:52,586 --> 00:30:54,406 A:middle
If this is something that
you're interested in,

656
00:30:54,536 --> 00:30:55,866 A:middle
we actually have
an advanced session

657
00:30:55,866 --> 00:30:57,956 A:middle
about iAd Producer
later today and we'll go

658
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,086 A:middle
into this a lot more depth,

659
00:30:59,576 --> 00:31:03,256 A:middle
and we'll mention
that at the end too.

660
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

661
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:06,196 A:middle
So it's a really great new iBook
specific feature that we've got.

662
00:31:06,696 --> 00:31:09,536 A:middle
So now, I want to change
gears again and tell you

663
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:11,956 A:middle
about some iAd specific
features that we have.

664
00:31:12,486 --> 00:31:15,976 A:middle
We've got some objects
that are just for iAds.

665
00:31:16,316 --> 00:31:17,926 A:middle
One of them is this
WebGL object.

666
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:20,806 A:middle
So you can actually
take a real 3D model

667
00:31:21,126 --> 00:31:23,656 A:middle
and you can embed it right in
your ad and we've got a lot

668
00:31:23,656 --> 00:31:25,046 A:middle
of interactivity
built-in for you.

669
00:31:25,386 --> 00:31:26,576 A:middle
So you can swipe through it.

670
00:31:26,576 --> 00:31:28,356 A:middle
You can pinch and spread
to zoom in and out.

671
00:31:29,646 --> 00:31:31,806 A:middle
This is really great especially
if you've tried to do WebGL

672
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:34,646 A:middle
by scratch yourself, you
know that you kind of need

673
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:35,546 A:middle
to be an OpenGL expert.

674
00:31:35,596 --> 00:31:40,706 A:middle
You don't have to be with this.

675
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:42,276 A:middle
We also support embedded maps.

676
00:31:42,356 --> 00:31:44,086 A:middle
And these are the same
maps that you'll find

677
00:31:44,086 --> 00:31:45,516 A:middle
in the Maps app on iOS.

678
00:31:45,806 --> 00:31:47,756 A:middle
This is really great in
your ad when you want

679
00:31:47,756 --> 00:31:49,636 A:middle
to show the locations of
a business for example.

680
00:31:50,196 --> 00:31:54,816 A:middle
We also have a lot of actions
that are just for iAds.

681
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:57,686 A:middle
So these are the things
like you can prompt the user

682
00:31:57,686 --> 00:32:01,646 A:middle
to compose a tweet using the
standard Twitter compose view.

683
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

684
00:32:01,966 --> 00:32:04,196 A:middle
You can change the
wallpaper on the device.

685
00:32:04,196 --> 00:32:05,906 A:middle
You can save a ring
tone to their phone.

686
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:07,956 A:middle
There's a lot of really great
things you can do in here.

687
00:32:07,956 --> 00:32:10,026 A:middle
There's a lot and I don't
have time to mention them all.

688
00:32:10,646 --> 00:32:15,276 A:middle
But one of the really big
features that we have just

689
00:32:15,276 --> 00:32:18,006 A:middle
for iAd is this feature
called iAd Blueprints.

690
00:32:18,826 --> 00:32:22,496 A:middle
iAd Blueprints are a new
kind of iAd Producer project.

691
00:32:22,836 --> 00:32:26,886 A:middle
We've seen a lot of ads and,
you know, there are some

692
00:32:26,886 --> 00:32:29,386 A:middle
that are more successful than
others and we've tried to learn

693
00:32:29,386 --> 00:32:32,336 A:middle
about what kind of layouts
and what kind of events

694
00:32:32,336 --> 00:32:34,646 A:middle
and actions make for
a really successful ad

695
00:32:35,126 --> 00:32:36,556 A:middle
and apply those principles

696
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:38,346 A:middle
to these starter
projects we have for you.

697
00:32:39,206 --> 00:32:40,856 A:middle
There's hundreds of
project to choose from.

698
00:32:41,446 --> 00:32:43,036 A:middle
We've got a picker here
where you can narrow it

699
00:32:43,036 --> 00:32:44,326 A:middle
down by just what
you're looking for.

700
00:32:44,886 --> 00:32:48,126 A:middle
When we open it up,
it's already prebuilt.

701
00:32:48,446 --> 00:32:49,766 A:middle
So we already have
a lot of pages.

702
00:32:49,956 --> 00:32:52,706 A:middle
We've got objects on those
pages with events and actions.

703
00:32:53,246 --> 00:32:57,436 A:middle
And when you're ready to upload
your ad to the iAd network,

704
00:32:57,896 --> 00:32:59,806 A:middle
we can put you on a fast
track to certification

705
00:32:59,876 --> 00:33:00,706 A:middle
because we already know

706
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

707
00:33:00,706 --> 00:33:03,486 A:middle
that these blueprints
work really great.

708
00:33:04,576 --> 00:33:07,486 A:middle
All you have to do is fill
out a streamlined version

709
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,266 A:middle
of our Inspector interface and
bring in all of your own assets.

710
00:33:11,346 --> 00:33:12,856 A:middle
Every blueprint comes
with a spec sheet

711
00:33:13,056 --> 00:33:15,166 A:middle
that describes what kind
of assets you'll need,

712
00:33:15,446 --> 00:33:18,616 A:middle
what file names they need to
have, what sizes they need

713
00:33:18,616 --> 00:33:20,686 A:middle
to be, what formats they
need to be, and all of that.

714
00:33:21,136 --> 00:33:24,506 A:middle
And to show you just how
easy blueprints are to use,

715
00:33:24,716 --> 00:33:28,016 A:middle
I'd like to have
Chris give you a demo.

716
00:33:28,336 --> 00:33:28,556 A:middle
Chris?

717
00:33:28,556 --> 00:33:30,486 A:middle
>> Thanks again, Justin.

718
00:33:31,436 --> 00:33:33,126 A:middle
So for my last demo today,

719
00:33:33,396 --> 00:33:35,796 A:middle
I'm going to show you how
you can accelerate your ad

720
00:33:35,906 --> 00:33:38,516 A:middle
development process
with iAd Blueprints.

721
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:44,206 A:middle
So again, when you
launch iAd Producer,

722
00:33:44,896 --> 00:33:46,416 A:middle
you get our Project Picker.

723
00:33:46,986 --> 00:33:49,776 A:middle
And if you choose
iAd, that first option

724
00:33:50,306 --> 00:33:52,396 A:middle
for the project type
you're going to choose,

725
00:33:53,576 --> 00:33:56,126 A:middle
you have those four
templates to choose

726
00:33:56,126 --> 00:33:59,116 A:middle
from that are great jumping off
points if you're creating a--

727
00:33:59,116 --> 00:34:00,806 A:middle
an ad more from scratch.

728
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

729
00:34:01,696 --> 00:34:03,856 A:middle
But if you want to
use an iAd Blueprint,

730
00:34:04,646 --> 00:34:07,256 A:middle
you can open iAd Blueprints
with this toolbar button

731
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:08,626 A:middle
down on the bottom left.

732
00:34:09,016 --> 00:34:09,956 A:middle
I'm going to click that now.

733
00:34:10,496 --> 00:34:16,216 A:middle
And this is going to show you
the hundreds of iAd Blueprints

734
00:34:16,516 --> 00:34:18,966 A:middle
that we have precreated
for you to use.

735
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:23,786 A:middle
Now today, I'm going
to be making an ad

736
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:26,156 A:middle
for a fictional car
company and I happen

737
00:34:26,156 --> 00:34:29,255 A:middle
to already know what features
I want to have in that ad.

738
00:34:30,065 --> 00:34:33,966 A:middle
So I'm going to filter this list
of blueprints down to just those

739
00:34:34,196 --> 00:34:35,536 A:middle
with the features
I'm looking for.

740
00:34:36,136 --> 00:34:40,275 A:middle
I can do that simply by going
through this filter section

741
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:42,505 A:middle
and ticking off the
things I want.

742
00:34:43,545 --> 00:34:47,136 A:middle
So in my ad, I know I
want to have some maps.

743
00:34:47,136 --> 00:34:49,166 A:middle
I also want to have
a product page.

744
00:34:49,856 --> 00:34:53,545 A:middle
I know I'm going to have
multiple videos in my ad.

745
00:34:54,065 --> 00:34:56,315 A:middle
So I'm going to tick
that checkbox as well.

746
00:34:57,466 --> 00:34:59,886 A:middle
And I'm also going to have
a calendar and a form.

747
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

748
00:35:00,526 --> 00:35:03,706 A:middle
This leaves me with two
options to choose from

749
00:35:04,176 --> 00:35:06,626 A:middle
and I know I'm going to have
three videos so I'm going

750
00:35:06,626 --> 00:35:07,856 A:middle
to choose that second option.

751
00:35:08,486 --> 00:35:12,016 A:middle
Just going to click on the image
for that one, and this is going

752
00:35:12,016 --> 00:35:14,326 A:middle
to let me see a little
bit more information

753
00:35:14,326 --> 00:35:15,526 A:middle
about this blueprint.

754
00:35:15,776 --> 00:35:21,716 A:middle
I can also see screenshots,
sample pages filled

755
00:35:21,716 --> 00:35:24,756 A:middle
with placeholder content
so I can get a better feel

756
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:27,206 A:middle
for what this blueprint
is going to be like.

757
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:31,476 A:middle
It does seem to have all
the things I'm looking for.

758
00:35:32,746 --> 00:35:35,556 A:middle
So at this point, I'm going
to click on this blue button

759
00:35:36,346 --> 00:35:39,516 A:middle
up in the top right, to let
me use this iAd Blueprint.

760
00:35:40,016 --> 00:35:45,236 A:middle
[ Pause ]

761
00:35:45,736 --> 00:35:50,836 A:middle
When this loads in, you're going
to see the streamlined view

762
00:35:50,956 --> 00:35:52,996 A:middle
of iAd Producer for blueprints.

763
00:35:53,516 --> 00:35:58,266 A:middle
You're going to see that
familiar on the left-hand side,

764
00:35:58,646 --> 00:36:02,016 A:middle
Assets Library, and this is
where we have those spec sheets

765
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

766
00:36:02,016 --> 00:36:03,536 A:middle
that Justin was talking
about earlier.

767
00:36:04,216 --> 00:36:09,266 A:middle
I can look at these spec
sheets by selecting one

768
00:36:09,266 --> 00:36:12,096 A:middle
and pressing the space
bar to Quick Look it.

769
00:36:12,476 --> 00:36:17,116 A:middle
And I can also share it or
save it to the desktop just

770
00:36:17,116 --> 00:36:21,226 A:middle
by selecting them and
dragging them out.

771
00:36:21,496 --> 00:36:24,486 A:middle
You also see underneath those
spec sheets all the placeholder

772
00:36:24,486 --> 00:36:26,686 A:middle
assets that I'm going
to need to replace

773
00:36:26,926 --> 00:36:28,806 A:middle
with my own for my car company.

774
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:35,566 A:middle
In the middle, you see with
all that placeholder content,

775
00:36:35,906 --> 00:36:40,046 A:middle
all those pages already
built up, already connected

776
00:36:40,046 --> 00:36:42,986 A:middle
with actions and events under
the hood and animations.

777
00:36:43,206 --> 00:36:44,916 A:middle
They're going to make
your ad look great

778
00:36:45,766 --> 00:36:47,646 A:middle
but we still are going to have

779
00:36:47,646 --> 00:36:48,796 A:middle
to get that-- the
assets in there.

780
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,996 A:middle
We're going to get back to that.

781
00:36:51,996 --> 00:36:53,966 A:middle
And on the right-hand side,

782
00:36:54,426 --> 00:36:57,416 A:middle
our streamlined Inspector
for iAd Blueprints.

783
00:36:58,576 --> 00:37:01,056 A:middle
Here, I can put in the
specific settings for my ad,

784
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

785
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:04,126 A:middle
project title, banner
transition color,

786
00:37:05,026 --> 00:37:08,376 A:middle
and I also see the
setting for those features

787
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:10,336 A:middle
that I chose earlier
when I was picking

788
00:37:10,336 --> 00:37:12,016 A:middle
out the blueprint
that I wanted to use.

789
00:37:12,326 --> 00:37:16,296 A:middle
I have my map settings, my
form submission settings,

790
00:37:16,936 --> 00:37:19,636 A:middle
and I also have my
calendar event settings.

791
00:37:20,006 --> 00:37:21,826 A:middle
I'm going to fill this
one out real quick with--

792
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:25,556 A:middle
because I'm doing a car
company, a test drive event

793
00:37:26,216 --> 00:37:31,976 A:middle
and it's going to be
at 1 Infinite Loop.

794
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:37,186 A:middle
And, of course, I'd fill out
the Start Date and End Date

795
00:37:37,186 --> 00:37:40,326 A:middle
with the correct dates
for my test drive event.

796
00:37:41,276 --> 00:37:46,956 A:middle
But like I said, the key to
an iAd Blueprint is creating

797
00:37:47,036 --> 00:37:49,506 A:middle
that custom look and feel
with your own assets.

798
00:37:50,056 --> 00:37:52,916 A:middle
So at this point, I'm going
to use the Import button

799
00:37:53,156 --> 00:37:56,176 A:middle
in the toolbar to
bring in my own assets

800
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:58,686 A:middle
that I've already built
per the spec sheet

801
00:37:58,686 --> 00:37:59,666 A:middle
that I showed you earlier.

802
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

803
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:03,306 A:middle
Just going to navigate
to my assets.

804
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:07,866 A:middle
I'm going to select them all
and choose to import them.

805
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:11,766 A:middle
And at this point,
iAd Producer is going

806
00:38:11,766 --> 00:38:16,976 A:middle
to re-render all those snapshots
so you can see your pages

807
00:38:17,176 --> 00:38:18,496 A:middle
with your new look and feel.

808
00:38:19,026 --> 00:38:24,626 A:middle
Let's take a moment now that
I have all those custom look

809
00:38:24,626 --> 00:38:27,766 A:middle
and feel snapshots in my
project to use Quick Preview.

810
00:38:30,066 --> 00:38:32,466 A:middle
Just like in my iBooks
Author Widget from before,

811
00:38:32,466 --> 00:38:36,106 A:middle
I can have a Quick Preview
interactive of my ad.

812
00:38:36,726 --> 00:38:38,466 A:middle
And there I have, we have
the option to choose--

813
00:38:38,576 --> 00:38:41,136 A:middle
play those three
videos and I can also go

814
00:38:41,136 --> 00:38:42,616 A:middle
to the other pages in my ad.

815
00:38:43,416 --> 00:38:45,686 A:middle
Here I can see information
about my car.

816
00:38:47,096 --> 00:38:48,416 A:middle
It's looking pretty good.

817
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:50,836 A:middle
So I'm going to close
Quick Preview.

818
00:38:52,006 --> 00:38:56,196 A:middle
But before I upload this
to the iAd Test Server

819
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:59,776 A:middle
for certification, there's
one more step I need to take.

820
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

821
00:39:00,886 --> 00:39:04,426 A:middle
If you look in our Inspector,
after I added those assets,

822
00:39:04,846 --> 00:39:06,956 A:middle
I got this validation warning.

823
00:39:07,506 --> 00:39:08,996 A:middle
I'm getting one warning
right now

824
00:39:09,236 --> 00:39:11,816 A:middle
and to learn a little bit
more about it, I'm just going

825
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:15,056 A:middle
to click on the error--
the warning badge there.

826
00:39:15,546 --> 00:39:18,416 A:middle
And if I take a look
at these warnings,

827
00:39:19,326 --> 00:39:23,206 A:middle
it looks like my product.png
doesn't have quite the

828
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:24,776 A:middle
right dimensions.

829
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,906 A:middle
I'm going to have to recreate
this in the correct dimensions.

830
00:39:29,456 --> 00:39:34,336 A:middle
It just so happens I've already
done this so I'm going to import

831
00:39:34,466 --> 00:39:37,376 A:middle
that corrected asset just
by going back to Import.

832
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:40,736 A:middle
I have my corrected product.png.

833
00:39:41,336 --> 00:39:46,706 A:middle
I'm going to import it and
at this point, you're going

834
00:39:46,706 --> 00:39:51,266 A:middle
to notice that under Validation,
I have no issues found.

835
00:39:52,716 --> 00:39:54,076 A:middle
So, we're looking good.

836
00:39:54,956 --> 00:39:57,876 A:middle
The ad has that custom look and
feel that we were going for.

837
00:39:57,876 --> 00:39:59,986 A:middle
We have no validation issues.

838
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

839
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:03,236 A:middle
Let's upload it to
the iAd Test Server.

840
00:40:03,766 --> 00:40:06,896 A:middle
To do that, I'm just going
to use that third button

841
00:40:06,926 --> 00:40:09,186 A:middle
in the toolbar, the
Upload button.

842
00:40:09,736 --> 00:40:14,036 A:middle
And at this point, you'd
fill in the credentials

843
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,706 A:middle
that your account
manager gave you.

844
00:40:17,176 --> 00:40:20,666 A:middle
Your ad would be uploaded
to the iAd Test Server

845
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:22,226 A:middle
where it could be certified

846
00:40:22,226 --> 00:40:24,546 A:middle
and then eventually
reach the network.

847
00:40:25,746 --> 00:40:28,476 A:middle
And just like that, in
only a couple of steps,

848
00:40:28,946 --> 00:40:32,476 A:middle
I've created a rich, interactive
ad that's really going

849
00:40:32,476 --> 00:40:34,906 A:middle
to get my brand across and
get people to my test event.

850
00:40:35,216 --> 00:40:37,476 A:middle
And all I had to
really do was plop

851
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,746 A:middle
in a couple of custom assets.

852
00:40:40,556 --> 00:40:46,916 A:middle
Thank you and I'm going
to hand it back to Justin.

853
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:47,476 A:middle
[ Applause ]

854
00:40:47,476 --> 00:40:48,076 A:middle
>> Thanks again, Chris.

855
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:52,736 A:middle
All right, so you can see how
streamlined the process is

856
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:55,216 A:middle
for using blueprints to
create a really great ad.

857
00:40:55,846 --> 00:40:57,036 A:middle
We've done most of
the work for you.

858
00:40:57,936 --> 00:40:59,946 A:middle
We've got these great
prebuilt layouts

859
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

860
00:41:00,886 --> 00:41:03,236 A:middle
but while you're developing
your blueprint, you might find

861
00:41:03,236 --> 00:41:06,956 A:middle
that the blueprint is 99 percent
of what you want but to get

862
00:41:06,956 --> 00:41:09,726 A:middle
that last 1 percent, you really
need to reorder those buttons

863
00:41:09,726 --> 00:41:12,756 A:middle
or you need to move that label
to different spot on the page.

864
00:41:13,536 --> 00:41:16,356 A:middle
Well to do that, you can
do something called Enable

865
00:41:16,356 --> 00:41:17,326 A:middle
Unrestricted Editing.

866
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:20,126 A:middle
This is an option that you can
choose up from the Menu Bar.

867
00:41:20,126 --> 00:41:22,486 A:middle
You just go to File,
Enable Unrestricted Editing,

868
00:41:23,146 --> 00:41:25,336 A:middle
and this will convert
your blueprint project

869
00:41:25,626 --> 00:41:27,366 A:middle
into a normal iAd
Producer project

870
00:41:27,576 --> 00:41:29,556 A:middle
where you can edit all the
objects to your heart's content

871
00:41:29,556 --> 00:41:30,816 A:middle
and get exactly the
layout you want.

872
00:41:31,346 --> 00:41:33,586 A:middle
So these are really great.

873
00:41:35,456 --> 00:41:37,586 A:middle
Another feature we have for
those of you who were working

874
00:41:37,586 --> 00:41:39,856 A:middle
on ads is an app
called iAd Tester.

875
00:41:40,366 --> 00:41:43,336 A:middle
This is an iOS app that
runs in your iPhone or iPad

876
00:41:43,446 --> 00:41:46,326 A:middle
and allows you to test out
ads right on your device.

877
00:41:46,536 --> 00:41:48,806 A:middle
So with one click, you can
upload your ad to your device

878
00:41:49,116 --> 00:41:51,156 A:middle
and you can try it out
right inside of iOS.

879
00:41:52,036 --> 00:41:54,616 A:middle
This is also really great
for testing the performance

880
00:41:54,616 --> 00:41:56,786 A:middle
of your ad as it downloads
over the cellular network

881
00:41:56,786 --> 00:41:57,986 A:middle
which is an important
consideration.

882
00:41:58,536 --> 00:42:02,126 A:middle
It also runs in the
iOS Simulator so that

883
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

884
00:42:02,126 --> 00:42:04,066 A:middle
if you don't have a
device handy or if you want

885
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:07,176 A:middle
to try some other versions of
iOS, that's really easy to do.

886
00:42:08,016 --> 00:42:10,196 A:middle
And it also supports
the Web Inspector.

887
00:42:10,196 --> 00:42:12,956 A:middle
So that as you are measuring the
performance of your ad or trying

888
00:42:12,956 --> 00:42:14,926 A:middle
to debug issues with
any of your custom code,

889
00:42:15,426 --> 00:42:16,916 A:middle
you can do that easily
with the Web Inspector.

890
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,986 A:middle
And that works both on your iOS
device and in the simulator.

891
00:42:20,566 --> 00:42:25,026 A:middle
So to recap the things
we talked about today,

892
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:29,316 A:middle
iAd Producer isn't just
for creating ads anymore.

893
00:42:30,776 --> 00:42:33,216 A:middle
We've got one app that
can produce great content

894
00:42:33,256 --> 00:42:38,826 A:middle
for three platforms, rich media
ads for iAd, interactive widgets

895
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:42,916 A:middle
for iBooks Author, and
great interactive iTunes LPs

896
00:42:42,916 --> 00:42:43,456 A:middle
and Extras.

897
00:42:44,036 --> 00:42:49,076 A:middle
Our events, actions, and
animations make it really easy

898
00:42:49,076 --> 00:42:51,216 A:middle
to do custom interactivity
without needing

899
00:42:51,216 --> 00:42:53,386 A:middle
to write a single
line of custom code.

900
00:42:54,976 --> 00:42:58,196 A:middle
And our iAd Blueprints feature
makes it even easier than before

901
00:42:58,196 --> 00:42:59,406 A:middle
to create a really great ad.

902
00:42:59,966 --> 00:43:03,356 A:middle
So for more information
about iAd Producer,

903
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

904
00:43:03,766 --> 00:43:04,946 A:middle
you can email Mark Malone

905
00:43:05,526 --> 00:43:08,156 A:middle
and his job title says iAd
Technologies Evangelist,

906
00:43:08,266 --> 00:43:10,676 A:middle
but he'd be happy to take your
questions about iAd Producer

907
00:43:10,676 --> 00:43:12,136 A:middle
and any of our project types.

908
00:43:13,506 --> 00:43:15,776 A:middle
If you have not already, you
should download iAd Producer.

909
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:18,456 A:middle
It's a free download for
any registered developer

910
00:43:18,546 --> 00:43:21,246 A:middle
and the URL is here on screen
from developer.apple.com

911
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,446 A:middle
and I encourage you to
download it, create a project,

912
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:27,236 A:middle
put a button on a page, and
then preview it on a device.

913
00:43:27,616 --> 00:43:28,986 A:middle
And as you go through
that work flow,

914
00:43:28,986 --> 00:43:31,006 A:middle
I think that you'll see
just how easy it is to use

915
00:43:31,006 --> 00:43:32,516 A:middle
and how many cool things
you can do with it.

916
00:43:33,036 --> 00:43:35,786 A:middle
If you have any questions,
we have a section

917
00:43:35,786 --> 00:43:36,966 A:middle
on the Apple Developer Forums.

918
00:43:37,016 --> 00:43:40,176 A:middle
There's an iAd Producer
specific section

919
00:43:40,176 --> 00:43:42,266 A:middle
where you can ask questions
about all of our project types

920
00:43:42,606 --> 00:43:44,076 A:middle
and that URL is on
the slide here.

921
00:43:44,536 --> 00:43:48,756 A:middle
There's some other really
great sessions at WWDC

922
00:43:48,756 --> 00:43:50,136 A:middle
that you might be interested in.

923
00:43:50,286 --> 00:43:52,476 A:middle
If you want to learn more
about writing custom code

924
00:43:52,476 --> 00:43:55,216 A:middle
in your projects or to get some
really great tips and tricks

925
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:58,506 A:middle
on debugging and optimization,
later this afternoon

926
00:43:58,506 --> 00:43:59,646 A:middle
in this room, there's going

927
00:43:59,646 --> 00:44:02,026 A:middle
to be an advanced session
about iAd Producer.

928
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

929
00:44:02,026 --> 00:44:03,726 A:middle
We will show you all of that.

930
00:44:04,496 --> 00:44:07,266 A:middle
And then on the other side
of the process for iAd,

931
00:44:07,266 --> 00:44:10,346 A:middle
if you're an iOS developer and
you'd like to put iAd banners

932
00:44:10,346 --> 00:44:13,326 A:middle
into your app, there's an iAd
integration session that's going

933
00:44:13,326 --> 00:44:14,076 A:middle
to be tomorrow.

934
00:44:14,546 --> 00:44:15,656 A:middle
Thank you.

935
00:44:16,156 --> 00:44:19,793 A:middle
[Applause]
