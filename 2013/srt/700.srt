2
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:14,146 A:middle
>> Welcome to Designing
Accessories for iOS and OS X.

3
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:17,666 A:middle
So, my name is Peter Langenfeld.

4
00:00:18,256 --> 00:00:20,676 A:middle
I'll be walking you guys
through the session today,

5
00:00:20,676 --> 00:00:22,836 A:middle
and a little bit about what
are we going to talk about.

6
00:00:22,976 --> 00:00:24,906 A:middle
Of course, we're going to
talk about the new features

7
00:00:24,906 --> 00:00:27,336 A:middle
in iOS 7 and in Mavericks.

8
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:30,726 A:middle
We want to spend a
little bit of time talking

9
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:33,006 A:middle
about the frameworks
that you guys can use

10
00:00:33,006 --> 00:00:36,046 A:middle
as application developers
to utilize accessories

11
00:00:36,046 --> 00:00:38,366 A:middle
and to better expand
the accessory ecosystem.

12
00:00:38,366 --> 00:00:41,086 A:middle
And then, of course, we
want to focus in on some

13
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:43,796 A:middle
of the technologies and new
things we've done overall

14
00:00:43,796 --> 00:00:44,696 A:middle
and the exciting--

15
00:00:44,816 --> 00:00:46,306 A:middle
these exciting parts that
we think you guys have

16
00:00:46,306 --> 00:00:50,726 A:middle
opportunities in regarding
Wi-Fi, AirPlay, Bluetooth,

17
00:00:50,726 --> 00:00:52,076 A:middle
Lightning connector,
few other things

18
00:00:52,076 --> 00:00:53,876 A:middle
that we'll probably
touch on in between.

19
00:00:54,526 --> 00:00:57,146 A:middle
So, first, I want
to thank you guys,

20
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:00,806 A:middle
thank you for coming today,
thank you giving me a nice crowd

21
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

22
00:01:00,806 --> 00:01:02,296 A:middle
to get nervous in front of.

23
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:03,706 A:middle
But also thank you
for developing

24
00:01:03,846 --> 00:01:05,976 A:middle
such great devices
and accessories.

25
00:01:06,256 --> 00:01:08,416 A:middle
It really makes us excited
everyday to come in to work

26
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:10,626 A:middle
and to work on the overall
accessory ecosystem,

27
00:01:11,046 --> 00:01:13,076 A:middle
see how many cool
things appearing

28
00:01:13,296 --> 00:01:15,326 A:middle
for our users to enjoy.

29
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:20,876 A:middle
You know, one of the big
things that we notice working

30
00:01:20,876 --> 00:01:22,806 A:middle
on accessories in the
accessory ecosystem is

31
00:01:22,806 --> 00:01:27,996 A:middle
that you guys have really
helped our devices become a part

32
00:01:27,996 --> 00:01:30,446 A:middle
of people's everyday lives,
a critical part of that.

33
00:01:30,926 --> 00:01:32,466 A:middle
And so I want to give
you guys a few examples

34
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:34,716 A:middle
of the things we find
really interesting and kind

35
00:01:34,716 --> 00:01:36,936 A:middle
of maybe give you some ideas

36
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:38,986 A:middle
of areas you can work
on and expand on.

37
00:01:39,256 --> 00:01:41,276 A:middle
Of course, we always like
to see new things as well.

38
00:01:41,646 --> 00:01:43,816 A:middle
So health and fitness
is great area

39
00:01:43,816 --> 00:01:45,686 A:middle
that we've been seeing a
lot of expansion recently.

40
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:49,226 A:middle
You know, in this
particular example,

41
00:01:49,226 --> 00:01:50,726 A:middle
we have a blood pressure cuff,

42
00:01:50,726 --> 00:01:54,796 A:middle
but we also have fitness
monitors, Wi-Fi scales,

43
00:01:54,796 --> 00:01:57,206 A:middle
things that basically
help people to keep track

44
00:01:57,206 --> 00:02:00,766 A:middle
of their everyday lives to
become better individuals

45
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

46
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:04,466 A:middle
and to really make the
merging of the applications,

47
00:02:04,716 --> 00:02:09,246 A:middle
the iOS device, the Mac device,
and the accessory system meshed

48
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:11,326 A:middle
into their everyday lives
and improve life in general.

49
00:02:11,586 --> 00:02:12,396 A:middle
And we think that's great.

50
00:02:12,796 --> 00:02:13,756 A:middle
We love seeing it.

51
00:02:14,196 --> 00:02:16,506 A:middle
Of course, we also have
some home products as well.

52
00:02:16,806 --> 00:02:21,056 A:middle
Here's the Nest thermostat
and it really, again,

53
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,856 A:middle
just highlights the fact
that you can merge this

54
00:02:23,856 --> 00:02:27,186 A:middle
into your life, you can
utilize it, you can decide

55
00:02:27,186 --> 00:02:29,996 A:middle
to save some energy, you can
decide to heat up your home,

56
00:02:30,286 --> 00:02:32,616 A:middle
you can decide to see
how you're doing as far

57
00:02:32,616 --> 00:02:37,236 A:middle
as performance overall so that
you can add something more

58
00:02:37,236 --> 00:02:39,066 A:middle
to your overall experience
than just "Oh,

59
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:40,246 A:middle
I feel cold," or "I feel hot."

60
00:02:40,606 --> 00:02:41,976 A:middle
You can actually see
how things are going

61
00:02:41,976 --> 00:02:42,876 A:middle
and we think that's great.

62
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:44,546 A:middle
And then finally, fun.

63
00:02:45,156 --> 00:02:46,816 A:middle
Everybody likes to have fun.

64
00:02:47,076 --> 00:02:48,006 A:middle
We like to have fun.

65
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:51,236 A:middle
And we think it's fun that you
guys have enabled things like--

66
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:53,936 A:middle
they are drawn to play
kind of the interactive,

67
00:02:54,376 --> 00:02:57,226 A:middle
virtual reality video
games essentially.

68
00:02:57,646 --> 00:03:00,476 A:middle
And all of that is
enabled by accessories.

69
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

70
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,016 A:middle
All of that is enabled
by you guys.

71
00:03:02,256 --> 00:03:04,726 A:middle
And it makes us excited
and thrilled to come

72
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,666 A:middle
to work every day,
create solutions together

73
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,626 A:middle
that we can really get
the overall consumer base

74
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:11,236 A:middle
excited about.

75
00:03:11,656 --> 00:03:12,836 A:middle
So how do we do that?

76
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:15,336 A:middle
Well, here's the
infamous super slide.

77
00:03:15,336 --> 00:03:19,266 A:middle
These are all the different
technologies that we support.

78
00:03:19,356 --> 00:03:20,436 A:middle
There's obviously many more

79
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:22,726 A:middle
but we think these ones
are particularly important.

80
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:24,656 A:middle
And this here, I
think, we really want

81
00:03:24,656 --> 00:03:30,946 A:middle
to highlight the fact that OS
X and OS 7-- iOS 7, excuse me,

82
00:03:31,316 --> 00:03:33,976 A:middle
work together and
as app developers

83
00:03:33,976 --> 00:03:37,446 A:middle
and accessory manufacturers, you
guys can support both platforms,

84
00:03:38,026 --> 00:03:42,666 A:middle
mostly seamlessly and really
support more consumers overall.

85
00:03:44,116 --> 00:03:47,016 A:middle
So we have a few actual
connectivity options listed

86
00:03:47,016 --> 00:03:47,576 A:middle
on the slide.

87
00:03:47,576 --> 00:03:51,806 A:middle
Of course, Wi-Fi, Lightning,
Bluetooth low energy are things

88
00:03:51,996 --> 00:03:53,506 A:middle
that we're very excited about

89
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:55,656 A:middle
and are pushing forward
constantly as far

90
00:03:55,656 --> 00:03:57,626 A:middle
as the technology bases.

91
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,776 A:middle
But also things such as
the 3.5-millimeter jack,

92
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

93
00:04:00,776 --> 00:04:03,706 A:middle
the headphone jack are
also opportunities for you

94
00:04:03,796 --> 00:04:07,036 A:middle
as developers to take
advantage of in both your apps

95
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:08,806 A:middle
and in the overall
accessory ecosystem.

96
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:11,046 A:middle
So we want to highlight
those things.

97
00:04:11,766 --> 00:04:16,255 A:middle
Of course, there are also the
way you access these things

98
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:20,106 A:middle
from apps, the actual protocols
and the frameworks, like I said,

99
00:04:20,106 --> 00:04:24,076 A:middle
that are available, again,
across both OS platforms.

100
00:04:24,356 --> 00:04:25,936 A:middle
And so let's dive in
to a couple of these.

101
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:28,836 A:middle
Let's talk a little bit about
what you can do with them

102
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,716 A:middle
and we won't be able to
hit them all but hopefully,

103
00:04:30,716 --> 00:04:32,716 A:middle
we can give you some
ideas of places

104
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:34,366 A:middle
where you could start developing

105
00:04:34,366 --> 00:04:35,956 A:middle
and getting some
exciting products going.

106
00:04:37,156 --> 00:04:39,876 A:middle
First up, USB Audio.

107
00:04:40,116 --> 00:04:43,086 A:middle
You access USB Audio
as an app developer

108
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:46,346 A:middle
through the Core Audio
Framework that's both

109
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:49,276 A:middle
on iOS and OS X again.

110
00:04:49,276 --> 00:04:52,476 A:middle
And, you know, you
can design products

111
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:56,406 A:middle
that are USB 1 compliant
and we will support them.

112
00:04:56,756 --> 00:04:59,816 A:middle
We'd really recommend you guys
start thinking about USB 2.0

113
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:02,906 A:middle
as a standard and that's on the
accessory manufacturing side.

114
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

115
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:06,266 A:middle
And that's for both
input and output devices.

116
00:05:06,546 --> 00:05:10,236 A:middle
You know, although you
can support a number

117
00:05:10,236 --> 00:05:14,356 A:middle
of sampling rights on both the
physical device side and the OS,

118
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:17,326 A:middle
the application side, we want
to stress that, you know,

119
00:05:17,646 --> 00:05:20,616 A:middle
16-bit when you're
PCM, 32, 4401,

120
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:23,466 A:middle
48 kilohertz is really the
standard that we focus in on.

121
00:05:23,716 --> 00:05:25,316 A:middle
And so we do make
it a requirement

122
00:05:25,316 --> 00:05:28,956 A:middle
of all external accessories to
support those sampling rights

123
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:31,816 A:middle
and we would suggest as
application manufacturers,

124
00:05:32,036 --> 00:05:34,776 A:middle
application developers,
you also focus

125
00:05:34,776 --> 00:05:37,126 A:middle
in on supporting those rights
and make sure not to block them

126
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:38,196 A:middle
from requirement standpoint.

127
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:41,046 A:middle
You do have access
to multichannel audio

128
00:05:41,226 --> 00:05:43,346 A:middle
on both sides should
you choose to use it.

129
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,386 A:middle
And then finally, of course,
volume synchronization.

130
00:05:47,496 --> 00:05:50,536 A:middle
If you adjust the volume on the
OS side or you adjust the volume

131
00:05:50,536 --> 00:05:52,646 A:middle
on the accessory side, the
two should be synchronized.

132
00:05:53,026 --> 00:05:55,246 A:middle
You should get volume
increases and decreases

133
00:05:55,496 --> 00:05:57,586 A:middle
as the consumer really sees fit

134
00:05:57,586 --> 00:06:00,046 A:middle
and that's all available
to you as well.

135
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

136
00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:02,376 A:middle
So next up, something new.

137
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:04,716 A:middle
We talked about this
a little bit yesterday

138
00:06:04,716 --> 00:06:06,236 A:middle
and we'll be talking about
it more throughout the week,

139
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:07,556 A:middle
is game controller.

140
00:06:08,196 --> 00:06:09,276 A:middle
This, we think, is great.

141
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:10,766 A:middle
This is something we're
really excited about.

142
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:15,186 A:middle
We've decided to standardize
around the concept that iOS

143
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:19,396 A:middle
and Mavericks should have a
consistent game controller

144
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:21,126 A:middle
experience that you
can use in both places,

145
00:06:21,436 --> 00:06:23,356 A:middle
and that application
developers can utilize

146
00:06:23,356 --> 00:06:25,966 A:middle
to create richer,
more immersive games.

147
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:29,666 A:middle
As you can see, we have a
standard game controller

148
00:06:30,076 --> 00:06:31,966 A:middle
and of course, we
also expand that out

149
00:06:31,966 --> 00:06:33,436 A:middle
to an extended game controller.

150
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,056 A:middle
Really, the extended game
controller adds a secondary

151
00:06:37,056 --> 00:06:40,556 A:middle
trigger button or shoulder
button and some joysticks.

152
00:06:40,996 --> 00:06:44,876 A:middle
And we do have a session
later today actually

153
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:47,606 A:middle
to talk a little bit more
detail about the hardware

154
00:06:47,896 --> 00:06:49,536 A:middle
and the software
requirements of that.

155
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,726 A:middle
Also, reference it a little
bit later in this presentation.

156
00:06:52,156 --> 00:06:54,496 A:middle
But please, if you're
interested in game controller,

157
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:56,886 A:middle
come to the labs, go to the
sessions, and really get

158
00:06:56,886 --> 00:06:58,846 A:middle
to know more about this 'cause
this is something we think is

159
00:06:59,196 --> 00:07:02,946 A:middle
really to make the game space
a great, a better experience

160
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

161
00:07:02,946 --> 00:07:06,376 A:middle
than it even is today,
and that's hard to create.

162
00:07:06,536 --> 00:07:09,156 A:middle
Okay. So iPod accessory
protocol.

163
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:11,706 A:middle
We now refer to this
as iAP usually,

164
00:07:11,706 --> 00:07:13,736 A:middle
and you'll hear us
all slip in to that,

165
00:07:13,736 --> 00:07:16,546 A:middle
so that's what we're referring
to if we talk about it.

166
00:07:16,546 --> 00:07:20,776 A:middle
And the key here is it's
basically how you access a bunch

167
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:23,056 A:middle
of the system services on iOS.

168
00:07:23,536 --> 00:07:28,156 A:middle
It's been around since we
introduced the 30-pin dock many

169
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,726 A:middle
years ago, we've kept it around.

170
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,176 A:middle
We continued to expand it.

171
00:07:31,176 --> 00:07:33,596 A:middle
We continued to think it's
a great way to interface

172
00:07:33,596 --> 00:07:36,906 A:middle
with accessories in
an Apple-specific way.

173
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:40,596 A:middle
We've given you access
to the media library,

174
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:42,756 A:middle
and what that means is you
can look at all the metadata

175
00:07:42,756 --> 00:07:46,316 A:middle
on the device, organize as
we organize it, and you can--

176
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:49,476 A:middle
on your accessory side, you
can decide to display it

177
00:07:49,476 --> 00:07:52,016 A:middle
to your user in a way that
you think makes the most sense

178
00:07:52,016 --> 00:07:54,346 A:middle
to them and allow them to browse

179
00:07:54,456 --> 00:07:56,026 A:middle
and use playback
controls, et cetera.

180
00:07:56,336 --> 00:07:58,686 A:middle
Next up, of course,
is the accessory--

181
00:07:58,736 --> 00:08:02,426 A:middle
external accessory protocol,
EA as we like to call it.

182
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

183
00:08:02,426 --> 00:08:04,726 A:middle
It's the best way to have
an application talk directly

184
00:08:04,726 --> 00:08:08,506 A:middle
with your physical accessory
that you decide to design.

185
00:08:08,876 --> 00:08:10,066 A:middle
And the exciting
part there, I think,

186
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:13,476 A:middle
is that we also have app
discovery and app launch.

187
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:16,186 A:middle
So, if someone goes out
to the store and decides

188
00:08:16,186 --> 00:08:19,126 A:middle
to buy an accessory for the
first time, they plug it

189
00:08:19,126 --> 00:08:21,156 A:middle
in to their device or they
connect it to their device.

190
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:23,046 A:middle
The first thing that
the device does

191
00:08:23,046 --> 00:08:25,366 A:middle
from a system aspect is
ask you, "Do you want

192
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:26,726 A:middle
to download the app
for this device?"

193
00:08:27,186 --> 00:08:28,096 A:middle
It's a great feature.

194
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:30,226 A:middle
It prevents people from
having to search on the store.

195
00:08:30,446 --> 00:08:31,646 A:middle
It prevents people
from having to look

196
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:32,956 A:middle
through the manual, et cetera.

197
00:08:33,356 --> 00:08:35,275 A:middle
And we think people
really enjoy it

198
00:08:35,626 --> 00:08:38,836 A:middle
and we love the way it's working
out and we hope you guys decide

199
00:08:38,836 --> 00:08:40,645 A:middle
to try and exercise
that a little bit too.

200
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:43,456 A:middle
The next, location information.

201
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:46,076 A:middle
You can decide to expand
the location capabilities

202
00:08:46,076 --> 00:08:46,566 A:middle
of your device.

203
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:48,046 A:middle
Finally, accessibility.

204
00:08:48,216 --> 00:08:51,706 A:middle
Obviously, some people, some
of our customers need some help

205
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:55,326 A:middle
in using our devices and we've
made these frameworks available

206
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,486 A:middle
to you to make sure you
can design accessories

207
00:08:57,486 --> 00:09:00,306 A:middle
that help them use that
and help everyone enjoy

208
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

209
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,626 A:middle
and utilize their iOS
device to its fullest.

210
00:09:06,376 --> 00:09:09,546 A:middle
Many of the technologies
I've been talking about fall

211
00:09:09,546 --> 00:09:11,036 A:middle
under the MFi Licensing Program.

212
00:09:11,486 --> 00:09:14,986 A:middle
MFi is made for iPod,
iPhone and iPod.

213
00:09:15,636 --> 00:09:16,496 A:middle
And what does it include?

214
00:09:16,906 --> 00:09:22,226 A:middle
Well, it's a program that gives
you access to our connectors,

215
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:23,436 A:middle
to receive a Lightning
connector.

216
00:09:24,516 --> 00:09:28,786 A:middle
[ Pause ]

217
00:09:29,286 --> 00:09:32,026 A:middle
Our headphone with remote
system which is a great way

218
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:36,406 A:middle
to not only listen to the music
and audio from your devices,

219
00:09:36,806 --> 00:09:40,366 A:middle
both on the MAC side
and on the iOS side,

220
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:43,506 A:middle
but also allows you
to use the controls.

221
00:09:43,506 --> 00:09:46,366 A:middle
Again, volume controls,
play/pause, all of the things

222
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:48,686 A:middle
that people are used to
using on a day-to-day basis.

223
00:09:48,846 --> 00:09:51,976 A:middle
Finally, AirPlay
licensing, we now allow you

224
00:09:51,976 --> 00:09:55,756 A:middle
to create AirPlay accessories
and finally, AirPrint.

225
00:09:56,786 --> 00:09:58,856 A:middle
And really, the intent
here is to make sure

226
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:01,366 A:middle
that there's a sense of
quality for the consumer

227
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

228
00:10:01,366 --> 00:10:01,976 A:middle
when they go into a store.

229
00:10:02,046 --> 00:10:05,876 A:middle
We keep the MFi Program
around and we allow the badge

230
00:10:05,876 --> 00:10:08,496 A:middle
to be used on products
that Apple

231
00:10:08,496 --> 00:10:10,446 A:middle
and the accessory
manufacturers have worked hard

232
00:10:10,446 --> 00:10:14,456 A:middle
to guarantee our solid quality
experiences for the consumer.

233
00:10:14,786 --> 00:10:16,866 A:middle
So, when you go shopping
for an accessory,

234
00:10:17,186 --> 00:10:19,786 A:middle
you know with confidence
that if I buy this accessory

235
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,126 A:middle
and take it home, it'll
work with my device today,

236
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,286 A:middle
and it'll also work with
my devices in the future.

237
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,716 A:middle
If you want to join
the MFi Program,

238
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,466 A:middle
we obviously have many
people you can talk

239
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:31,596 A:middle
to in the lab sessions today.

240
00:10:32,886 --> 00:10:34,636 A:middle
We highly encourage
you to chat with us,

241
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:37,016 A:middle
understand with it's about,
understand what you get.

242
00:10:37,556 --> 00:10:39,996 A:middle
Some of the highlights, you
get full technical information

243
00:10:40,656 --> 00:10:43,006 A:middle
of how to interface
with our devices.

244
00:10:43,346 --> 00:10:45,896 A:middle
You get access to all the
components, so connectors,

245
00:10:46,556 --> 00:10:48,866 A:middle
headphone, mic-- and
mic systems, et cetera.

246
00:10:49,286 --> 00:10:51,616 A:middle
All tools that we
make available as far

247
00:10:51,616 --> 00:10:54,816 A:middle
as developing accessories,
this will help you understand

248
00:10:55,336 --> 00:10:58,046 A:middle
if you're speaking the protocols
properly, if you're electrically

249
00:10:58,086 --> 00:10:59,986 A:middle
in sync with our specifications.

250
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

251
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:03,426 A:middle
And finally, it gives you access
to the product certification

252
00:11:03,806 --> 00:11:06,306 A:middle
and the logos and
compatibility icons

253
00:11:06,576 --> 00:11:08,116 A:middle
if you pass product
certification.

254
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:14,516 A:middle
So that's what I'm going to
do from a high-level overview.

255
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:16,306 A:middle
Obviously, it's a complex phase.

256
00:11:16,786 --> 00:11:19,046 A:middle
Like I said, we definitely
have many lab sessions

257
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:21,626 A:middle
that we are more than
happy and willing to talk

258
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:22,546 A:middle
to you guys about this.

259
00:11:22,876 --> 00:11:24,436 A:middle
And, you know, I'm just
trying to highlight here

260
00:11:24,436 --> 00:11:27,176 A:middle
that no matter what
transport you decide to use,

261
00:11:27,696 --> 00:11:29,426 A:middle
you pretty much have an
option to do some sort

262
00:11:29,426 --> 00:11:31,966 A:middle
of communication, whether here
it's audio or communication

263
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:35,906 A:middle
with apps, there's also a
number of other options we have.

264
00:11:35,906 --> 00:11:38,056 A:middle
So, hopefully, you guys
are getting inspired,

265
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:39,286 A:middle
hopefully you guys
are getting excited

266
00:11:39,286 --> 00:11:41,306 A:middle
to make some accessories,
to make some apps that work

267
00:11:41,306 --> 00:11:45,106 A:middle
with accessories, and we would
really enjoy talking to you.

268
00:11:45,196 --> 00:11:47,806 A:middle
So, please come along
and ask some questions.

269
00:11:48,036 --> 00:11:53,846 A:middle
Let's switch gears just a little
bit and let's talk about some

270
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,706 A:middle
of the advances we have in
specific technology areas.

271
00:11:56,996 --> 00:12:00,876 A:middle
First up, I'd like to
highlight wireless.

272
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

273
00:12:01,356 --> 00:12:03,146 A:middle
We at Apple think wireless
is a great solution,

274
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:05,846 A:middle
and wireless includes
both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth,

275
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:09,096 A:middle
and Bluetooth low
energy of course.

276
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:13,816 A:middle
And why we like wireless so
much is that the consumer gets

277
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,886 A:middle
to keep the device in their
pocket or in their hand,

278
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:17,956 A:middle
and they don't have to worry
about walking over to it

279
00:12:17,956 --> 00:12:19,416 A:middle
and plugging in it or having a--

280
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:21,246 A:middle
forgetting it somewhere
and leaving it.

281
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:23,456 A:middle
They can just walk into the
room where these things exist

282
00:12:23,456 --> 00:12:25,536 A:middle
and they can start
using it seamlessly,

283
00:12:25,856 --> 00:12:26,566 A:middle
which we think is great.

284
00:12:27,086 --> 00:12:30,866 A:middle
On the Wi-Fi front, couple

285
00:12:30,866 --> 00:12:32,346 A:middle
of things we think you guys
should be thinking about.

286
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:37,226 A:middle
On the software side, definitely
realize that networking sockets

287
00:12:37,226 --> 00:12:39,046 A:middle
and ports are your friends.

288
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:41,266 A:middle
We have great frameworks
for dealing with both.

289
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:42,506 A:middle
They're totally open.

290
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,896 A:middle
You can determine how
you want to speak to

291
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:47,226 A:middle
and communicate with
your accessory.

292
00:12:47,996 --> 00:12:50,996 A:middle
And I also highlight that we
have Bonjour, and I'll talk

293
00:12:50,996 --> 00:12:52,196 A:middle
in some more detail in a minute

294
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:55,786 A:middle
but Bonjour is really the best
way we think for consumers

295
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:59,106 A:middle
to be able to interact with
network devices without having

296
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:00,516 A:middle
to know the technical
details of them.

297
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

298
00:13:01,086 --> 00:13:03,376 A:middle
On the hardware front, a couple
of things I want to stress,

299
00:13:03,376 --> 00:13:06,036 A:middle
and I've talked about this
in the past but hopefully,

300
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,666 A:middle
we can all get on
board with this now.

301
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,806 A:middle
The Wi-Fi Alliance Certification
is really important

302
00:13:10,806 --> 00:13:11,736 A:middle
in the Wi-Fi space.

303
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,686 A:middle
It makes sure and ensures
that you have inoperability,

304
00:13:15,986 --> 00:13:19,226 A:middle
it makes sure that when your
customer brings the device,

305
00:13:19,226 --> 00:13:21,286 A:middle
it's not going to interfere
with other Wi-Fi devices

306
00:13:21,286 --> 00:13:23,176 A:middle
in their home, and it's
also going to work well

307
00:13:23,176 --> 00:13:26,046 A:middle
with any brand of
router and any brand

308
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:27,766 A:middle
of infrastructures
that they may have.

309
00:13:29,196 --> 00:13:31,466 A:middle
Dual band operation I think
is also something that we

310
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:33,006 A:middle
like to stress and
I realize it's--

311
00:13:33,506 --> 00:13:35,556 A:middle
it may seem unnecessary
on the accessory front.

312
00:13:35,966 --> 00:13:40,546 A:middle
But we all have more and more
RF interference in our homes.

313
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:43,996 A:middle
And obviously, everything is
using the 2.4 gigahertz space.

314
00:13:43,996 --> 00:13:45,246 A:middle
We have Wi-Fi, we
have Bluetooth,

315
00:13:45,246 --> 00:13:47,696 A:middle
we have all these technologies,
ISM unlicensed band.

316
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:49,176 A:middle
And so we really
want to encourage you

317
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:53,776 A:middle
to give the consumer the option
to put both 2.4 and 5 gigahertz

318
00:13:54,246 --> 00:13:57,016 A:middle
into the device so they can use
whatever gives them the best

319
00:13:57,016 --> 00:14:00,196 A:middle
experience, so, to
avoid audio dropouts

320
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

321
00:14:00,436 --> 00:14:04,416 A:middle
and communication breakdowns
and the fact that if you walk

322
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,706 A:middle
to one corner of your home

323
00:14:05,706 --> 00:14:08,006 A:middle
and your neighbor has
a strong Wi-Fi signal,

324
00:14:08,006 --> 00:14:10,246 A:middle
you may get more
error rate, et cetera.

325
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:13,496 A:middle
If you enable the products
with dual band performance,

326
00:14:13,776 --> 00:14:16,306 A:middle
hopefully, we can avoid that
and we can get to a better place

327
00:14:16,306 --> 00:14:20,746 A:middle
as far as wireless usability and
enjoinment from our consumers.

328
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:24,306 A:middle
The final two things are
really on the software front

329
00:14:24,306 --> 00:14:27,316 A:middle
but they're specifically
targeted towards hardware OEMs.

330
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:30,006 A:middle
And so, I want to stress
quality of service, WMM,

331
00:14:30,006 --> 00:14:32,916 A:middle
this is an inherent
part of 802.11n.

332
00:14:33,296 --> 00:14:34,426 A:middle
You have to certify for it.

333
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:37,216 A:middle
What I really make sure
is that high bandwidth

334
00:14:37,216 --> 00:14:39,186 A:middle
and high priority traffic

335
00:14:39,186 --> 00:14:42,046 A:middle
on the network actually gets
the priority it deserves.

336
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:45,426 A:middle
So, it makes sure that you
avoid network dropouts again,

337
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:47,566 A:middle
it'll make sure you,
you know, avoid glitches

338
00:14:47,566 --> 00:14:49,706 A:middle
in your video stream, which
is in your audio stream,

339
00:14:50,046 --> 00:14:50,956 A:middle
those sorts of things.

340
00:14:51,396 --> 00:14:53,286 A:middle
And finally, IPv6 versus IPv4.

341
00:14:53,356 --> 00:14:57,556 A:middle
Now that we're entering the
age of the internet of things,

342
00:14:57,896 --> 00:14:59,986 A:middle
the fact that everything is
connected, we're quickly going

343
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:01,426 A:middle
to start running out addresses.

344
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

345
00:15:01,816 --> 00:15:05,376 A:middle
And so we at Apple, believe
strongly we should all be making

346
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:08,336 A:middle
the transition over to IPv6
and we encourage you guys

347
00:15:08,336 --> 00:15:10,106 A:middle
to make sure that you have
the ability to do the same.

348
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:12,126 A:middle
A little bit more on Bonjour.

349
00:15:13,306 --> 00:15:15,176 A:middle
So, as I mentioned before,

350
00:15:15,536 --> 00:15:19,586 A:middle
Bonjour is a zero-configuration
networking protocol suite.

351
00:15:20,236 --> 00:15:21,396 A:middle
Really, what it boils down to

352
00:15:21,536 --> 00:15:25,106 A:middle
from the consumer's perspective
is that use a friendly name.

353
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:31,346 A:middle
So, you don't have
192.168.0.1 or 10.0.0.1

354
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,326 A:middle
or something identifying
your product.

355
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:37,436 A:middle
You name it WAMP or computer
or microphone or something

356
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,496 A:middle
that means what it
does to the consumer

357
00:15:40,496 --> 00:15:42,746 A:middle
and the consumer has the
ability to rename that device

358
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:44,786 A:middle
and to have the experience
to find that device

359
00:15:44,786 --> 00:15:47,336 A:middle
on their network just by using
the name that they can remember.

360
00:15:48,036 --> 00:15:48,776 A:middle
We think that's great.

361
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:53,086 A:middle
No worry about IP addresses,
no worry about URLs, hopefully,

362
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,276 A:middle
no worry about having to go
to the user manual to find

363
00:15:55,276 --> 00:15:57,466 A:middle
out where to find out
where they should be going

364
00:15:57,466 --> 00:15:58,336 A:middle
to configure things.

365
00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:00,966 A:middle
It should just be easy for
them to bring something home,

366
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

367
00:16:00,966 --> 00:16:03,046 A:middle
put it on their network
and enjoy it

368
00:16:03,316 --> 00:16:04,376 A:middle
with the name they recognize.

369
00:16:06,426 --> 00:16:09,106 A:middle
Next up is network
service discovery.

370
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,856 A:middle
What this does is
it allows the--

371
00:16:11,996 --> 00:16:14,376 A:middle
well, allows applications
to filter

372
00:16:14,376 --> 00:16:18,756 A:middle
down what devices the consumer
sees by the actual function

373
00:16:18,756 --> 00:16:19,576 A:middle
that they want to provide.

374
00:16:20,286 --> 00:16:24,016 A:middle
So, for example for AirPlay,
we use Bonjour to make sure

375
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,586 A:middle
to only display those devices

376
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:28,946 A:middle
that support AirPlay audio
coming to them instead

377
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,716 A:middle
of showing all the
devices on your network

378
00:16:30,796 --> 00:16:32,756 A:middle
that might perhaps
support something

379
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:33,506 A:middle
that you're interested in.

380
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:36,636 A:middle
By doing this, you give to
your consumer a much targeted,

381
00:16:36,816 --> 00:16:39,486 A:middle
a much more enjoyable experience
'cause they only see the things

382
00:16:39,486 --> 00:16:40,996 A:middle
that they need, they
only see the things

383
00:16:40,996 --> 00:16:43,486 A:middle
that they can use
right now for the type

384
00:16:43,486 --> 00:16:45,016 A:middle
of things that they want to do.

385
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:47,176 A:middle
We believe so strongly in this.

386
00:16:47,596 --> 00:16:49,196 A:middle
We've actually made
this open source.

387
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:52,426 A:middle
It's part of the
mDNSResponder project.

388
00:16:53,016 --> 00:16:55,086 A:middle
You can find it at the
address listed there.

389
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,626 A:middle
We highly encourage you
to go and take a look

390
00:16:57,626 --> 00:16:59,276 A:middle
and if you have any
more questions

391
00:16:59,276 --> 00:17:02,476 A:middle
about general functionality,
obviously you can talk to us

392
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

393
00:17:02,476 --> 00:17:04,685 A:middle
in the accessory labs or I'm
sure you can find someone

394
00:17:04,685 --> 00:17:06,766 A:middle
in networking labs that can
help talk you through this

395
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:10,425 A:middle
and give all of our consumers
a better or raw experience.

396
00:17:11,205 --> 00:17:12,656 A:middle
Configuring wi-fi accessories.

397
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:15,306 A:middle
You know, I talked about this
need to make sure we get way

398
00:17:15,306 --> 00:17:20,076 A:middle
from forcing people to go to the
user manual and forcing people

399
00:17:20,076 --> 00:17:24,415 A:middle
to come home with their device,
set it up, get ready to use it,

400
00:17:24,856 --> 00:17:26,925 A:middle
only to realize, "Oh
wait, how do I get this

401
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:28,076 A:middle
on my Wi-Fi infrastructure?"

402
00:17:28,406 --> 00:17:31,016 A:middle
But we took care of
this a couple years back

403
00:17:31,406 --> 00:17:33,106 A:middle
and we enabled Wi-Fi
information sharing.

404
00:17:33,746 --> 00:17:35,956 A:middle
What it does is you plug the
accessory into a physical port

405
00:17:36,146 --> 00:17:38,926 A:middle
or Bluetooth and then it
asks you, "Do you want

406
00:17:38,926 --> 00:17:40,546 A:middle
to share your networking
credentials

407
00:17:40,546 --> 00:17:44,296 A:middle
to your iOS device that's
already on with your accessory?"

408
00:17:44,816 --> 00:17:45,576 A:middle
Great, perfect.

409
00:17:45,576 --> 00:17:46,096 A:middle
They can say yes.

410
00:17:46,186 --> 00:17:46,836 A:middle
They can say no.

411
00:17:47,376 --> 00:17:49,066 A:middle
Great, it's all configured,
you don't have worry about it.

412
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:49,786 A:middle
No manual needed.

413
00:17:51,386 --> 00:17:55,246 A:middle
However, we did hear from a
few people, wouldn't it be nice

414
00:17:55,246 --> 00:17:56,626 A:middle
if we didn't have to
include a physical port?

415
00:17:56,626 --> 00:17:58,716 A:middle
Wouldn't it be nice if you
can do this Wi-Fi-only?

416
00:17:58,756 --> 00:18:01,656 A:middle
Well, we agreed and now you can.

417
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

418
00:18:02,636 --> 00:18:05,746 A:middle
So, what I'm showing you
here is a Wi-Fi-only way

419
00:18:05,746 --> 00:18:07,036 A:middle
to configure your accessories.

420
00:18:07,846 --> 00:18:09,926 A:middle
Essentially, what happens on
the accessory front is it goes

421
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:12,546 A:middle
into a software AP mode,
software access point mode.

422
00:18:13,016 --> 00:18:15,556 A:middle
And we identify it as
non-configured device.

423
00:18:15,946 --> 00:18:17,916 A:middle
So, up there on the screen,
you can see set up new device.

424
00:18:18,676 --> 00:18:20,576 A:middle
This is a very similar
system that we've had

425
00:18:20,576 --> 00:18:21,976 A:middle
for our AirPort products
for a while.

426
00:18:22,306 --> 00:18:23,366 A:middle
We've just added third parties.

427
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:24,706 A:middle
So, you see Thermostat there.

428
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:29,136 A:middle
So, if I select Thermostat,
I now get the option

429
00:18:29,136 --> 00:18:32,486 A:middle
to join the network to my
iOS device that's already on.

430
00:18:33,456 --> 00:18:35,196 A:middle
I can obviously show
other networks

431
00:18:35,196 --> 00:18:36,836 A:middle
so I can select a
different network if I like.

432
00:18:36,836 --> 00:18:38,866 A:middle
And then I can rename it.

433
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:40,866 A:middle
If I click on the name--
accessory name section,

434
00:18:40,946 --> 00:18:43,236 A:middle
I can decide I want to call it
something other than Thermostat.

435
00:18:43,546 --> 00:18:45,756 A:middle
I want to call it, you know,
Back Bedroom Thermostat

436
00:18:45,756 --> 00:18:48,246 A:middle
or Garage Thermostat or
somewhere else that I want it.

437
00:18:49,256 --> 00:18:52,756 A:middle
Then I click Next,
voila, lo and behold,

438
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:56,426 A:middle
we securely transfer all the
networking credentials including

439
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,566 A:middle
the passwords and anything
else that user may not remember

440
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

441
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,006 A:middle
down to the accessory.

442
00:19:01,396 --> 00:19:04,826 A:middle
The accessory rejoins the
target network and you're done.

443
00:19:06,026 --> 00:19:06,916 A:middle
We do have one more thing,

444
00:19:07,726 --> 00:19:09,286 A:middle
if that accessory
has an application,

445
00:19:09,446 --> 00:19:12,826 A:middle
we also allow you to-- the
consumer to click on Find

446
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:13,806 A:middle
Out for this Accessory.

447
00:19:13,806 --> 00:19:16,406 A:middle
It will do a search and take
you directly to the App Store

448
00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:18,866 A:middle
and they can be off on their
way again without having

449
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,626 A:middle
to open the manual,
without having

450
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:22,266 A:middle
to think anymore about it.

451
00:19:22,826 --> 00:19:25,156 A:middle
Of course, we don't want to
leave Mavericks out of this.

452
00:19:25,786 --> 00:19:30,646 A:middle
So, we also have the ability
to go up to the Wi-Fi menu,

453
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:34,556 A:middle
obviously you see new accessory
up there, same choices,

454
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:36,166 A:middle
you select Thermostat,

455
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:40,576 A:middle
or AirPort updater
program launches.

456
00:19:40,906 --> 00:19:42,866 A:middle
You have the ability to
select both of them there.

457
00:19:43,376 --> 00:19:47,456 A:middle
Again, chose your network,
rename if you so please

458
00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:49,826 A:middle
and you're also on
the network there.

459
00:19:49,826 --> 00:19:51,776 A:middle
So, whether you're
using Mavericks

460
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:53,126 A:middle
or whether you're using iOS 7,

461
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:55,896 A:middle
your consumer now has the
ability to get on to the network

462
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:57,946 A:middle
in easy way only using Wi-Fi.

463
00:19:58,076 --> 00:19:58,896 A:middle
We think this is great.

464
00:19:58,896 --> 00:20:02,596 A:middle
It's going to be part of the MFi
Program and we're super excited

465
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

466
00:20:02,596 --> 00:20:05,656 A:middle
to have people come and talk to
us about how you implement this.

467
00:20:05,656 --> 00:20:06,726 A:middle
So please come and talk to us.

468
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:09,616 A:middle
Obviously, one of the
great things this pairs

469
00:20:09,616 --> 00:20:11,456 A:middle
with is AirPlay Audio
and we've talked

470
00:20:11,456 --> 00:20:12,986 A:middle
about AirPlay Audio a
little bit in the past.

471
00:20:13,406 --> 00:20:14,596 A:middle
It's a third-party program.

472
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:17,416 A:middle
It is part of MFi that allows
you to configure the device

473
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:21,486 A:middle
and have it be part of
our AirPlay ecosystem

474
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,696 A:middle
so you can stream audio
to the third-party device.

475
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:27,956 A:middle
We have audio/video receivers,
speaker docks, television.

476
00:20:27,956 --> 00:20:31,466 A:middle
We have all sorts of things
in this expansive ecosystem

477
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:32,656 A:middle
that allows you to listen

478
00:20:32,656 --> 00:20:34,686 A:middle
to your music how you
see it fit as a consumer.

479
00:20:35,486 --> 00:20:37,396 A:middle
But we've had one
little snuck in the past.

480
00:20:37,396 --> 00:20:39,206 A:middle
It's been a little
restrictive perhaps.

481
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:41,126 A:middle
So I'm happy to announce

482
00:20:41,426 --> 00:20:44,066 A:middle
that we're also transferring
this into a more program.

483
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:48,066 A:middle
We're going to look at
essentially enabling all of you

484
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:52,546 A:middle
to develop and create
AirPlay accessories

485
00:20:52,546 --> 00:20:53,876 A:middle
on whatever platform,

486
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:55,656 A:middle
on whatever hardware
platform you see fit.

487
00:20:55,926 --> 00:20:59,336 A:middle
It's the same program,
same product definitions,

488
00:20:59,336 --> 00:21:03,486 A:middle
same feature set, same terms
of compliance, same everything.

489
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

490
00:21:03,656 --> 00:21:04,596 A:middle
It's just that now you get

491
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,056 A:middle
to choose whatever
hardware you would

492
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:09,206 A:middle
like to enable your AirPlay
accessories and hopefully,

493
00:21:09,206 --> 00:21:11,466 A:middle
that will give you guys a
little bit more flexibility

494
00:21:11,766 --> 00:21:13,876 A:middle
and we'll expand that
ecosystem even further.

495
00:21:15,386 --> 00:21:16,796 A:middle
With that, thank you.

496
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:18,866 A:middle
I'd like to bring in my
colleague, Brian Tucker,

497
00:21:19,276 --> 00:21:21,426 A:middle
to talk a little bit more
about Bluetooth and some

498
00:21:21,426 --> 00:21:22,416 A:middle
of the exciting things
we have there.

499
00:21:22,806 --> 00:21:23,876 A:middle
Thanks guys.

500
00:21:23,876 --> 00:21:24,406 A:middle
[Applause]

501
00:21:24,406 --> 00:21:24,906 A:middle
>> All right.

502
00:21:25,236 --> 00:21:25,976 A:middle
Thank you, Peter.

503
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:30,096 A:middle
My name is Brian Tucker and
I am ultimately responsible

504
00:21:30,096 --> 00:21:33,436 A:middle
for Bluetooth at Apple
and that includes iOS

505
00:21:33,936 --> 00:21:37,186 A:middle
and now OS X Mavericks.

506
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:42,946 A:middle
And I have an incredible honor,
the guys gave me the opportunity

507
00:21:42,946 --> 00:21:46,016 A:middle
to come up and talk about
what's next for Bluetooth,

508
00:21:46,016 --> 00:21:48,816 A:middle
what are we doing with
Bluetooth now, what's the state

509
00:21:48,816 --> 00:21:50,096 A:middle
of the union of Bluetooth?

510
00:21:50,436 --> 00:21:53,166 A:middle
I'm obviously very, very
passionate about this.

511
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,606 A:middle
I've actually had the
opportunity to meet a lot of you

512
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,616 A:middle
in the audience here today.

513
00:21:57,986 --> 00:22:00,356 A:middle
We do have a followup
session to this

514
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

515
00:22:00,356 --> 00:22:04,076 A:middle
that specifically covers Core
Bluetooth in a lot more detail.

516
00:22:04,446 --> 00:22:08,046 A:middle
And so what I'm going to do in
this session is give you kind

517
00:22:08,046 --> 00:22:11,946 A:middle
of a sneak peak at some of the
things that we've done specially

518
00:22:11,946 --> 00:22:15,716 A:middle
in iOS 7 to really take Core
Bluetooth to the next level.

519
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:17,996 A:middle
So where's Bluetooth today?

520
00:22:17,996 --> 00:22:21,636 A:middle
Well, Bluetooth is
over a decade old.

521
00:22:21,816 --> 00:22:24,856 A:middle
In fact, it's about 12
or 13 years old now.

522
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,856 A:middle
Core Bluetooth or Bluetooth
low energy just came

523
00:22:27,856 --> 00:22:30,676 A:middle
in the market a couple of
years ago, three years ago.

524
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,786 A:middle
This marks our third iteration

525
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:36,136 A:middle
of Bluetooth low
energy implementations

526
00:22:36,136 --> 00:22:38,926 A:middle
in Apple products,
but what's going on?

527
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:41,816 A:middle
This last year was crazy.

528
00:22:42,046 --> 00:22:43,476 A:middle
[laughs] It was nuts.

529
00:22:43,476 --> 00:22:47,796 A:middle
I mean, one of things that
blew me away is in the SIG,

530
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:52,116 A:middle
we saw 451 percent
increase in listed devices

531
00:22:52,116 --> 00:22:53,286 A:middle
for Bluetooth speakers.

532
00:22:53,286 --> 00:22:54,836 A:middle
I mean that's just nuts.

533
00:22:54,836 --> 00:22:56,886 A:middle
If you look at the
chart, it kind of grows,

534
00:22:56,886 --> 00:22:59,216 A:middle
and then last year, it's
just this hockey puck.

535
00:22:59,756 --> 00:23:01,406 A:middle
And this year is no different.

536
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

537
00:23:01,406 --> 00:23:04,046 A:middle
We're seeing more and
more devices get listed

538
00:23:04,046 --> 00:23:06,716 A:middle
in the classic Bluetooth space.

539
00:23:06,716 --> 00:23:10,336 A:middle
So classic Bluetooth, it
is definitely here to stay.

540
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,906 A:middle
It is still growing
by leaps and bounds.

541
00:23:13,116 --> 00:23:14,616 A:middle
We want to continue to improve

542
00:23:14,616 --> 00:23:16,546 A:middle
that user experience
with customers.

543
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:18,166 A:middle
You know, we want to do this

544
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,716 A:middle
like make AC perform
even better,

545
00:23:20,906 --> 00:23:24,826 A:middle
perform better coax algorithms,
to improve audio quality

546
00:23:24,826 --> 00:23:26,356 A:middle
for conversational audio.

547
00:23:26,726 --> 00:23:29,336 A:middle
All those areas around
Core Bluetooth that are key

548
00:23:29,336 --> 00:23:32,066 A:middle
to the customer experience,
we want to make better.

549
00:23:32,306 --> 00:23:35,186 A:middle
And what we're doing with you
guys is we're updating our

550
00:23:35,186 --> 00:23:38,426 A:middle
Bluetooth Guidelines document
to make better suggestions

551
00:23:38,426 --> 00:23:41,986 A:middle
about how to implement
hands-free and HTTP devices,

552
00:23:42,226 --> 00:23:46,776 A:middle
as well as make improvements
on [inaudible] in OS X and iOS.

553
00:23:46,776 --> 00:23:47,596 A:middle
It's pretty cool.

554
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,396 A:middle
So Bluetooth low
energy, obviously,

555
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:51,926 A:middle
I just spoke of,
it's pretty new.

556
00:23:52,006 --> 00:23:54,086 A:middle
It's only been around
four, three years.

557
00:23:54,086 --> 00:23:59,536 A:middle
But what's amazing is in a few
market reports that I've read

558
00:23:59,536 --> 00:24:01,636 A:middle
and have been provided
to the Bluetooth SIG,

559
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

560
00:24:02,196 --> 00:24:05,806 A:middle
we're going to surpass a billion
Bluetooth low energy devices

561
00:24:05,856 --> 00:24:06,326 A:middle
this year.

562
00:24:06,886 --> 00:24:08,046 A:middle
That's ridiculous.

563
00:24:08,386 --> 00:24:12,096 A:middle
A Bluetooth-- a billion
Bluetooth low energy devices

564
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:14,766 A:middle
with a technology that
realistically has only been

565
00:24:14,766 --> 00:24:16,076 A:middle
around for a couple of years.

566
00:24:16,766 --> 00:24:17,736 A:middle
That's insane.

567
00:24:18,126 --> 00:24:20,086 A:middle
So clearly, this
is a huge market

568
00:24:20,086 --> 00:24:21,416 A:middle
for you guys to step into.

569
00:24:22,466 --> 00:24:25,666 A:middle
And then finally, and I think
this is pretty important,

570
00:24:26,026 --> 00:24:29,856 A:middle
is that now every major mobile
OS manufacturer supports

571
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:31,136 A:middle
Bluetooth low energy.

572
00:24:31,806 --> 00:24:34,256 A:middle
So I like to personally
welcome them to the pool,

573
00:24:34,396 --> 00:24:37,536 A:middle
the water is great,
but this is awesome

574
00:24:37,536 --> 00:24:40,456 A:middle
because this now gives you
the ability to truly look

575
00:24:40,456 --> 00:24:43,156 A:middle
at a technology across
the entire spectrum

576
00:24:43,156 --> 00:24:44,176 A:middle
of mobile devices.

577
00:24:44,576 --> 00:24:48,356 A:middle
So no longer is it just our
play, we're going to continue

578
00:24:48,356 --> 00:24:49,876 A:middle
to drive this market forward.

579
00:24:49,986 --> 00:24:52,576 A:middle
We're going to continue
to innovate in this space,

580
00:24:52,576 --> 00:24:54,056 A:middle
but I think it's
important to note

581
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:57,726 A:middle
that everybody feels the same
way about Bluetooth low energy

582
00:24:57,936 --> 00:25:00,046 A:middle
that we do, which I think
is really, really cool.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

584
00:25:57,686 --> 00:26:00,256 A:middle
And we wanted to kind of put
our money where our mouth is.

585
00:26:00,256 --> 00:26:04,206 A:middle
We wanted to say, "If these
are so important to you guys,

586
00:26:04,266 --> 00:26:06,526 A:middle
if we're saying that
these are super important,

587
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,406 A:middle
then what can we do to
make these even better?"

588
00:26:10,056 --> 00:26:12,706 A:middle
So, I wanted to highlight a
few of these particular areas.

589
00:26:12,706 --> 00:26:13,866 A:middle
I'm not going to
through all of these.

590
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:14,856 A:middle
I don't have enough time.

591
00:26:15,276 --> 00:26:18,376 A:middle
But I want to highlight a
few things that we've done

592
00:26:18,746 --> 00:26:21,006 A:middle
to make some of these user
experiences even better.

593
00:26:21,006 --> 00:26:22,986 A:middle
And the first one I want to
talk about is health care.

594
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:27,776 A:middle
And like Peter said, health care
is growing by leaps and downs.

595
00:26:27,776 --> 00:26:29,726 A:middle
If you look at what
we're doing with LE,

596
00:26:29,726 --> 00:26:33,846 A:middle
we're allowing the consumer
to quantify themselves.

597
00:26:33,846 --> 00:26:36,896 A:middle
I'm not sure I like this
concept called quantify itself,

598
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:38,116 A:middle
but the-- or the name.

599
00:26:38,116 --> 00:26:39,176 A:middle
I love the concept.

600
00:26:39,176 --> 00:26:40,586 A:middle
And the idea is that you

601
00:26:40,586 --> 00:26:44,066 A:middle
as a consumer can now
take active control

602
00:26:44,066 --> 00:26:45,096 A:middle
over your own health care.

603
00:26:45,466 --> 00:26:47,296 A:middle
You can monitor your
own blood glucose.

604
00:26:47,296 --> 00:26:48,736 A:middle
You can monitor your
own heart rate.

605
00:26:49,096 --> 00:26:52,746 A:middle
I saw a product that monitors
your blood glucose level

606
00:26:52,876 --> 00:26:56,656 A:middle
and actually gives you real-time
body chemistry information

607
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:57,906 A:middle
as you eat your food.

608
00:26:58,396 --> 00:27:01,626 A:middle
So, like you can go eat a bagel
and your phone will tell you,

609
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

610
00:27:01,906 --> 00:27:04,356 A:middle
"Dude, your blood sugar level
is spiking, you may not want

611
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:06,656 A:middle
to have any carbs for lunch,"
you know, kind of thing.

612
00:27:07,056 --> 00:27:11,226 A:middle
And that's awesome, 'cause now
I can immediately know how the

613
00:27:11,226 --> 00:27:12,926 A:middle
system is operating, right?

614
00:27:12,996 --> 00:27:15,646 A:middle
And as an engineer, that's
huge, [inaudible], right?

615
00:27:15,646 --> 00:27:20,576 A:middle
And if I have data on my body,
I can make the right choices

616
00:27:20,576 --> 00:27:24,796 A:middle
in real-time as I go out
throughout my day, huge,

617
00:27:24,796 --> 00:27:27,846 A:middle
huge opportunity
here in this market.

618
00:27:28,796 --> 00:27:31,446 A:middle
Another area is providing
a better relationship

619
00:27:31,446 --> 00:27:33,286 A:middle
between the patient
and the care provider,

620
00:27:33,696 --> 00:27:35,486 A:middle
the nurse practitioner
or your doctor.

621
00:27:35,956 --> 00:27:39,996 A:middle
And connecting the device
that's on your body with the iOS

622
00:27:40,156 --> 00:27:42,796 A:middle
or the OS X device
and connecting

623
00:27:42,796 --> 00:27:44,316 A:middle
that to your doctor directly.

624
00:27:44,316 --> 00:27:48,546 A:middle
So now, the doctor can take
an active role in your life

625
00:27:48,546 --> 00:27:51,016 A:middle
without you having to be in
the hospital the whole time.

626
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:55,936 A:middle
And for my parents, especially,
it even gives me the ability

627
00:27:55,936 --> 00:27:57,776 A:middle
to monitor their
health remotely.

628
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:01,846 A:middle
They live in Arizona, I live
in California, it's just peace

629
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

630
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,036 A:middle
of mind, but they
can still continue

631
00:28:04,036 --> 00:28:05,826 A:middle
to live their lives
the way they want to.

632
00:28:05,826 --> 00:28:08,226 A:middle
I think that's just huge.

633
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:10,116 A:middle
It changes the world, right?

634
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,356 A:middle
Another area where
we're kind of--

635
00:28:12,356 --> 00:28:14,686 A:middle
we put our money where
our mouth is this idea

636
00:28:14,686 --> 00:28:17,946 A:middle
of MFi hearing aids, or
Apple designed hearing aid

637
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,086 A:middle
audio transport.

638
00:28:19,946 --> 00:28:24,026 A:middle
Now, about a year and a
half ago, we were looking

639
00:28:24,026 --> 00:28:25,986 A:middle
at this space and
we're like, you know,

640
00:28:25,986 --> 00:28:29,806 A:middle
Bluetooth is being used but
the experience is just less

641
00:28:29,806 --> 00:28:30,536 A:middle
than ideal.

642
00:28:30,806 --> 00:28:32,526 A:middle
You had to wear something
around your neck,

643
00:28:32,526 --> 00:28:34,366 A:middle
or you had to wear a
thing on your belt,

644
00:28:34,726 --> 00:28:38,776 A:middle
and it was like Bluetooth
that and magnetic inductance

645
00:28:38,776 --> 00:28:42,646 A:middle
to your hearing aid, or
you put it up to your ear

646
00:28:42,646 --> 00:28:44,176 A:middle
and it just sounded
really crappy.

647
00:28:44,176 --> 00:28:46,166 A:middle
And we're like, "We
can make this better."

648
00:28:46,836 --> 00:28:49,526 A:middle
And so, we first started looking
at Bluetooth and like, "No,

649
00:28:49,756 --> 00:28:51,926 A:middle
that's not going to
work, too much power,

650
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:55,326 A:middle
the chips are too
expensive, they're too big."

651
00:28:55,326 --> 00:28:58,126 A:middle
And then we started
looking at low energy,

652
00:28:58,126 --> 00:29:00,206 A:middle
and I remember having
conversations

653
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

654
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:03,066 A:middle
with some chip guys and they
literally laughed at us,

655
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:05,716 A:middle
you know, they didn't think
that that is even possible.

656
00:29:06,556 --> 00:29:08,886 A:middle
But we hammered it
and we hammered it,

657
00:29:08,886 --> 00:29:12,006 A:middle
and we came up with
a way to push audio

658
00:29:12,216 --> 00:29:15,346 A:middle
down to lower energy link,
and this is Apple iP.

659
00:29:15,346 --> 00:29:18,386 A:middle
And we're enabling the
hearing aid market.

660
00:29:18,386 --> 00:29:21,556 A:middle
In fact this year, we'll
start seeing hearing aids

661
00:29:21,556 --> 00:29:25,496 A:middle
on the market using this
technology, and it's crazy tool.

662
00:29:25,586 --> 00:29:28,806 A:middle
I mean, we'll start to see this
technology in cochlear implants,

663
00:29:29,036 --> 00:29:31,916 A:middle
where you technically have
an audio linked directly

664
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:33,566 A:middle
from your phone into your brain.

665
00:29:33,816 --> 00:29:36,826 A:middle
I mean, it's just
nutty technology.

666
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,446 A:middle
And it's also a data pipe.

667
00:29:38,936 --> 00:29:41,466 A:middle
So, not only that we're
pushing audio to your ears

668
00:29:41,766 --> 00:29:45,046 A:middle
but the doctor-- you can call
up the doctor, talk to them

669
00:29:45,046 --> 00:29:48,456 A:middle
on the phone and they can adjust
your hearing aids over the phone

670
00:29:48,736 --> 00:29:53,136 A:middle
as you're talking to them,
just awesome, awesome stuff.

671
00:29:53,136 --> 00:29:55,196 A:middle
So this is what I
mean about kind

672
00:29:55,196 --> 00:29:56,596 A:middle
of putting our money
where our mouth is.

673
00:29:56,596 --> 00:29:59,116 A:middle
And then finally--
and this is one

674
00:29:59,116 --> 00:30:01,396 A:middle
of those sneak peeks
I'm giving you based

675
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

676
00:30:01,396 --> 00:30:05,056 A:middle
on our Core Bluetooth session,
but this idea of improved--

677
00:30:05,156 --> 00:30:06,966 A:middle
we improved Core
Bluetooth backgrounding.

678
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:12,206 A:middle
So now with app preservation and
restoration, we give the ability

679
00:30:12,326 --> 00:30:14,976 A:middle
to launch apps in the
background and interact

680
00:30:14,976 --> 00:30:17,576 A:middle
with Bluetooth low
energy devices regardless

681
00:30:17,576 --> 00:30:18,976 A:middle
of the state of your
application.

682
00:30:19,466 --> 00:30:24,376 A:middle
So this gives a whole new
market of interaction especially

683
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:28,116 A:middle
in areas of long-term care and
some of the areas I want to talk

684
00:30:28,116 --> 00:30:28,966 A:middle
about here in a minute.

685
00:30:29,096 --> 00:30:32,906 A:middle
So sports and fitness
is the next area.

686
00:30:33,226 --> 00:30:35,846 A:middle
Now sports and fitness seems
to be completely designed

687
00:30:35,846 --> 00:30:36,936 A:middle
for Bluetooth low energy.

688
00:30:37,386 --> 00:30:40,596 A:middle
Some of the products that
we've seen in the market

689
00:30:40,596 --> 00:30:45,766 A:middle
and the space, the Fitbit Flex,
a Bluetooth low energy product.

690
00:30:45,766 --> 00:30:46,816 A:middle
This is really cool.

691
00:30:46,816 --> 00:30:48,466 A:middle
It monitors your activity,

692
00:30:48,636 --> 00:30:50,616 A:middle
but it also monitors
your sleep cycles.

693
00:30:50,656 --> 00:30:52,516 A:middle
So it tells you how
well you slept,

694
00:30:53,106 --> 00:30:55,516 A:middle
as well as how sedentary
your life is.

695
00:30:55,516 --> 00:30:58,016 A:middle
As an engineer, I struggle
with this constantly.

696
00:30:58,436 --> 00:31:02,816 A:middle
But it says, "Get off your
butt and go exercise."

697
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

698
00:31:02,816 --> 00:31:03,676 A:middle
It's a great product.

699
00:31:04,606 --> 00:31:08,516 A:middle
This is one that I'm especially
excited about with my kids.

700
00:31:08,516 --> 00:31:11,526 A:middle
This is soccer ball made by
Adidas, the Adidas Smart Ball.

701
00:31:11,526 --> 00:31:14,846 A:middle
What's cool about this is it
has Bluetooth low energy radio

702
00:31:14,846 --> 00:31:17,546 A:middle
in the middle and then
sensors that spider

703
00:31:17,546 --> 00:31:19,366 A:middle
out to the outside of the ball.

704
00:31:19,366 --> 00:31:21,676 A:middle
It looks like a spider
exploded inside the ball, right?

705
00:31:21,676 --> 00:31:23,556 A:middle
And it is connected to the ball

706
00:31:23,556 --> 00:31:25,396 A:middle
and it actually monitors
the activity

707
00:31:25,396 --> 00:31:28,036 A:middle
of the soccer ball during use.

708
00:31:28,036 --> 00:31:31,066 A:middle
So it monitors how well
you're passing a ball.

709
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,066 A:middle
How much spin you're
putting on the ball.

710
00:31:33,066 --> 00:31:36,686 A:middle
In fact, it a has feature
where you take a shot on goal

711
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,226 A:middle
and if you're looking
particular curve to the shot,

712
00:31:39,586 --> 00:31:42,876 A:middle
it will monitor that curve
and then compare your shot

713
00:31:42,876 --> 00:31:46,056 A:middle
against a pro shot and it will
actually tell how well you're

714
00:31:46,056 --> 00:31:47,526 A:middle
doing against maybe Beckham.

715
00:31:47,526 --> 00:31:50,766 A:middle
And you want this, that cool,
you know, right to left curve

716
00:31:50,766 --> 00:31:53,696 A:middle
into the top-right or
top-left corner of the goal.

717
00:31:53,696 --> 00:31:55,436 A:middle
This ball will let you do that.

718
00:31:55,436 --> 00:31:59,966 A:middle
So for coaches, this is huge
because it gives you the data.

719
00:31:59,966 --> 00:32:03,166 A:middle
In addition to that in
basketball, there is a product

720
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

721
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:06,976 A:middle
by 94Fifty, a smart ball that
does very similar things,

722
00:32:06,976 --> 00:32:08,796 A:middle
but in a basketball space.

723
00:32:09,056 --> 00:32:12,276 A:middle
You take a shot, it tells
you the rotation of the ball,

724
00:32:12,506 --> 00:32:15,666 A:middle
it tells you the shot angle
of the ball to the goal,

725
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:17,036 A:middle
how well you're dribbling.

726
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:18,616 A:middle
I mean, it's awesome.

727
00:32:18,616 --> 00:32:21,146 A:middle
And that somebody like
that's a data junky,

728
00:32:21,396 --> 00:32:24,096 A:middle
this is just a really, really
great way to get feedback

729
00:32:24,096 --> 00:32:25,506 A:middle
on how well you're doing,

730
00:32:25,766 --> 00:32:29,346 A:middle
as well as how well
your athletes are doing

731
00:32:29,346 --> 00:32:30,116 A:middle
if you're a coach.

732
00:32:30,526 --> 00:32:31,476 A:middle
Really, really cool.

733
00:32:32,316 --> 00:32:36,686 A:middle
And so, again, we feel like with
iOS 7 in the app preservation,

734
00:32:36,946 --> 00:32:40,086 A:middle
you can now do long-term
accessory interaction.

735
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,876 A:middle
Now there is a lot to
be talked about in here

736
00:32:43,026 --> 00:32:45,116 A:middle
and a lot more detail in
the Core Bluetooth session.

737
00:32:45,426 --> 00:32:48,616 A:middle
Reno [phonetic] and Jason go in
this in great detail and talk

738
00:32:48,616 --> 00:32:51,416 A:middle
about how your apps
can really interact

739
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:53,826 A:middle
with these devices
long-term always.

740
00:32:53,826 --> 00:32:57,176 A:middle
As long as the phone is with the
consumer, the phone can interact

741
00:32:57,176 --> 00:32:58,216 A:middle
with these accessories.

742
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,896 A:middle
So the third thing is security

743
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

744
00:33:01,386 --> 00:33:05,326 A:middle
and security is kind
of snuck up on us.

745
00:33:05,326 --> 00:33:07,056 A:middle
Security has just exploded.

746
00:33:07,056 --> 00:33:10,686 A:middle
In fact, just recently, we're
starting to see just a ton

747
00:33:10,686 --> 00:33:16,956 A:middle
of products in the space that
are providing you experiences

748
00:33:16,956 --> 00:33:20,146 A:middle
around home similar to
the experiences you get

749
00:33:20,146 --> 00:33:23,646 A:middle
around your car with a
wireless remote or wireless key.

750
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:28,516 A:middle
Kwikset Kevo is a similar
product, you walk up,

751
00:33:28,516 --> 00:33:30,166 A:middle
your phone interacts
with the door,

752
00:33:30,396 --> 00:33:33,426 A:middle
you touch the door
lock and it unlocks.

753
00:33:33,426 --> 00:33:37,686 A:middle
This is a Kickstarter,
guys, Lockitron where--

754
00:33:37,686 --> 00:33:39,676 A:middle
a product where it just
goes over the door lock

755
00:33:39,676 --> 00:33:43,106 A:middle
and it can open and
unlock the door lock.

756
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:45,876 A:middle
And then just recently,
just a couple of weeks ago,

757
00:33:46,096 --> 00:33:48,586 A:middle
a company called August
makes up Smart Lock

758
00:33:48,836 --> 00:33:51,646 A:middle
that does very similar
things, beautiful product.

759
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,806 A:middle
One of the things in their video
I thought was really cool is

760
00:33:54,806 --> 00:33:58,556 A:middle
this idea of being able to
share your key virtually.

761
00:33:58,946 --> 00:34:01,136 A:middle
So if I want to allow
my plumber, for example,

762
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

763
00:34:01,136 --> 00:34:04,056 A:middle
to get in my home,
let's say this Thursday

764
00:34:04,056 --> 00:34:06,746 A:middle
which I know I'm not going
to be there from 12 to 2,

765
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:10,755 A:middle
I can send him my key and say,
"You can get into my home only

766
00:34:10,755 --> 00:34:12,835 A:middle
from 12 to 2" and
oh, by the way,

767
00:34:12,835 --> 00:34:15,406 A:middle
when he does enter the
home, his phone tells me

768
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,235 A:middle
that he entered the
home and left the home.

769
00:34:17,525 --> 00:34:20,005 A:middle
It's pretty really,
really, really cool stuff.

770
00:34:20,005 --> 00:34:22,295 A:middle
And, again, we think
state preservation

771
00:34:22,295 --> 00:34:26,036 A:middle
and restoration is key here
because if the app goes away

772
00:34:26,036 --> 00:34:28,235 A:middle
or dies, you don't
have the ability

773
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:30,065 A:middle
to unlock your door, right?

774
00:34:30,065 --> 00:34:31,835 A:middle
It doesn't interact
with the door

775
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:34,025 A:middle
because the app is
no longer there.

776
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:37,686 A:middle
And iOS doesn't a have perceived
knowledge of what it means

777
00:34:37,686 --> 00:34:38,826 A:middle
to interact with the door lock.

778
00:34:39,065 --> 00:34:42,866 A:middle
So this is really, really,
really key to this product space

779
00:34:42,866 --> 00:34:46,446 A:middle
and we think that this is going
to just explode this market.

780
00:34:48,156 --> 00:34:54,235 A:middle
Entertainment, so briefly Peter
covered this, but I just wanted

781
00:34:54,235 --> 00:34:56,466 A:middle
to cover a couple of
areas where entertainment

782
00:34:56,466 --> 00:34:58,636 A:middle
and low energy is converging.

783
00:34:58,746 --> 00:35:01,166 A:middle
Game controller is
obviously an area

784
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

785
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:04,746 A:middle
where Bluetooth low energy
is perfect for this space.

786
00:35:05,076 --> 00:35:09,476 A:middle
The small data packet
sizes, the data intervals,

787
00:35:09,476 --> 00:35:10,836 A:middle
the connection intervals

788
00:35:10,836 --> 00:35:13,126 A:middle
that you can achieve
just perfectly aligned

789
00:35:13,126 --> 00:35:14,196 A:middle
with game controllers.

790
00:35:14,486 --> 00:35:18,106 A:middle
Obviously, keyboards, I'm not
sure keyboards are entertaining,

791
00:35:18,106 --> 00:35:21,706 A:middle
but you can connect to
keyboards maybe to play games

792
00:35:21,706 --> 00:35:24,216 A:middle
that are a little
bit more complicated,

793
00:35:24,526 --> 00:35:26,196 A:middle
and then of course,
remote controls.

794
00:35:26,506 --> 00:35:29,986 A:middle
Like this remote control
potentially can be LE

795
00:35:29,986 --> 00:35:34,166 A:middle
and probably should be LE given
that this could connect directly

796
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:38,466 A:middle
to an iO-- or an Apple product.

797
00:35:38,466 --> 00:35:40,706 A:middle
So, what have we
done in this space?

798
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:44,206 A:middle
Well, now on iOS 7, we
natively support HID

799
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:46,086 A:middle
over BLE accessories.

800
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:49,686 A:middle
So now, if you make
a BLE keyboard,

801
00:35:49,686 --> 00:35:55,986 A:middle
you can connect directly to
iOS and to OS X Mavericks.

802
00:35:56,286 --> 00:35:59,816 A:middle
And what's important to
note here especially, well,

803
00:35:59,816 --> 00:36:03,156 A:middle
in both platforms is
this is the first time

804
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

805
00:36:03,426 --> 00:36:07,276 A:middle
that we have supported
profiles in the LE space.

806
00:36:07,756 --> 00:36:12,486 A:middle
That means that device
management is now being managed

807
00:36:12,946 --> 00:36:16,716 A:middle
by the OS, but that doesn't
take away device management

808
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:17,926 A:middle
from your apps.

809
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:20,626 A:middle
So if your apps still want to
discover devices and connect

810
00:36:20,626 --> 00:36:23,316 A:middle
to them and interact with
them, they can totally do that.

811
00:36:23,316 --> 00:36:24,346 A:middle
That's totally fine.

812
00:36:24,686 --> 00:36:29,356 A:middle
But the case of hosted
profiles such as HID over GATT,

813
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:34,156 A:middle
we now managed those
devices for you.

814
00:36:34,516 --> 00:36:37,786 A:middle
So we felt like it's a more
of a system level functionally

815
00:36:37,786 --> 00:36:39,886 A:middle
and we thought it
was important for us

816
00:36:39,886 --> 00:36:41,566 A:middle
to put this into the product.

817
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:44,086 A:middle
And then finally, proximity,

818
00:36:44,086 --> 00:36:47,356 A:middle
and this has been talked
about a little bit.

819
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,556 A:middle
I've had countless
questions, people like,

820
00:36:50,556 --> 00:36:52,026 A:middle
"What's this iBeacons thing?"

821
00:36:52,026 --> 00:36:53,576 A:middle
You know, all those
kind of stuff.

822
00:36:53,576 --> 00:36:55,726 A:middle
So, I wanted to briefly
talk about this.

823
00:36:55,726 --> 00:36:58,796 A:middle
Some of the areas
where proximity is key,

824
00:36:58,796 --> 00:37:00,786 A:middle
we already talked
about security,

825
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

826
00:37:01,206 --> 00:37:05,796 A:middle
advertising the ability
to go into a retail space,

827
00:37:06,006 --> 00:37:08,666 A:middle
and my phone starts to
interact with that retail space

828
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:10,046 A:middle
in an advertising way.

829
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:13,096 A:middle
I think Minority Report, but
hopefully not that creepy.

830
00:37:13,386 --> 00:37:18,676 A:middle
Location services,
obviously, if I'm up--

831
00:37:18,676 --> 00:37:20,586 A:middle
going up to a statue
[phonetic] and I want

832
00:37:20,586 --> 00:37:23,136 A:middle
that statue do tell me something
about the points of interest,

833
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:24,446 A:middle
that's really interesting.

834
00:37:24,526 --> 00:37:26,766 A:middle
So what have we done
in this space?

835
00:37:26,826 --> 00:37:32,926 A:middle
Well, now, natively, we give
you the ability to do this iOS

836
00:37:32,926 --> 00:37:35,516 A:middle
to iOS built right
within core location.

837
00:37:35,806 --> 00:37:37,446 A:middle
And this is using
Bluetooth low energy.

838
00:37:37,446 --> 00:37:40,126 A:middle
We don't make it obvious that
it's using Bluetooth low energy.

839
00:37:40,126 --> 00:37:44,056 A:middle
But then you have the ability
to engage from consumer

840
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:46,406 A:middle
to consumer, iOS
device to iOS device,

841
00:37:46,456 --> 00:37:47,966 A:middle
these proximity services.

842
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:54,716 A:middle
So that's just a few areas that
we've been working on in iOS 7.

843
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,766 A:middle
So as a review, these are some
of the new things that we talked

844
00:37:58,766 --> 00:38:01,746 A:middle
about here, Core Bluetooth
App Preservation Restoration.

845
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

846
00:38:02,056 --> 00:38:04,766 A:middle
I know it's an interesting
name, but it's really cool.

847
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:05,836 A:middle
Learn about it.

848
00:38:05,836 --> 00:38:06,936 A:middle
It will change your life.

849
00:38:07,476 --> 00:38:10,896 A:middle
BLE based proximity services,
we talked about this already.

850
00:38:11,196 --> 00:38:15,676 A:middle
iOS hosted BLE profiles,
HID over BLE.

851
00:38:15,676 --> 00:38:16,896 A:middle
That should be HID over GATT.

852
00:38:16,896 --> 00:38:17,806 A:middle
It was the official name.

853
00:38:17,806 --> 00:38:20,016 A:middle
And then finally,
hearing aid support

854
00:38:20,356 --> 00:38:24,096 A:middle
which we think is
hugely profound

855
00:38:24,096 --> 00:38:27,676 A:middle
and truly does make a difference
in the world which is one

856
00:38:27,676 --> 00:38:29,856 A:middle
of our mission statements
in wireless software

857
00:38:30,146 --> 00:38:31,836 A:middle
and we think this fulfills that.

858
00:38:32,436 --> 00:38:34,646 A:middle
Real quick, this is kind
of our state of the union.

859
00:38:34,936 --> 00:38:38,456 A:middle
This is the classic Bluetooth
protocols and profiles

860
00:38:38,456 --> 00:38:41,806 A:middle
that we support in OS X.

861
00:38:42,016 --> 00:38:44,346 A:middle
You can write this
down real quick, no.

862
00:38:44,346 --> 00:38:47,516 A:middle
These are all available
and visible to you

863
00:38:47,516 --> 00:38:50,276 A:middle
in the current release
of Mavericks.

864
00:38:50,606 --> 00:38:54,436 A:middle
And then on the LE side, we
have a couple of new roles

865
00:38:54,436 --> 00:38:58,566 A:middle
on the LE side and that is
low energy peripheral role.

866
00:38:58,676 --> 00:39:01,516 A:middle
Apparently, we thought enough
about it to add it twice.

867
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

868
00:39:01,976 --> 00:39:05,676 A:middle
And-- but anyway, we did
give you the ability now

869
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,956 A:middle
to offer up services in OS X.

870
00:39:07,956 --> 00:39:12,876 A:middle
And now on the iOS side,
from a Core Bluetooth--

871
00:39:12,876 --> 00:39:15,836 A:middle
or from a classic Bluetooth
perspective, excuse me,

872
00:39:15,836 --> 00:39:18,486 A:middle
these are the profiles that
we're currently supporting.

873
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,936 A:middle
Nothing new here, just
a lot of bug fixes

874
00:39:20,936 --> 00:39:24,046 A:middle
and interrupt ability
changes to make our products,

875
00:39:24,046 --> 00:39:26,896 A:middle
our devices work better
with your products.

876
00:39:27,126 --> 00:39:30,286 A:middle
We also continue to support
the iPod accessory protocol

877
00:39:30,546 --> 00:39:34,916 A:middle
over Bluetooth and that's still
very much an active technology.

878
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:37,456 A:middle
I use it every day
when I go to sleep.

879
00:39:37,826 --> 00:39:41,306 A:middle
And then on the LE side, we have
a couple of new things there.

880
00:39:41,576 --> 00:39:44,906 A:middle
As I said before, Alert
Navigation Service.

881
00:39:45,086 --> 00:39:46,326 A:middle
We have this new thing,

882
00:39:46,586 --> 00:39:49,916 A:middle
brand new called Apple
Notification Center Service.

883
00:39:50,026 --> 00:39:52,496 A:middle
There is also going to
be documentation posted

884
00:39:52,496 --> 00:39:55,576 A:middle
to the developer site very,
very soon, hopefully today.

885
00:39:55,966 --> 00:39:57,916 A:middle
So check it out in
there and a lot

886
00:39:57,916 --> 00:39:59,416 A:middle
of this information
will be on that.

887
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:02,016 A:middle
And then finally, the
current time service is also

888
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

889
00:40:02,016 --> 00:40:02,906 A:middle
always available.

890
00:40:03,056 --> 00:40:06,466 A:middle
So if you have an accessory
and you want that accessory

891
00:40:06,466 --> 00:40:08,466 A:middle
to use an accurate
schedule or timer,

892
00:40:08,696 --> 00:40:10,946 A:middle
the timer in the phone is
always available to you.

893
00:40:11,106 --> 00:40:14,956 A:middle
So hopefully, that was a very
brief informative overview

894
00:40:14,956 --> 00:40:18,186 A:middle
of where Bluetooth is right
now within our OS products.

895
00:40:18,246 --> 00:40:21,616 A:middle
So with that, I'd like to
invite up Edwin Foo to run us

896
00:40:21,616 --> 00:40:23,706 A:middle
through Wired and to
continue our presentation.

897
00:40:23,776 --> 00:40:24,086 A:middle
Thank you.

898
00:40:24,196 --> 00:40:27,076 A:middle
>> All right everybody,
so you're still with us.

899
00:40:27,366 --> 00:40:31,096 A:middle
Thanks for holding up this
far throughout the talk.

900
00:40:31,786 --> 00:40:34,756 A:middle
I'm Edwin and I am going to
spend a few minutes talking

901
00:40:34,756 --> 00:40:38,146 A:middle
with you about some of the Wired
interfaces that are available

902
00:40:38,266 --> 00:40:41,296 A:middle
to accessory developers
for both iOS devices

903
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:44,126 A:middle
and Macs running OS X.

904
00:40:45,756 --> 00:40:47,446 A:middle
Let's start with Thunderbolt.

905
00:40:49,176 --> 00:40:50,236 A:middle
This has been around
for a while--

906
00:40:50,236 --> 00:40:51,736 A:middle
a little while now
and it has worked

907
00:40:51,736 --> 00:40:54,556 A:middle
out really well for
us on the Macs.

908
00:40:54,796 --> 00:40:57,836 A:middle
Thunderbolt is a high-speed
transport that's capable

909
00:40:57,836 --> 00:41:01,156 A:middle
of transferring both data and
[inaudible] digital video,

910
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

911
00:41:01,156 --> 00:41:06,136 A:middle
namely DisplayPort, at really
high speeds and it can handle--

912
00:41:06,136 --> 00:41:07,856 A:middle
it can handle, actually
be daisy chained

913
00:41:08,376 --> 00:41:12,196 A:middle
up to six devices per
port and carry power.

914
00:41:12,196 --> 00:41:14,666 A:middle
It's a bit of mouthful, but
in short what this means is

915
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:19,816 A:middle
that you can have high transfer
speeds, one cable from the Mac

916
00:41:20,226 --> 00:41:23,136 A:middle
to your Thunderbolt accessory
so there's no messed up cables.

917
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:27,456 A:middle
And, of course, once your
users have multiple Thunderbolt

918
00:41:27,556 --> 00:41:28,736 A:middle
peripherals hooked
up to their Mac,

919
00:41:29,256 --> 00:41:32,696 A:middle
you still don't have a messed
up cables going from the Mac

920
00:41:32,696 --> 00:41:34,126 A:middle
to every single Thunderbolt
peripheral.

921
00:41:36,516 --> 00:41:39,006 A:middle
For applications that require
really, really high speed,

922
00:41:39,006 --> 00:41:42,476 A:middle
mass storage really
comes to mind as well

923
00:41:42,476 --> 00:41:43,506 A:middle
as digital video of course.

924
00:41:44,096 --> 00:41:46,986 A:middle
Thunderbolt is a great choice
and we strongly consider

925
00:41:47,306 --> 00:41:52,426 A:middle
that you consider using it
in accessories like that.

926
00:41:54,016 --> 00:41:55,136 A:middle
So how do you get started?

927
00:41:55,136 --> 00:41:58,456 A:middle
Well, first, there is
a certification program

928
00:41:58,456 --> 00:41:58,996 A:middle
for Thunderbolt.

929
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:01,056 A:middle
And the reason

930
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

931
00:42:01,056 --> 00:42:02,826 A:middle
that certification
program is there is

932
00:42:02,826 --> 00:42:06,126 A:middle
that it helps ensure a really
high quality of offerings

933
00:42:06,126 --> 00:42:08,256 A:middle
to users and customers
out there.

934
00:42:08,256 --> 00:42:11,596 A:middle
They want to be able to buy
Thunderbolt peripherals,

935
00:42:11,776 --> 00:42:13,136 A:middle
plug them in, and
just have them work.

936
00:42:13,676 --> 00:42:17,016 A:middle
And that works in both
directions because it means

937
00:42:17,016 --> 00:42:19,086 A:middle
that as users and customers
get more comfortable

938
00:42:19,086 --> 00:42:22,696 A:middle
with Thunderbolt and depend on
it more and more, they'll begin

939
00:42:22,696 --> 00:42:23,526 A:middle
to think less and less

940
00:42:23,526 --> 00:42:26,856 A:middle
about buying your Thunderbolt
peripherals and wondering

941
00:42:26,856 --> 00:42:27,676 A:middle
if they'll work with Macs.

942
00:42:28,266 --> 00:42:30,446 A:middle
For those of you
who are interested

943
00:42:30,446 --> 00:42:32,416 A:middle
in buying device drivers
for Thunderbolt accessories,

944
00:42:33,346 --> 00:42:35,966 A:middle
refer to the Thunderbolt
Device Driver Programming Guide

945
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:37,466 A:middle
on the Apple Developer website.

946
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:42,426 A:middle
Next, I'd like to
talk about USB 3.0.

947
00:42:43,576 --> 00:42:46,546 A:middle
Most Macs today ship
with USB 3.0 ports.

948
00:42:46,956 --> 00:42:50,376 A:middle
And like Thunderbolt, USB
ports can also, of course,

949
00:42:50,376 --> 00:42:54,706 A:middle
provide power up to
900 milliamps of it

950
00:42:55,146 --> 00:42:58,176 A:middle
to your USB accessories
for power and charging.

951
00:42:59,516 --> 00:43:02,756 A:middle
USB throughput is
still quite fast,

952
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

953
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:05,326 A:middle
although not quite
as fast Thunderbolt.

954
00:43:06,206 --> 00:43:08,006 A:middle
And for those of
you who are thinking

955
00:43:08,006 --> 00:43:10,166 A:middle
of making USB mass
storage accessories,

956
00:43:10,576 --> 00:43:12,226 A:middle
we definitely recommend
that instead

957
00:43:12,226 --> 00:43:14,236 A:middle
of using the USB
Mass Storage Class,

958
00:43:14,776 --> 00:43:19,106 A:middle
please consider using the
USB Attached SCSI Class.

959
00:43:20,346 --> 00:43:24,976 A:middle
The performance is much
better and all Macs--

960
00:43:25,066 --> 00:43:28,316 A:middle
most Macs especially Macs
that will be shipping

961
00:43:28,316 --> 00:43:30,226 A:middle
with OS X Mavericks
will support this.

962
00:43:30,576 --> 00:43:33,646 A:middle
And last but not least,
we definitely recommend

963
00:43:33,646 --> 00:43:35,376 A:middle
that you have your
USB peripherals

964
00:43:35,786 --> 00:43:38,636 A:middle
and accessories certified
by the USB Integrators Form.

965
00:43:39,676 --> 00:43:43,166 A:middle
This will guarantee that your
accessories have maximum chance

966
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:45,706 A:middle
of working out of the box
without have additional--

967
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,416 A:middle
install additional
drivers with Macs

968
00:43:47,456 --> 00:43:49,576 A:middle
and OS X releases down the road.

969
00:43:50,446 --> 00:43:54,606 A:middle
Next, I'd like to give
brief overview of Lightning.

970
00:43:54,776 --> 00:43:57,036 A:middle
I don't want to spend
a whole time at it

971
00:43:57,036 --> 00:44:02,656 A:middle
because we did talk a lot about
Lightning last fall, of course.

972
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

973
00:44:02,896 --> 00:44:05,076 A:middle
But to briefly summarize,

974
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:08,016 A:middle
the Lightning connector
is all digital interface.

975
00:44:08,616 --> 00:44:12,246 A:middle
It is completely reversible
so that your users don't need

976
00:44:12,246 --> 00:44:14,916 A:middle
to worry about which way they're
plugging in your accessory.

977
00:44:15,866 --> 00:44:17,726 A:middle
And one interesting
thing about Lightning

978
00:44:17,726 --> 00:44:21,376 A:middle
that may not be very
obvious to most people,

979
00:44:21,376 --> 00:44:23,376 A:middle
but is actually felt every
single day when you plug

980
00:44:23,376 --> 00:44:24,196 A:middle
in your phone to charge it,

981
00:44:24,526 --> 00:44:27,456 A:middle
is that Lightning connectors
have a very positive insertion

982
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,176 A:middle
and removal feel.

983
00:44:28,746 --> 00:44:33,356 A:middle
There was no mistaking when
your user has connected their

984
00:44:33,356 --> 00:44:37,176 A:middle
accessory to a phone, and
likewise, there is no mistaking

985
00:44:37,176 --> 00:44:38,396 A:middle
when the user is disconnected.

986
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,846 A:middle
It sounds like a purely
mechanical [inaudible]

987
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:44,486 A:middle
but it actually is--
contributes greatly

988
00:44:44,486 --> 00:44:46,916 A:middle
to the overall user experience.

989
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:48,866 A:middle
Because if you have, I'm
sure that some of you

990
00:44:48,866 --> 00:44:50,406 A:middle
in the audience have
had experiences with--

991
00:44:50,786 --> 00:44:53,756 A:middle
dealing with connectors
that feel a little bit loose

992
00:44:53,756 --> 00:44:54,796 A:middle
or slipped out and the like,

993
00:44:54,996 --> 00:44:58,286 A:middle
and that can also sometimes
result in a poor experience.

994
00:44:58,986 --> 00:45:00,066 A:middle
You won't have that
with Lightning.

995
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

996
00:45:01,226 --> 00:45:02,866 A:middle
Lightning connectors
just stop by the end

997
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:03,856 A:middle
and they start working.

998
00:45:05,236 --> 00:45:06,946 A:middle
Another important
feature of Lighting

999
00:45:06,946 --> 00:45:10,216 A:middle
which maybe is not
necessarily immediately apparent

1000
00:45:10,216 --> 00:45:12,356 A:middle
to most people is that it
actually provides power

1001
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:13,306 A:middle
on both directions.

1002
00:45:14,496 --> 00:45:18,186 A:middle
Lightning based accessories do
not just have to provide power

1003
00:45:18,346 --> 00:45:22,876 A:middle
to the Apple devices although
of course we love getting power

1004
00:45:22,876 --> 00:45:24,156 A:middle
so please send us all you can.

1005
00:45:25,636 --> 00:45:28,466 A:middle
But it is also possible to draw
a power from Apple devices.

1006
00:45:28,836 --> 00:45:31,856 A:middle
Now, we do put some limitations
on that and some requirements

1007
00:45:31,856 --> 00:45:34,116 A:middle
because we don't want users

1008
00:45:34,116 --> 00:45:37,316 A:middle
to be wondering why they have
this vampire essentially sucking

1009
00:45:37,316 --> 00:45:38,186 A:middle
power out of their phone.

1010
00:45:38,666 --> 00:45:44,466 A:middle
But for the right categories
of accessories, getting power

1011
00:45:44,466 --> 00:45:46,456 A:middle
from an Apple device is
a very powerful feature.

1012
00:45:46,456 --> 00:45:48,846 A:middle
It means that your accessory
doesn't have to have a battery.

1013
00:45:48,936 --> 00:45:52,266 A:middle
It doesn't have to even have
a power supply at the box

1014
00:45:52,686 --> 00:45:55,126 A:middle
or even a connector for
external power supply.

1015
00:45:55,376 --> 00:45:57,736 A:middle
All you see on the accessory
is the Lightning connector.

1016
00:45:58,486 --> 00:45:59,716 A:middle
The Lightning connector
also has--

1017
00:45:59,716 --> 00:46:01,876 A:middle
is multifaceted in terms
of its data transmission.

1018
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1019
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:03,916 A:middle
That supports multiple types

1020
00:46:03,916 --> 00:46:08,336 A:middle
of connectivity technologies
starting with USB host,

1021
00:46:08,876 --> 00:46:10,786 A:middle
USB device, and Serial.

1022
00:46:12,276 --> 00:46:15,496 A:middle
Now, the availability of various
accessory interface features

1023
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:19,406 A:middle
over these transports does
vary based on the transport.

1024
00:46:19,406 --> 00:46:22,876 A:middle
So, we definitely do recommend
that your accessories make use

1025
00:46:22,976 --> 00:46:26,206 A:middle
of the USB host mode
on Apple devices.

1026
00:46:26,286 --> 00:46:27,956 A:middle
And by this, I mean
just be clear

1027
00:46:27,956 --> 00:46:31,646 A:middle
that the Apple device is
playing the role of the USB host

1028
00:46:31,936 --> 00:46:34,546 A:middle
and your accessory
is a USB device.

1029
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:36,426 A:middle
As you can see here
from the slide,

1030
00:46:36,816 --> 00:46:38,596 A:middle
there are more features
available today

1031
00:46:39,006 --> 00:46:40,406 A:middle
to USB host mode accessories

1032
00:46:40,406 --> 00:46:41,936 A:middle
than to USB device
mode accessories,

1033
00:46:42,856 --> 00:46:44,866 A:middle
and that is definitely
a trend that we expect

1034
00:46:44,866 --> 00:46:46,216 A:middle
to see continuing forward.

1035
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:49,476 A:middle
We have a left out
Serial though.

1036
00:46:50,146 --> 00:46:54,636 A:middle
Why? Well, Serial interfaces
are really, really simple

1037
00:46:54,636 --> 00:46:58,296 A:middle
to implement and they're very,
very low cost and they're very,

1038
00:46:58,296 --> 00:47:01,566 A:middle
very low power, kind
of going back to why--

1039
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1040
00:47:01,566 --> 00:47:03,566 A:middle
the question about drawing
power from Apple devices.

1041
00:47:03,706 --> 00:47:07,096 A:middle
It's something you
should definitely consider

1042
00:47:07,096 --> 00:47:10,176 A:middle
if your accessory design falls
into that kind of category.

1043
00:47:10,226 --> 00:47:12,956 A:middle
If your data transmission
rate is not too high

1044
00:47:14,076 --> 00:47:19,946 A:middle
and you're drawing power from
an Apple device, you may want

1045
00:47:19,946 --> 00:47:21,196 A:middle
to consider that interface.

1046
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:24,846 A:middle
I also want to talk briefly

1047
00:47:24,846 --> 00:47:27,426 A:middle
about the headphone
with remote and mic.

1048
00:47:28,236 --> 00:47:31,866 A:middle
One, the most obvious example of
course is the EarPods that comes

1049
00:47:31,866 --> 00:47:32,916 A:middle
in a box of every iPhone.

1050
00:47:35,026 --> 00:47:36,906 A:middle
Accessory headphones that
implement the headphone remote

1051
00:47:36,906 --> 00:47:38,396 A:middle
and mic feature all have

1052
00:47:38,396 --> 00:47:40,286 A:middle
to use a standardized
microphone and transmitter chip.

1053
00:47:40,326 --> 00:47:42,606 A:middle
And what this means
is that they all work

1054
00:47:42,606 --> 00:47:44,986 A:middle
with all iOS devices
and most Macs.

1055
00:47:45,576 --> 00:47:48,226 A:middle
Applications running
on iOS devices

1056
00:47:48,226 --> 00:47:50,516 A:middle
and on Macs can receive events
from the remote control.

1057
00:47:50,816 --> 00:47:52,616 A:middle
So it isn't just limited
to changing the volume

1058
00:47:52,616 --> 00:47:54,436 A:middle
and starting playback
or pausing playback.

1059
00:47:54,946 --> 00:47:59,676 A:middle
And last but not
least, I want to bring

1060
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:02,086 A:middle
up the game controller
feature one more time

1061
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1062
00:48:02,706 --> 00:48:05,466 A:middle
and I'm mentioning
specifically in the context

1063
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:06,776 A:middle
of Wired accessory interfaces

1064
00:48:06,776 --> 00:48:08,106 A:middle
because we're actually
very excited

1065
00:48:08,106 --> 00:48:13,426 A:middle
to consider what possibilities
await for both game developers

1066
00:48:13,596 --> 00:48:15,456 A:middle
and game controller
manufacturers

1067
00:48:15,746 --> 00:48:19,076 A:middle
when you consider the
power of tactile feedback

1068
00:48:19,126 --> 00:48:22,236 A:middle
from the game controller
buttons combined

1069
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:27,116 A:middle
with the multi-touch screen tilt
and driver sensors in an iPhone.

1070
00:48:29,436 --> 00:48:31,026 A:middle
We're really looking forward

1071
00:48:31,026 --> 00:48:34,046 A:middle
to see what creativity
arises from all this.

1072
00:48:34,956 --> 00:48:37,976 A:middle
And not only but the game
controller framework is going

1073
00:48:37,976 --> 00:48:41,206 A:middle
to be standardized so that if
you're making game controllers,

1074
00:48:41,416 --> 00:48:42,226 A:middle
you won't need to worry

1075
00:48:42,226 --> 00:48:44,976 A:middle
about which apps your game
controller is compatible

1076
00:48:44,976 --> 00:48:47,956 A:middle
with 'cause the answer
is all of them.

1077
00:48:47,956 --> 00:48:49,896 A:middle
And we need to go
check the compatibility

1078
00:48:49,896 --> 00:48:51,826 A:middle
with every single app out
there by trying that yourself.

1079
00:48:52,456 --> 00:48:54,956 A:middle
The inverse holds true
for the game developers.

1080
00:48:54,956 --> 00:48:57,976 A:middle
They won't need to have a
closet full of game controllers

1081
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,636 A:middle
that they keep testing
every single time.

1082
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1083
00:49:00,126 --> 00:49:01,666 A:middle
For those of you in the
audience who are thinking

1084
00:49:01,666 --> 00:49:02,966 A:middle
about getting involved
with this,

1085
00:49:02,966 --> 00:49:04,796 A:middle
with the controller
manufacturing inside of things,

1086
00:49:05,236 --> 00:49:08,646 A:middle
look for update to the
MFi accessory interface

1087
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:12,626 A:middle
specification coming soon.

1088
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:16,046 A:middle
So, for more information
about all the technologies

1089
00:49:16,046 --> 00:49:18,346 A:middle
that we talked about
today, definitely,

1090
00:49:18,346 --> 00:49:20,486 A:middle
feel free to contact
any of the three people,

1091
00:49:20,716 --> 00:49:23,666 A:middle
named on this slide in addition

1092
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:25,906 A:middle
to visiting the Apple
Developer Forums

1093
00:49:26,656 --> 00:49:28,776 A:middle
and contacting Apple
Developer Support.

1094
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:32,116 A:middle
There are a bunch of related
sessions that you may want

1095
00:49:32,116 --> 00:49:33,916 A:middle
to pay attention to as a result

1096
00:49:33,916 --> 00:49:35,526 A:middle
of having heard the
content mentioned here.

1097
00:49:36,456 --> 00:49:40,016 A:middle
And with that, that
concludes the session.

1098
00:49:40,326 --> 00:49:40,886 A:middle
Thanks for attending.

1099
00:49:40,951 --> 00:49:42,951 A:middle
