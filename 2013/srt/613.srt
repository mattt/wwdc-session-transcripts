00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:11,276 A:middle
>> Nathan de Vries:
Good afternoon everyone.

2
00:00:12,176 --> 00:00:14,866 A:middle
My name's Nathan de Vries
[phonetic] and today I'm going

3
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:18,036 A:middle
to be talking to you about iAd
Integration into your Apps.

4
00:00:18,726 --> 00:00:21,576 A:middle
Now there are two major
opportunities the iAd presents

5
00:00:21,576 --> 00:00:22,696 A:middle
to developers.

6
00:00:23,216 --> 00:00:25,556 A:middle
The first is promoting
your applications

7
00:00:25,596 --> 00:00:28,546 A:middle
with the new iAd
Workbench feature

8
00:00:28,546 --> 00:00:29,806 A:middle
that was announced this week.

9
00:00:30,326 --> 00:00:34,326 A:middle
And the second thing is
a revenue opportunity

10
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:35,296 A:middle
for your applications.

11
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:39,066 A:middle
So using application to generate
revenue through advertising,

12
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:41,216 A:middle
and that's what we're going
to be talking about today.

13
00:00:41,586 --> 00:00:44,106 A:middle
How to integrate iAds
into your applications

14
00:00:44,306 --> 00:00:45,396 A:middle
to generate revenue.

15
00:00:45,396 --> 00:00:49,016 A:middle
Now we're going to be doing
that by going through this flow.

16
00:00:49,246 --> 00:00:51,296 A:middle
We're going to start by talking

17
00:00:51,296 --> 00:00:53,946 A:middle
about the developer
benefits of iAd specifically.

18
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:56,686 A:middle
Why it might be a
good choice for you

19
00:00:56,686 --> 00:00:58,616 A:middle
to generate revenue
in your applications.

20
00:00:59,116 --> 00:01:01,536 A:middle
Then we're going to look at some
core concepts that are critical

21
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

22
00:01:01,536 --> 00:01:05,706 A:middle
in understanding why your
application is generating

23
00:01:05,706 --> 00:01:08,756 A:middle
revenue in the way it is, how
you can improve on that revenue

24
00:01:08,756 --> 00:01:10,916 A:middle
by making adjustments
to your application,

25
00:01:11,436 --> 00:01:12,266 A:middle
and we're also going to go

26
00:01:12,266 --> 00:01:14,996 A:middle
into a little bit more detail
beyond those core concepts

27
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:17,486 A:middle
and talk about specific
things that you can do

28
00:01:17,486 --> 00:01:19,686 A:middle
to optimize ad performance
in your applications.

29
00:01:20,286 --> 00:01:23,306 A:middle
Next we're going to briefly look
at how to join the iAd network.

30
00:01:23,306 --> 00:01:24,356 A:middle
It's very easy.

31
00:01:24,746 --> 00:01:28,006 A:middle
And lastly, which is the major
chunk of the presentation

32
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:30,846 A:middle
which you're all here
for, is to look at some

33
00:01:30,846 --> 00:01:34,526 A:middle
of the developer API's
for integrating iAds

34
00:01:34,526 --> 00:01:35,536 A:middle
into your application.

35
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:38,966 A:middle
So let's start with
the developer benefits.

36
00:01:39,796 --> 00:01:43,496 A:middle
First and foremost,
ignoring ads all together,

37
00:01:43,596 --> 00:01:46,396 A:middle
you put huge amount of effort
into your applications,

38
00:01:46,396 --> 00:01:49,636 A:middle
which they mix with applications
that have won the design awards,

39
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:53,046 A:middle
blood, sweat and tears get
poured into your applications.

40
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:56,026 A:middle
So you really want experiences
within your application

41
00:01:56,276 --> 00:01:58,386 A:middle
that match the amount of
effort that you put in.

42
00:01:58,816 --> 00:02:02,196 A:middle
So first and foremost, we really
want to delight your customers.

43
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

44
00:02:02,776 --> 00:02:05,776 A:middle
So that's why the advertisements

45
00:02:05,776 --> 00:02:08,996 A:middle
with iAd have very
high production values.

46
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,926 A:middle
We put a lot of attention
to detail into the ads

47
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:16,436 A:middle
so that your users get the same
beautiful enriched experiences

48
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,266 A:middle
that they expect from your app.

49
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:24,106 A:middle
As part of this rich experience,
iAd support media, playback,

50
00:02:24,106 --> 00:02:27,726 A:middle
and game-type experiences,
really adding

51
00:02:27,726 --> 00:02:30,836 A:middle
to the features of
your application.

52
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:35,206 A:middle
Like your application that
has access to amazing API's

53
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:38,976 A:middle
on the platform like Gyroscope
and Cameran and so on,

54
00:02:39,256 --> 00:02:41,906 A:middle
ads also have access
to these API's.

55
00:02:41,906 --> 00:02:45,336 A:middle
The ads are seamlessly
integrated with iOS' software

56
00:02:45,336 --> 00:02:48,906 A:middle
and as hardware, so there's
not this sandboxed limited

57
00:02:48,906 --> 00:02:50,346 A:middle
experience inside an ad.

58
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,186 A:middle
It's just an app.

59
00:02:53,446 --> 00:02:54,426 A:middle
And this creates this kind

60
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:56,696 A:middle
of immersive experience
for the user.

61
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,606 A:middle
If they choose to
engage with an ad,

62
00:02:59,016 --> 00:03:01,266 A:middle
it feels like this amazing
experience for them.

63
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

64
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:02,936 A:middle
And that's what we're
really trying to achieve.

65
00:03:03,486 --> 00:03:06,686 A:middle
And you can see here the
types of examples of ads

66
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,346 A:middle
where you can really shake
the app and it interacts

67
00:03:09,346 --> 00:03:11,196 A:middle
with the ad, or you
can play music

68
00:03:11,196 --> 00:03:13,206 A:middle
or a game, watch move trailers.

69
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,616 A:middle
These are all the
kinds of things

70
00:03:14,616 --> 00:03:16,576 A:middle
that advertisers are
providing in their ads.

71
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:21,416 A:middle
And lastly, even though when the
user engages in an ad and their

72
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,166 A:middle
in this [inaudible] experience,
their still in your app.

73
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:27,106 A:middle
So as soon as I dismiss
the ad, they're right back

74
00:03:27,176 --> 00:03:28,946 A:middle
in your app where they left off.

75
00:03:28,946 --> 00:03:31,296 A:middle
Just seamlessly in and
straight out again.

76
00:03:31,886 --> 00:03:38,236 A:middle
So because the ad is inside
your app, we value the privacy

77
00:03:38,236 --> 00:03:40,556 A:middle
of the users of your
application.

78
00:03:40,556 --> 00:03:43,326 A:middle
This is why we request
permission before asking

79
00:03:43,326 --> 00:03:47,586 A:middle
for contact access in your
application, or photo access,

80
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:49,306 A:middle
because we really
value the privacy

81
00:03:49,306 --> 00:03:51,576 A:middle
of the users of your
application.

82
00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:54,456 A:middle
Likewise, with advertising,
we also have

83
00:03:54,456 --> 00:03:57,316 A:middle
that same approach to privacy.

84
00:03:57,316 --> 00:04:00,266 A:middle
So we handle the privacy, so you
don't need to worry about it.

85
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

86
00:04:00,676 --> 00:04:01,816 A:middle
Users start using ads

87
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:05,476 A:middle
within your application have
the same privacy thought

88
00:04:05,476 --> 00:04:07,706 A:middle
about that we do for your app.

89
00:04:09,576 --> 00:04:11,886 A:middle
The world's best
brands are using iAd.

90
00:04:12,116 --> 00:04:16,786 A:middle
So all around the world we have
agencies working with brands,

91
00:04:16,786 --> 00:04:19,156 A:middle
winning design awards
for advertising,

92
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,906 A:middle
using the iAd platform.

93
00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:25,496 A:middle
So all creating is, these brands
are very familiar to your users,

94
00:04:25,496 --> 00:04:28,116 A:middle
so their much more likely to
engage in the advertising,

95
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:32,796 A:middle
and that really drives
the immersive experience

96
00:04:32,796 --> 00:04:33,566 A:middle
for the users.

97
00:04:35,046 --> 00:04:38,196 A:middle
Every year we're
expanding so far.

98
00:04:38,286 --> 00:04:41,476 A:middle
We started in the U.S. We've
recently rolled out into Mexico.

99
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:43,466 A:middle
There's 11 countries
now that we support.

100
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:48,706 A:middle
So there's a great opportunity,
not just to advertise locally,

101
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:50,386 A:middle
but also broadly,
and we'll speak

102
00:04:50,386 --> 00:04:54,076 A:middle
about that a little bit later.

103
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:56,846 A:middle
It's also a menu
here to work out how

104
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:58,456 A:middle
to monetize your application.

105
00:04:58,636 --> 00:05:00,076 A:middle
It's a great path to revenue.

106
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

107
00:05:00,656 --> 00:05:02,836 A:middle
When your application
displays an advertisement,

108
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,536 A:middle
the advertising revenue that's
generated from the display,

109
00:05:06,536 --> 00:05:10,266 A:middle
and the interaction with those
ads, 70% of that revenue goes

110
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:11,566 A:middle
to you as a developer.

111
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:14,516 A:middle
So we think that's a really
great way for you to make money

112
00:05:14,516 --> 00:05:15,546 A:middle
with your applications.

113
00:05:16,706 --> 00:05:20,356 A:middle
And lastly, as developers, it's
incredibly easy to implement.

114
00:05:20,706 --> 00:05:22,426 A:middle
You'll be able to jump to
that later on when we go

115
00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:25,496 A:middle
into the developer
details, but we really feel

116
00:05:25,536 --> 00:05:27,886 A:middle
like we've made it as
easy as possible for you

117
00:05:27,886 --> 00:05:29,526 A:middle
to integrate ads into
your application.

118
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:33,846 A:middle
There's no need to link
against additional SDK's,

119
00:05:33,846 --> 00:05:37,536 A:middle
so no need to maintain
and download other SDK's.

120
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:42,556 A:middle
You can be up and running in
really small amount of code.

121
00:05:42,556 --> 00:05:44,816 A:middle
We also have some great sample
code which you'll notice

122
00:05:44,816 --> 00:05:47,896 A:middle
on the developer@apple.com
website, which I'll link

123
00:05:47,896 --> 00:05:48,846 A:middle
to a little bit later.

124
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:52,636 A:middle
This provides the iAd
Suite sample code,

125
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:54,346 A:middle
as well as developer
documentation.

126
00:05:54,576 --> 00:05:57,396 A:middle
If you were to really dive
in and see examples of how

127
00:05:57,396 --> 00:05:59,276 A:middle
to integrate ads into
your application.

128
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

129
00:06:00,036 --> 00:06:03,146 A:middle
And lastly, we think that's
always been pretty easy

130
00:06:03,146 --> 00:06:05,686 A:middle
to integrate ads, but we've
made it even easier this year

131
00:06:05,686 --> 00:06:06,806 A:middle
with iOS 7.

132
00:06:06,806 --> 00:06:08,796 A:middle
So we're looking
forward to your feedback

133
00:06:08,796 --> 00:06:09,796 A:middle
on some of the new stuff.

134
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,836 A:middle
Next let's have a look
at some core concepts.

135
00:06:14,556 --> 00:06:16,746 A:middle
Integrating iAds
into your application

136
00:06:16,746 --> 00:06:18,946 A:middle
from a developer point of
view is incredibly easy.

137
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,386 A:middle
You'll get up and
running very quickly.

138
00:06:21,896 --> 00:06:25,396 A:middle
But there are some core
concepts related to advertising

139
00:06:25,396 --> 00:06:28,316 A:middle
and iAds specifically that
are useful to have in the back

140
00:06:28,316 --> 00:06:30,266 A:middle
of your mind when you're
integrating the ads

141
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:32,176 A:middle
because once you've
shipped your application,

142
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:34,276 A:middle
it's in the app store, and
customers are using your app,

143
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,466 A:middle
you're going to need
to track the progress

144
00:06:36,466 --> 00:06:38,866 A:middle
of revenue generated
by your app.

145
00:06:39,386 --> 00:06:41,816 A:middle
So some of these core concepts
are going to keep coming

146
00:06:41,816 --> 00:06:45,406 A:middle
up in your sales reports and
changes that you need to make

147
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:46,896 A:middle
to your application
to improve some

148
00:06:46,896 --> 00:06:48,956 A:middle
of the ad performance,
so we'll start there.

149
00:06:49,996 --> 00:06:53,146 A:middle
First of all, what is
the iAd App Network?

150
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:56,066 A:middle
Well we mentioned briefly
that there's the two things

151
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:58,456 A:middle
that that the iAd network
really provides to developers;

152
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:00,936 A:middle
the path to revenue, which
we're talking about today,

153
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

154
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:04,276 A:middle
and also the promotional
aspect promoting your app.

155
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:09,426 A:middle
So the iAd App Network is the
Apple business team working

156
00:07:09,426 --> 00:07:12,796 A:middle
with advertisers to produce
inventory and delivering them

157
00:07:12,796 --> 00:07:15,126 A:middle
to you, the developer
that's integrating iAds.

158
00:07:16,176 --> 00:07:17,986 A:middle
So what does this look like?

159
00:07:18,216 --> 00:07:22,626 A:middle
You've linked your application
against the iAd framework.

160
00:07:23,296 --> 00:07:26,416 A:middle
What this means is that
the iAd framework is going

161
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,806 A:middle
to send requests to
the iAd App Network

162
00:07:28,806 --> 00:07:31,126 A:middle
on your behalf asking ads.

163
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:35,326 A:middle
So we send ad requests to the
App Network, which replies,

164
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:37,426 A:middle
as you'd expect, with ads.

165
00:07:37,936 --> 00:07:42,286 A:middle
So this combination of two
things: The requests being sent

166
00:07:42,286 --> 00:07:46,186 A:middle
to the network and the ads being
sent back form this concept

167
00:07:46,186 --> 00:07:46,986 A:middle
called the Fill Rate.

168
00:07:47,086 --> 00:07:48,136 A:middle
Those of you that are familiar

169
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:50,826 A:middle
with advertising probably
have heard of this before,

170
00:07:51,176 --> 00:07:54,866 A:middle
but this is the measure of
performance of requests sent

171
00:07:54,866 --> 00:07:57,466 A:middle
by all of your applications,
versus the ads

172
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:59,546 A:middle
that are delivered
by the network.

173
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,076 A:middle
And we'll come back to
that when we're talking

174
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

175
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:03,346 A:middle
about improving app performance.

176
00:08:04,946 --> 00:08:08,286 A:middle
Once you've been delivered an
ad, you still have to display it

177
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:10,406 A:middle
on the screen, so just
getting an ad isn't enough,

178
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,496 A:middle
you have to show it to the user.

179
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:13,186 A:middle
That's the point of this.

180
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:15,296 A:middle
So that's called an impression.

181
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:17,636 A:middle
As soon as you display
an ad to a user,

182
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:21,476 A:middle
it's called an impression,
and a certain percentage

183
00:08:21,476 --> 00:08:24,496 A:middle
of those impressions will
hopefully turn into Tap Throughs

184
00:08:24,496 --> 00:08:26,036 A:middle
when the user engages
with the ad.

185
00:08:26,676 --> 00:08:30,286 A:middle
And these two concepts combined
are called the Tap Through rate.

186
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:33,986 A:middle
So the number of Tap Throughs,
versus the number of impressions

187
00:08:33,986 --> 00:08:35,226 A:middle
that you're shown in your app.

188
00:08:35,226 --> 00:08:38,756 A:middle
And you'll see these
as well in your reports

189
00:08:38,756 --> 00:08:41,466 A:middle
when you're measuring the
performance of your app.

190
00:08:42,336 --> 00:08:44,056 A:middle
So that's a few of
the core concepts.

191
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,846 A:middle
We'll refer back to them
later on in the presentation.

192
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:49,986 A:middle
Next let's look at some
tangible things that you can do

193
00:08:50,336 --> 00:08:52,136 A:middle
to improve the ad performance

194
00:08:52,136 --> 00:08:54,966 A:middle
of your application before you
even get started with the code.

195
00:08:58,046 --> 00:09:03,316 A:middle
So first and foremost, it
all starts with a great app.

196
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

197
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,786 A:middle
You need to focus
on the customer.

198
00:09:05,766 --> 00:09:08,516 A:middle
Your app needs to have
utility and be useful,

199
00:09:08,626 --> 00:09:12,216 A:middle
so ignoring the advertising side
of things, your app just has

200
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:14,586 A:middle
to be something that you
want lots of people to use.

201
00:09:14,936 --> 00:09:16,206 A:middle
They find it really useful.

202
00:09:16,476 --> 00:09:17,676 A:middle
They come back to it.

203
00:09:18,136 --> 00:09:20,116 A:middle
There's loyalty associated
with your app.

204
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:22,066 A:middle
People just really have
to want to use our app.

205
00:09:22,386 --> 00:09:24,606 A:middle
I'm recommending going
to some of the sessions

206
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:28,336 A:middle
on design during the conference,
or watching them on the videos,

207
00:09:28,656 --> 00:09:30,266 A:middle
because honing is
part of your app.

208
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:31,826 A:middle
It is going to be a
key to the success

209
00:09:31,826 --> 00:09:33,746 A:middle
of advertising in your app.

210
00:09:34,726 --> 00:09:36,946 A:middle
Having a great app, or
something that's worth talking

211
00:09:36,946 --> 00:09:38,826 A:middle
about will generate
network effects.

212
00:09:38,866 --> 00:09:40,836 A:middle
So you'll start getting
reviews on the app store,

213
00:09:40,836 --> 00:09:42,086 A:middle
people will talk about your app,

214
00:09:42,586 --> 00:09:45,676 A:middle
and all of these things
result in more ad requests.

215
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:49,816 A:middle
So as a side effect of focusing
on the customer and your app,

216
00:09:50,396 --> 00:09:52,876 A:middle
you're immediately going
to get more ad requests,

217
00:09:53,286 --> 00:09:57,266 A:middle
more ads served, which
is better for your app.

218
00:09:58,336 --> 00:10:02,076 A:middle
The next thing that you can
do is to place ads smartly.

219
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

220
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,666 A:middle
Key here is not place
ads everywhere.

221
00:10:04,846 --> 00:10:08,116 A:middle
You have to really
consider user context,

222
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:12,036 A:middle
as well as recognizing high
use areas in your application,

223
00:10:12,136 --> 00:10:14,646 A:middle
so when you're looking
at a holistic view

224
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:15,576 A:middle
of your application,

225
00:10:15,576 --> 00:10:17,986 A:middle
really consider is
this view appropriate

226
00:10:17,986 --> 00:10:20,626 A:middle
to advertising how
many users are entering

227
00:10:20,626 --> 00:10:22,866 A:middle
into this part of my app.

228
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,296 A:middle
You want to avoid
accidental taps.

229
00:10:25,536 --> 00:10:27,656 A:middle
So placing ads in spots

230
00:10:27,656 --> 00:10:31,856 A:middle
where users might accidently
tap the ad isn't a good thing

231
00:10:31,856 --> 00:10:33,186 A:middle
because it might
be an impression,

232
00:10:33,186 --> 00:10:35,976 A:middle
but if people are tapping on the
ad and immediately dismissing it

233
00:10:35,976 --> 00:10:37,066 A:middle
because it was a mistake?

234
00:10:37,446 --> 00:10:39,686 A:middle
That's not going to be very
good for your ad performance.

235
00:10:41,036 --> 00:10:43,116 A:middle
And really keep in
the back of your mind

236
00:10:43,116 --> 00:10:45,466 A:middle
when you're designing your
apps and integration of ads

237
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:48,786 A:middle
into your apps, that user
context is incredibly important.

238
00:10:49,196 --> 00:10:52,626 A:middle
So you really need to weigh up
the benefit of an impression

239
00:10:52,956 --> 00:10:55,226 A:middle
versus what the user
was trying to do

240
00:10:55,226 --> 00:10:56,486 A:middle
when you were showing that ad.

241
00:10:56,696 --> 00:10:59,576 A:middle
So things like showing
advertisements

242
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,616 A:middle
during registration.

243
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

244
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:02,246 A:middle
Maybe you want to
show advertisements

245
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:04,306 A:middle
after registration
because the success

246
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:07,056 A:middle
of your app is predicated
on someone signing up,

247
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,346 A:middle
enjoying the app, and
coming back to the app,

248
00:11:09,726 --> 00:11:12,406 A:middle
which will produce more
advertising revenue for you.

249
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:15,496 A:middle
You should also consider
customer location.

250
00:11:16,036 --> 00:11:19,346 A:middle
I mentioned that we support
11 different countries

251
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:19,916 A:middle
at the moment.

252
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:22,666 A:middle
So you should take
this into account

253
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,526 A:middle
when you're planning
your marketing strategy.

254
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:28,826 A:middle
If you're only serving your
app to, say, the states,

255
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:31,706 A:middle
then maybe you should consider
serving to other regions

256
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:35,516 A:middle
because these regions will
also be sending ad requests,

257
00:11:35,786 --> 00:11:37,326 A:middle
but not getting anything back.

258
00:11:37,326 --> 00:11:39,676 A:middle
Or they might not even have
the app available in the store.

259
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:41,946 A:middle
So really consider where
you're submitting your app,

260
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:43,636 A:middle
to which stores, and take

261
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,326 A:middle
into account these iAd
App Network countries.

262
00:11:47,546 --> 00:11:48,496 A:middle
One thing that you can do

263
00:11:48,496 --> 00:11:51,456 A:middle
with this is target your
marketing to those countries.

264
00:11:51,746 --> 00:11:54,376 A:middle
So if you've never thought
about advertising specifically

265
00:11:54,376 --> 00:11:57,126 A:middle
to a particular country, maybe
you should try doing that?

266
00:11:57,126 --> 00:11:59,556 A:middle
That will increase the number
of customers in that country,

267
00:11:59,776 --> 00:12:01,756 A:middle
and really drive up
those ad requests,

268
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

269
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:04,456 A:middle
and assist with optimizing
the ad performance

270
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:05,366 A:middle
of your application.

271
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,096 A:middle
You could even consider
going a step further

272
00:12:08,096 --> 00:12:10,446 A:middle
and localizing your
applications.

273
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:12,446 A:middle
The last country that we rolled

274
00:12:12,446 --> 00:12:15,476 A:middle
out the iAd App Network
to was Mexico.

275
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:19,106 A:middle
It's right next door and
you could localize our app

276
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:22,676 A:middle
in Spanish, and immediately
get access to a whole bunch

277
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:25,296 A:middle
of customers that you would
never have had access to before.

278
00:12:25,736 --> 00:12:29,016 A:middle
Driving up ad requests,
impressions, Tap Throughs,

279
00:12:29,336 --> 00:12:31,186 A:middle
and improving your
app performance.

280
00:12:33,406 --> 00:12:34,386 A:middle
Another thing that you need

281
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:38,006 A:middle
to consider is the
seasonality of advertising.

282
00:12:38,516 --> 00:12:40,816 A:middle
Consumer spending throughout
the year fluctuates,

283
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:44,776 A:middle
so as does advertising spending.

284
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:48,176 A:middle
Advertising spending kind of
tracks consumer spending, right?

285
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:50,866 A:middle
So you should also
market accordingly.

286
00:12:51,056 --> 00:12:53,646 A:middle
If you know that there's going
to be a holiday period coming

287
00:12:53,646 --> 00:12:55,716 A:middle
up where spending is
going to be increased,

288
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:58,266 A:middle
maybe you should focus
your marketing attention

289
00:12:58,456 --> 00:12:59,706 A:middle
to that time of the year.

290
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:01,466 A:middle
Increase a little bit of
your marketing budget,

291
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

292
00:13:02,086 --> 00:13:05,346 A:middle
get some more customers into
your apps at that point in time,

293
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:10,846 A:middle
and then you'll get more
requests at that time.

294
00:13:10,886 --> 00:13:13,546 A:middle
And, I guess the one
thing to take away

295
00:13:13,546 --> 00:13:16,516 A:middle
from this is it's a very,
it's a feedback loop.

296
00:13:17,656 --> 00:13:20,416 A:middle
As you drive more customers
to your app, you're going

297
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:23,546 A:middle
to get more ad requests, which
are going to result in more ads,

298
00:13:24,246 --> 00:13:26,986 A:middle
which in turn turns into
impressions, and Tap Throughs,

299
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:29,716 A:middle
and the iAd App Network
will use all of these things

300
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:32,386 A:middle
to decide should I send
more ads to this app?

301
00:13:32,776 --> 00:13:34,416 A:middle
How many ads should
I send to this app?

302
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:38,486 A:middle
So a really healthy
app is one that works

303
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:41,776 A:middle
with this feedback loop that
really drives as many customers

304
00:13:41,776 --> 00:13:45,636 A:middle
as possible, creates
loyalty, and gets more ads.

305
00:13:46,276 --> 00:13:49,676 A:middle
So that's a little bit about
optimizing ad performance.

306
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:53,316 A:middle
You might be wondering, well how
do I join the iAd App Network?

307
00:13:53,936 --> 00:13:55,906 A:middle
It's pretty easy.

308
00:13:56,556 --> 00:13:59,766 A:middle
If you've submitted an app
before, you would have gone

309
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:01,396 A:middle
to the iTunes Connect website,

310
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

311
00:14:01,396 --> 00:14:05,936 A:middle
so the iAd preferences
configured in the same place.

312
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:09,526 A:middle
All you need to do is
complete the iAd contract once.

313
00:14:09,526 --> 00:14:11,596 A:middle
And then on a per app basis,

314
00:14:11,596 --> 00:14:15,416 A:middle
you need to enable iAd
specifically for that app.

315
00:14:15,716 --> 00:14:17,276 A:middle
One thing to bear in
mind is that you need

316
00:14:17,276 --> 00:14:18,996 A:middle
to do this before
you submit your app.

317
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,526 A:middle
So before you've finished
developing your app

318
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:25,466 A:middle
and maybe you want to
create the descriptions

319
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:28,836 A:middle
and the screenshots, and so
on, the App Store details

320
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:32,126 A:middle
for your app, make sure you
enable iAd before you submit the

321
00:14:32,126 --> 00:14:33,516 A:middle
binary for our application.

322
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:39,266 A:middle
So that's a little bit about
joining the iAd App Network.

323
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:41,626 A:middle
Let's dig in to some of
the developer details

324
00:14:41,626 --> 00:14:45,136 A:middle
about integrating apps
into your application.

325
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,626 A:middle
And to start with,
what we're going

326
00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:50,856 A:middle
to do is talk about banners.

327
00:14:51,806 --> 00:14:55,616 A:middle
The banner ad is a
slim device with view.

328
00:14:56,046 --> 00:14:57,726 A:middle
Sits at the bottom
of your content view.

329
00:14:58,676 --> 00:14:59,836 A:middle
And you can see one here.

330
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

331
00:15:00,986 --> 00:15:03,386 A:middle
It's typically a place at
the bottom of your content,

332
00:15:03,386 --> 00:15:06,886 A:middle
but remember back to the smart
placement bit of the talk

333
00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:10,476 A:middle
where you can adjust this
depending on music context

334
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:14,026 A:middle
to avoid accidental
taps, but our guidance is

335
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:16,286 A:middle
that it generally goes to
the bottom of the content.

336
00:15:16,796 --> 00:15:21,976 A:middle
As new ads become available,
the banner continuously loads,

337
00:15:22,056 --> 00:15:26,146 A:middle
so if your user passes out of
network access and comes back

338
00:15:26,146 --> 00:15:29,536 A:middle
into network access, these
banners will automatically bring

339
00:15:29,536 --> 00:15:32,256 A:middle
in new ads, and roll on and
off the screen automatically.

340
00:15:32,256 --> 00:15:35,526 A:middle
When you tap one
of these banners,

341
00:15:35,526 --> 00:15:37,966 A:middle
you get a full screen
immersive ad experience.

342
00:15:38,456 --> 00:15:41,716 A:middle
And lastly these
banner ads are supported

343
00:15:41,716 --> 00:15:43,386 A:middle
on both iPhone and iPad.

344
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,696 A:middle
So you can use them
in both contexts.

345
00:15:46,536 --> 00:15:49,446 A:middle
To integrate these banners,
there's three easy steps.

346
00:15:49,736 --> 00:15:53,826 A:middle
First you need to link the iAd
framework, which is pretty easy.

347
00:15:53,826 --> 00:15:55,586 A:middle
We're going to get a
demonstration of that soon.

348
00:15:56,486 --> 00:15:58,936 A:middle
You need to import the iAd
header from the framework.

349
00:15:59,906 --> 00:16:02,916 A:middle
And lastly, you need to
choose the view controllers

350
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

351
00:16:02,956 --> 00:16:07,106 A:middle
in your application that are
appropriate for advertising.

352
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:11,476 A:middle
So what I mentioned
before, that you had an app

353
00:16:11,476 --> 00:16:12,906 A:middle
with the banner view
across the bottom,

354
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,196 A:middle
you should consider each
screen of your application

355
00:16:16,646 --> 00:16:21,016 A:middle
as being appropriate or
inappropriate to the banner ads.

356
00:16:21,316 --> 00:16:23,966 A:middle
And we've got this new API
and iOS 7 that allows you

357
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:26,746 A:middle
to set a flag on any of your
View Controllers to say,

358
00:16:26,746 --> 00:16:28,606 A:middle
I would like banner
ads to be displayed

359
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:30,046 A:middle
in this View Controller.

360
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:34,946 A:middle
So we set the canDislayBannerAds
property to yes.

361
00:16:35,446 --> 00:16:39,096 A:middle
And what this does is
it takes the root view,

362
00:16:39,336 --> 00:16:42,886 A:middle
or the top level view
of your View Controller,

363
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:45,866 A:middle
and it becomes the
originalContentView.

364
00:16:46,026 --> 00:16:47,306 A:middle
It becomes a mute property.

365
00:16:48,366 --> 00:16:52,176 A:middle
This allows us to wrap
your View Controller's view

366
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:56,056 A:middle
in a Framework View which
allows us to animate the banner

367
00:16:56,206 --> 00:16:57,216 A:middle
on and off the screen.

368
00:16:58,136 --> 00:17:01,536 A:middle
So when you sent the
canDisplayBannerAds property

369
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

370
00:17:01,536 --> 00:17:04,935 A:middle
to yes, we wrap your
view in another view.

371
00:17:05,806 --> 00:17:09,136 A:middle
We start sending ad requests
to the network saying we would

372
00:17:09,136 --> 00:17:12,596 A:middle
like banner ads for
this particular device.

373
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:16,906 A:middle
When the banner loads, so we
get an ad back from the network,

374
00:17:17,776 --> 00:17:20,396 A:middle
the banner moves on
screen, adjusting the size

375
00:17:20,396 --> 00:17:21,886 A:middle
of your original content view.

376
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:24,665 A:middle
So the one thing you
need to keep in mind is

377
00:17:24,665 --> 00:17:28,006 A:middle
if you're referring to that
original view, you now need

378
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,646 A:middle
to change all of your calls to
view on your View Controller

379
00:17:30,646 --> 00:17:32,096 A:middle
to originalContentView.

380
00:17:32,546 --> 00:17:33,696 A:middle
And you also need to make sure

381
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:37,076 A:middle
that your originalContentView
respects Relay Out,

382
00:17:37,626 --> 00:17:39,826 A:middle
accommodating a new banner ad.

383
00:17:41,306 --> 00:17:42,976 A:middle
Once the banner is
on the screen,

384
00:17:43,156 --> 00:17:46,166 A:middle
the user has an opportunity
to tap on it.

385
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,096 A:middle
So we get that full screen
ad experience on tap.

386
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,526 A:middle
When the ad appears
on the screen,

387
00:17:51,526 --> 00:17:54,466 A:middle
you get the usual appearance
and disappearance callbacks

388
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:55,456 A:middle
on your View Controller.

389
00:17:55,986 --> 00:17:57,456 A:middle
So what you should do

390
00:17:57,546 --> 00:18:01,186 A:middle
in the viewWillDisappear
callback is poise

391
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

392
00:18:01,186 --> 00:18:05,016 A:middle
and intensive media
activities, sounds, and so on,

393
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,166 A:middle
that would interrupt
with the ad experience.

394
00:18:07,306 --> 00:18:10,766 A:middle
Because your goal is to have the
user enjoy the ad experience,

395
00:18:10,766 --> 00:18:14,176 A:middle
and not feel like the
app is using up CPU,

396
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,156 A:middle
slowing things down, because
that disrupts the ad experience.

397
00:18:18,126 --> 00:18:22,136 A:middle
When the full screen
advertisement is dismissed,

398
00:18:22,746 --> 00:18:26,176 A:middle
then this is a good time to
resume any immediate activity

399
00:18:26,486 --> 00:18:28,526 A:middle
that you had running
in your app.

400
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:31,036 A:middle
So now we've got
an ad on screen.

401
00:18:31,036 --> 00:18:34,326 A:middle
The user passes out of
network connectivity,

402
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,846 A:middle
or there's no longer
ad Inventory available

403
00:18:36,846 --> 00:18:39,566 A:middle
to your app, the ad unloads.

404
00:18:40,236 --> 00:18:41,426 A:middle
So when the ad unloads,

405
00:18:41,426 --> 00:18:44,646 A:middle
the banner is moved off-screen
automatically by the framework,

406
00:18:45,226 --> 00:18:48,456 A:middle
and your original content view
is resized much in the same way

407
00:18:48,456 --> 00:18:53,586 A:middle
as it was resized when it
was bought on the screen.

408
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:54,976 A:middle
So you've got these
View Controllers

409
00:18:54,976 --> 00:18:57,296 A:middle
and they're all configured,
or some of them are configured

410
00:18:57,296 --> 00:18:58,876 A:middle
with canDislayBannerAds.

411
00:18:59,116 --> 00:19:00,426 A:middle
There are certain circumstances

412
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

413
00:19:00,426 --> 00:19:03,236 A:middle
where you want a
temporarily disable banner ads

414
00:19:03,236 --> 00:19:05,836 A:middle
on a particular View Controller.

415
00:19:06,096 --> 00:19:07,406 A:middle
So we support that as well.

416
00:19:08,496 --> 00:19:11,046 A:middle
You simply need to set
the property back to No.

417
00:19:11,706 --> 00:19:14,136 A:middle
And when you're finished
with the app context,

418
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:17,696 A:middle
where it's inappropriate for
a banner ad to be displayed,

419
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:22,256 A:middle
or not ideal for a banner ad to
be displayed, then you can set

420
00:19:22,256 --> 00:19:23,936 A:middle
that property back to Yes.

421
00:19:24,426 --> 00:19:26,496 A:middle
Don't forget to re-enable.

422
00:19:26,836 --> 00:19:33,726 A:middle
Yes. We provide some great tools
for testing during development.

423
00:19:33,726 --> 00:19:36,406 A:middle
In the Developer Settings
pane on the device,

424
00:19:36,806 --> 00:19:39,326 A:middle
we have these two
great facilities

425
00:19:39,686 --> 00:19:41,046 A:middle
for adjusting the Fill Rate,

426
00:19:41,336 --> 00:19:43,156 A:middle
which we mentioned
in the core concepts.

427
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,716 A:middle
This allows you to
configure your application

428
00:19:46,716 --> 00:19:48,256 A:middle
so that it never gets ads.

429
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:51,066 A:middle
It always gets ads or
some variation in between.

430
00:19:51,366 --> 00:19:54,516 A:middle
This is as this was with
testing of your app.

431
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:57,076 A:middle
You can also adjust
the Refresh Rate.

432
00:19:57,526 --> 00:20:01,136 A:middle
So this is how quickly ads cycle
in and out of your application.

433
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

434
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:03,526 A:middle
One thing to bear in mind is

435
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:05,536 A:middle
that this only affects
your apps.

436
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:08,226 A:middle
So if you're carrying
a development device

437
00:20:08,226 --> 00:20:11,166 A:middle
and you total these Fill Rate
and Refresh Rate settings,

438
00:20:11,806 --> 00:20:15,266 A:middle
and then you run another
person's app from the store

439
00:20:15,266 --> 00:20:17,896 A:middle
that has iAds, it's not
going to affect the Fill Rate

440
00:20:17,896 --> 00:20:19,276 A:middle
and Refresh Rate of that app.

441
00:20:19,276 --> 00:20:23,156 A:middle
It's only apps that are
installed by you as a developer.

442
00:20:23,676 --> 00:20:27,916 A:middle
I'd like to bring
up David Wilson

443
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,596 A:middle
to give us a demonstration
of how

444
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,346 A:middle
to integrate banner ads
into our application.

445
00:20:31,826 --> 00:20:33,846 A:middle
>> David Wilson: So now that
we've talked about banner ads,

446
00:20:33,986 --> 00:20:36,696 A:middle
we're going to take a quick look
at a demo, just how easy it is

447
00:20:36,696 --> 00:20:38,326 A:middle
to take an existing application

448
00:20:38,606 --> 00:20:40,086 A:middle
and add this functionality
to it.

449
00:20:40,586 --> 00:20:42,746 A:middle
To do that, we're going to start
off with a simple application.

450
00:20:42,746 --> 00:20:44,136 A:middle
It's just two View Controllers.

451
00:20:44,136 --> 00:20:45,926 A:middle
It's a master detail.

452
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:48,456 A:middle
The first one's going to show
a list of article headlines,

453
00:20:48,756 --> 00:20:50,976 A:middle
and when you tap on one of those
article headlines, you're going

454
00:20:50,976 --> 00:20:53,296 A:middle
to go into New View
Controller that shows

455
00:20:53,296 --> 00:20:54,706 A:middle
that article in a web view.

456
00:20:54,706 --> 00:20:58,176 A:middle
What we want to do in the
first part of this demo is

457
00:20:58,176 --> 00:21:02,516 A:middle
to add a banner view to the
bottom of the list of articles.

458
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

459
00:21:02,956 --> 00:21:07,396 A:middle
So I'm going to go ahead and
pop open the iOS Simulator here,

460
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:10,456 A:middle
and this is the application
before we started doing anything

461
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:10,806 A:middle
to it.

462
00:21:11,256 --> 00:21:14,596 A:middle
We've got top news here,
a list of quick articles.

463
00:21:14,596 --> 00:21:17,316 A:middle
We can click on one of these and
we've got ourselves an article.

464
00:21:17,446 --> 00:21:19,276 A:middle
So let's see what we need to do

465
00:21:19,276 --> 00:21:21,746 A:middle
to add iAd Support
to this application.

466
00:21:22,206 --> 00:21:23,986 A:middle
We're going to hide
this, go back,

467
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:26,206 A:middle
to Xcode to bring
up our project.

468
00:21:26,206 --> 00:21:28,486 A:middle
And the first thing that
we need to do is link

469
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:29,736 A:middle
against the iAd framework.

470
00:21:29,736 --> 00:21:32,066 A:middle
So we're going to make sure
we've got our project selected.

471
00:21:32,456 --> 00:21:34,036 A:middle
Select the appropriate
target here.

472
00:21:34,076 --> 00:21:35,676 A:middle
And go over the Build
Phases Tab.

473
00:21:36,656 --> 00:21:37,806 A:middle
Click the Plus Button.

474
00:21:38,106 --> 00:21:40,356 A:middle
We can find the iAd Framework.

475
00:21:41,316 --> 00:21:42,916 A:middle
And go ahead and add
that to our project.

476
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:46,196 A:middle
The next thing that
we need to do is go

477
00:21:46,196 --> 00:21:52,786 A:middle
into our Master View Controller
here and Import the iAd Header.

478
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:54,306 A:middle
That gives us access to the API,

479
00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:57,076 A:middle
specifically the
CanDislayBannerAds Property

480
00:21:57,436 --> 00:21:58,426 A:middle
on View Controller.

481
00:21:59,056 --> 00:22:02,116 A:middle
Once we've done that, all we
need to do is set that property

482
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

483
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:04,746 A:middle
on the View Controller
when it wakes up.

484
00:22:05,536 --> 00:22:08,196 A:middle
We can go ahead and save.

485
00:22:09,096 --> 00:22:12,526 A:middle
We can re-run our demo here.

486
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:18,576 A:middle
Now you'll see that
automatically.

487
00:22:18,576 --> 00:22:21,496 A:middle
An ad pops in from the bottom as
soon as the ad request is made,

488
00:22:21,496 --> 00:22:24,556 A:middle
and a new ad has loaded
into your application.

489
00:22:24,696 --> 00:22:29,406 A:middle
If we were to lose network
connectivity and this were

490
00:22:29,406 --> 00:22:32,436 A:middle
to cycle back out, you'd see it
just animate out smoothly just

491
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:34,086 A:middle
as well as it animated in.

492
00:22:34,856 --> 00:22:38,836 A:middle
And with that, I'll bring Nathan
back up to continue the slides.

493
00:22:39,046 --> 00:22:39,806 A:middle
>> Nathan de Vries:
Thanks, David.

494
00:22:40,236 --> 00:22:43,216 A:middle
As you can see, it's pretty
easy to enable banner ads.

495
00:22:43,286 --> 00:22:45,206 A:middle
Just a simple property.

496
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:46,246 A:middle
Very easy to do.

497
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:47,756 A:middle
Pretty cool.

498
00:22:47,756 --> 00:22:49,276 A:middle
This is new in iOS 7.

499
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:52,246 A:middle
So next we're going to talk
about a different type of ad.

500
00:22:52,326 --> 00:22:54,656 A:middle
We've seen a banner
ad which when tapped,

501
00:22:54,776 --> 00:22:56,816 A:middle
presents a full screen
advertisement.

502
00:22:57,266 --> 00:22:58,896 A:middle
The Interstitial is a
little bit different,

503
00:22:58,896 --> 00:22:59,826 A:middle
in that it doesn't have

504
00:22:59,826 --> 00:23:02,326 A:middle
that intermediary
view that you tap on.

505
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

506
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:06,376 A:middle
It immediately launches into
a full-screen advertisement.

507
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:09,826 A:middle
So what usually happens
is, as you're transitioning

508
00:23:09,826 --> 00:23:12,806 A:middle
from one part of your
application into another part,

509
00:23:13,316 --> 00:23:16,496 A:middle
you get this full-screen
advertisement up here.

510
00:23:16,626 --> 00:23:18,946 A:middle
So this is pretty cool.

511
00:23:19,626 --> 00:23:24,426 A:middle
This has been available since
iOS 4.3 on iPad, as of iOS 7,

512
00:23:24,426 --> 00:23:26,966 A:middle
this is all also
available on the iPhone,

513
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:30,236 A:middle
so you can start using
this today on iPhone too.

514
00:23:31,636 --> 00:23:35,076 A:middle
Now when I talk about
automatic presentation

515
00:23:35,076 --> 00:23:37,496 A:middle
of a full-screen view,
when does that happen?

516
00:23:37,646 --> 00:23:40,716 A:middle
As of iOS 7, we now
have this new property

517
00:23:40,716 --> 00:23:42,966 A:middle
on View Controller
similar to the property

518
00:23:43,156 --> 00:23:46,836 A:middle
on the banner ads
called the Interstitial

519
00:23:46,836 --> 00:23:48,096 A:middle
Presentation Policy.

520
00:23:48,446 --> 00:23:52,376 A:middle
And what the iAd framework is
now able to do for you is watch

521
00:23:52,376 --> 00:23:54,696 A:middle
for View Controllers
to become visible,

522
00:23:55,126 --> 00:23:57,556 A:middle
and then present an
interstitial ad automatically

523
00:23:57,886 --> 00:23:59,336 A:middle
when that view becomes visible.

524
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

525
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:02,586 A:middle
So if you've got
a view controller,

526
00:24:02,586 --> 00:24:04,166 A:middle
we can say there's two
View Controllers here;

527
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:07,086 A:middle
one is off-screen, the current
View Controller on-screen,

528
00:24:07,156 --> 00:24:08,866 A:middle
and the next View
Controller off-screen.

529
00:24:09,456 --> 00:24:12,136 A:middle
We want to configure the
Interstitial Presentation Policy

530
00:24:12,206 --> 00:24:14,886 A:middle
of the next View
Controller to be automatic.

531
00:24:15,156 --> 00:24:16,356 A:middle
We want the iAd framework

532
00:24:16,356 --> 00:24:18,926 A:middle
to automatically manage
presentation of an interstitial

533
00:24:19,276 --> 00:24:24,066 A:middle
when it's appropriate based
on inventory and minimum time

534
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:25,776 A:middle
between interstitial
presentations.

535
00:24:26,706 --> 00:24:29,426 A:middle
Now when we call
pushViewController to present

536
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,426 A:middle
that View Controller,

537
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:34,306 A:middle
an interstitial is
automatically presented on top.

538
00:24:35,246 --> 00:24:38,886 A:middle
When the user dismisses the
full-screen interstitial,

539
00:24:39,236 --> 00:24:40,916 A:middle
they're back to that
next View Controller.

540
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:43,326 A:middle
They're back into the app.

541
00:24:43,586 --> 00:24:46,466 A:middle
There's also another option for
applications that are doing,

542
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:49,366 A:middle
maybe single View
Controller style,

543
00:24:49,436 --> 00:24:51,456 A:middle
have the single View
Controller architecture.

544
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:55,266 A:middle
Things like games, where
you need to have control

545
00:24:55,266 --> 00:24:56,806 A:middle
over the presentation
of the interstitial

546
00:24:56,806 --> 00:25:00,006 A:middle
because there's no View
Controller transitions.

547
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

548
00:25:00,036 --> 00:25:02,126 A:middle
So what you need to
do there is instead

549
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,366 A:middle
of setting an automatic
Interstitial Presentation

550
00:25:04,366 --> 00:25:07,316 A:middle
Policy, you set a Manual
Presentation Policy.

551
00:25:07,936 --> 00:25:10,476 A:middle
And what this does, is it
still enables interstitials

552
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:13,286 A:middle
to present automatically
and seamlessly, but you need

553
00:25:13,286 --> 00:25:15,106 A:middle
to request the presentation.

554
00:25:15,676 --> 00:25:18,556 A:middle
So if you're building a
game style application,

555
00:25:19,006 --> 00:25:22,186 A:middle
when you transition
from, say, the game back

556
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:24,476 A:middle
into the menu would
be one example.

557
00:25:24,696 --> 00:25:27,036 A:middle
You can call Request
Interstitial Presentation,

558
00:25:27,036 --> 00:25:31,936 A:middle
and if an ad is available,
it will present.

559
00:25:31,936 --> 00:25:34,396 A:middle
One thing to bear in mind
with interstitial ads is

560
00:25:34,396 --> 00:25:38,176 A:middle
that when you're setting this
property on View Controllers

561
00:25:38,176 --> 00:25:40,146 A:middle
that might happen quite a while

562
00:25:40,146 --> 00:25:42,006 A:middle
after the user has
launched the application.

563
00:25:42,546 --> 00:25:45,226 A:middle
Setting the property on a View
Controller is really the only

564
00:25:45,226 --> 00:25:47,356 A:middle
way for the iAd framework
to know

565
00:25:47,356 --> 00:25:49,706 A:middle
that ad requests
should stop being sent

566
00:25:49,776 --> 00:25:51,116 A:middle
to the iAd App Network.

567
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,336 A:middle
So what you can do
to improve on this is

568
00:25:54,336 --> 00:25:57,976 A:middle
to call Prepare Interstitial
Ads early

569
00:25:57,976 --> 00:25:59,786 A:middle
on in your application's
lifecycle

570
00:25:59,786 --> 00:26:02,216 A:middle
so that you don't miss
those early impressions.

571
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

572
00:26:02,876 --> 00:26:05,546 A:middle
And with that, I'm going

573
00:26:05,546 --> 00:26:07,516 A:middle
to bring David back
up to do a demo.

574
00:26:07,796 --> 00:26:08,066 A:middle
>> David Wilson: Okay.

575
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:08,766 A:middle
So we're going to go back

576
00:26:08,866 --> 00:26:10,606 A:middle
to the application we
just took a look at,

577
00:26:10,606 --> 00:26:13,016 A:middle
and we added a banner view
to the bottom of the list

578
00:26:13,016 --> 00:26:15,846 A:middle
of articles, and now we want to
add interstitial presentation

579
00:26:16,206 --> 00:26:18,586 A:middle
when the user taps on one
of those articles to go

580
00:26:18,586 --> 00:26:19,986 A:middle
into the actual article view.

581
00:26:20,356 --> 00:26:22,966 A:middle
We can go back, remember, and
this is what our app looked

582
00:26:22,966 --> 00:26:24,556 A:middle
like when we last left it.

583
00:26:24,556 --> 00:26:26,226 A:middle
We've got ads at the
bottom, and you can see

584
00:26:26,226 --> 00:26:27,186 A:middle
that they're cycling there.

585
00:26:27,746 --> 00:26:29,876 A:middle
We can go back to Xcode.

586
00:26:30,426 --> 00:26:33,386 A:middle
Now as Nathan mentioned,
it's important to tell iAd

587
00:26:33,386 --> 00:26:37,286 A:middle
that you're going to want to
present interstitial as early

588
00:26:37,286 --> 00:26:39,036 A:middle
as possible in the
app's lifecycle.

589
00:26:39,486 --> 00:26:43,576 A:middle
That allows iAd to go ahead and
make ad requests on your behalf

590
00:26:43,576 --> 00:26:46,976 A:middle
so that an interstitial is ready
when the user takes the action

591
00:26:46,976 --> 00:26:48,756 A:middle
that would present it.

592
00:26:49,256 --> 00:26:51,316 A:middle
So the first thing we're going
to do is we're going to go

593
00:26:51,316 --> 00:26:53,076 A:middle
over to our app delegate.

594
00:26:54,386 --> 00:26:57,536 A:middle
We're going to import
the iAd Header here,

595
00:26:57,536 --> 00:27:00,866 A:middle
and then inside our app
delegates did finish launching

596
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

597
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,186 A:middle
with Options Call.

598
00:27:02,566 --> 00:27:04,836 A:middle
We want to go ahead and
call UIViewController,

599
00:27:04,836 --> 00:27:06,626 A:middle
Prepare Interstitial Ads.

600
00:27:07,276 --> 00:27:10,926 A:middle
This allows iAd to begin
making those ad requests

601
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,626 A:middle
at the beginning of
your application.

602
00:27:12,626 --> 00:27:14,936 A:middle
That means the moment
the user takes action,

603
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:16,876 A:middle
we're going to have
ads available for you.

604
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:19,846 A:middle
Once we've done that,
we can go back

605
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,356 A:middle
to our Master View
Controller here,

606
00:27:21,356 --> 00:27:23,586 A:middle
and we've already
imported the iAd Header,

607
00:27:23,656 --> 00:27:24,746 A:middle
which was the important bit.

608
00:27:24,746 --> 00:27:29,326 A:middle
And we go down to the bottom
of this to prepare for segue.

609
00:27:29,616 --> 00:27:32,026 A:middle
Here we've set up our
Detail View Controller.

610
00:27:32,136 --> 00:27:34,176 A:middle
We've set the Article URL on it.

611
00:27:34,606 --> 00:27:36,546 A:middle
And once we've done
that, we just also need

612
00:27:36,546 --> 00:27:37,926 A:middle
to set one more property,

613
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:40,686 A:middle
which is the Interstitial
Presentation Policy.

614
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,026 A:middle
And once we've done
that, we can save again.

615
00:27:44,126 --> 00:27:46,916 A:middle
We can go ahead and Run.

616
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:54,076 A:middle
Okay. So we've got our
application back up.

617
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:57,066 A:middle
Give it a second and the
banner should kick in here.

618
00:27:57,666 --> 00:27:59,646 A:middle
And then behind the scenes,

619
00:27:59,646 --> 00:28:01,176 A:middle
we're also making
interstitial requests

620
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

621
00:28:01,176 --> 00:28:04,216 A:middle
which we'll be loading
an ad for us.

622
00:28:04,406 --> 00:28:09,136 A:middle
Note that the default
fill rate for development

623
00:28:09,136 --> 00:28:10,606 A:middle
of the application is 80%.

624
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,946 A:middle
You will want to change
that again as Nathan pointed

625
00:28:13,946 --> 00:28:17,596 A:middle
out if you want to test things
work all the time, versus never,

626
00:28:18,346 --> 00:28:19,856 A:middle
go ahead and click on one

627
00:28:19,856 --> 00:28:26,626 A:middle
of the articles here,
and not get an ad.

628
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:29,616 A:middle
We got one down there.

629
00:28:29,806 --> 00:28:30,196 A:middle
There we go.

630
00:28:30,316 --> 00:28:32,556 A:middle
So the user's tapped on
the article headline.

631
00:28:32,616 --> 00:28:33,696 A:middle
They've gone in the
article view,

632
00:28:33,696 --> 00:28:37,286 A:middle
and the full-screen ad has
presented over the article view.

633
00:28:37,846 --> 00:28:40,476 A:middle
Once the user has finished
engaging with this ad,

634
00:28:40,516 --> 00:28:45,276 A:middle
they can go ahead and close that
ad, and they're back immediately

635
00:28:45,276 --> 00:28:46,276 A:middle
into your View Controller.

636
00:28:47,076 --> 00:28:50,086 A:middle
And with that, I'll bring Nathan
back up to continue the slides.

637
00:28:50,086 --> 00:28:51,416 A:middle
>> Nathan de Vries: So simply,

638
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:53,546 A:middle
setting the Interstitial
Presentation Policy

639
00:28:53,546 --> 00:28:54,696 A:middle
on your View Controllers,

640
00:28:54,696 --> 00:28:57,146 A:middle
and you get this
automatic view controller

641
00:28:57,146 --> 00:28:58,486 A:middle
interstitial presentation.

642
00:28:58,806 --> 00:28:59,566 A:middle
It's pretty easy.

643
00:28:59,566 --> 00:29:01,316 A:middle
Pretty easy to get started.

644
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

645
00:29:01,886 --> 00:29:04,286 A:middle
So next we're going to look

646
00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:09,416 A:middle
at this ad type called the IAB
Medium Rectangle Advertisement.

647
00:29:10,346 --> 00:29:12,286 A:middle
So what is this?

648
00:29:12,286 --> 00:29:16,406 A:middle
It's a view that's very similar
to a banner view, except instead

649
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:18,496 A:middle
of being positioned at the
bottom of your content,

650
00:29:18,496 --> 00:29:20,466 A:middle
it's positioned in-line
with your content.

651
00:29:21,186 --> 00:29:24,586 A:middle
The size of this
view is prescribed

652
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:27,596 A:middle
by the Interactive
Advertising Viewer,

653
00:29:27,626 --> 00:29:30,726 A:middle
which is why it's called the
Medium Rectangle Advertisement.

654
00:29:30,726 --> 00:29:32,536 A:middle
You might have seen
this on websites.

655
00:29:33,086 --> 00:29:36,306 A:middle
It's 250 points by 300 points.

656
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:40,336 A:middle
It also has a similar cycling
behavior as the banner view,

657
00:29:40,336 --> 00:29:44,556 A:middle
so as new ads become available,
the ad cycle in the view.

658
00:29:45,766 --> 00:29:49,446 A:middle
And, again, like
the banner content,

659
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:53,066 A:middle
you also get full
screen ads on tap.

660
00:29:53,736 --> 00:29:56,636 A:middle
This was introduced
in iOS 6 [inaudible],

661
00:29:56,636 --> 00:29:59,406 A:middle
and it's available only on iPad.

662
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,896 A:middle
So how do we create
one of these things?

663
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

664
00:30:02,376 --> 00:30:04,496 A:middle
As you noticed, it
was positioned in-line

665
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:07,686 A:middle
in the content, so you have
this greater flexibility

666
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:10,706 A:middle
and positioning of the
view within your content.

667
00:30:10,766 --> 00:30:15,076 A:middle
So to do that, we need to
create this banner view

668
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,366 A:middle
of type medium rectangle.

669
00:30:17,796 --> 00:30:20,976 A:middle
So here you can see after we've
imported the headers like we did

670
00:30:20,976 --> 00:30:23,806 A:middle
for the banner view, we
created this new banner view

671
00:30:23,806 --> 00:30:25,546 A:middle
of type medium rectangle.

672
00:30:25,956 --> 00:30:30,526 A:middle
And this is going to create
nearly unloaded medium

673
00:30:30,526 --> 00:30:31,626 A:middle
rectangle view.

674
00:30:32,606 --> 00:30:35,316 A:middle
So we also need to configure
ourselves as the delegate

675
00:30:35,316 --> 00:30:38,146 A:middle
of this view because
as ads become available

676
00:30:38,326 --> 00:30:43,376 A:middle
and unavailable inside this
banner view, we need to be told

677
00:30:43,376 --> 00:30:45,916 A:middle
so we know when to
present the view onscreen

678
00:30:46,006 --> 00:30:46,956 A:middle
and take it off screen.

679
00:30:47,456 --> 00:30:49,006 A:middle
So we set ourselves
as the delegate,

680
00:30:49,006 --> 00:30:51,706 A:middle
and the protocol
that's used to talk

681
00:30:51,706 --> 00:30:54,996 A:middle
to that delegate is the 80
Banner View Delegate protocol.

682
00:30:55,156 --> 00:30:57,816 A:middle
So whichever object you've
assigned as the delegate needs

683
00:30:57,816 --> 00:31:00,366 A:middle
to conform to the 80 Banner
View Delegate protocol.

684
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

685
00:31:00,696 --> 00:31:01,596 A:middle
So we do that as well.

686
00:31:03,406 --> 00:31:05,356 A:middle
When the banner is
ready to load,

687
00:31:05,426 --> 00:31:06,886 A:middle
so we get this Delegate
Callback.

688
00:31:07,426 --> 00:31:10,126 A:middle
That callback is called the
Banner View Did Load Callback.

689
00:31:10,426 --> 00:31:11,316 A:middle
Called on the delegate.

690
00:31:12,086 --> 00:31:14,916 A:middle
And when this happens,
that's an opportunity for you

691
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:17,286 A:middle
to present the ad on screen.

692
00:31:17,286 --> 00:31:18,686 A:middle
We now have an ad
fulfilled by an ad request.

693
00:31:18,686 --> 00:31:21,016 A:middle
We now have an ad
fulfilled by an ad request.

694
00:31:21,316 --> 00:31:23,096 A:middle
We now need to turn
that into an impression.

695
00:31:23,906 --> 00:31:27,186 A:middle
So to do that, you can do your
custom layout however you would

696
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:29,326 A:middle
like to present that view.

697
00:31:29,326 --> 00:31:32,926 A:middle
You could cross-fade it in,
readjust your other views,

698
00:31:33,156 --> 00:31:36,146 A:middle
and present that medium
rectangle ad in-line

699
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:36,916 A:middle
with your content.

700
00:31:39,496 --> 00:31:43,886 A:middle
Similarly to banner ads, when
the medium rectangle is tapped,

701
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:45,636 A:middle
you get the full-screen ad.

702
00:31:46,316 --> 00:31:48,846 A:middle
You also need to use
the view will disappear

703
00:31:48,846 --> 00:31:52,826 A:middle
and view will appear callbacks
to pause any activity and sounds

704
00:31:52,826 --> 00:31:57,326 A:middle
in your application to prevent
them clashing with any sounds

705
00:31:57,326 --> 00:32:01,126 A:middle
and media that are
being played in the ad.

706
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

707
00:32:01,396 --> 00:32:04,406 A:middle
When it comes time to unload
that medium rectangle,

708
00:32:04,816 --> 00:32:06,186 A:middle
the next callback you'll receive

709
00:32:06,186 --> 00:32:09,586 A:middle
on our Delegate is called the
bannerviewdidFailToReceiveAd

710
00:32:09,586 --> 00:32:10,846 A:middle
with Error Callback.

711
00:32:11,536 --> 00:32:14,486 A:middle
And this is an opportunity for
you to remove due to the reverse

712
00:32:14,586 --> 00:32:16,836 A:middle
of adding the view to the
view hierarchy, and you want

713
00:32:16,836 --> 00:32:18,106 A:middle
to move it off screen.

714
00:32:18,866 --> 00:32:20,126 A:middle
It's important to
keep in mind here

715
00:32:20,126 --> 00:32:25,736 A:middle
that you shouldn't just throw
away the medium rects ad view

716
00:32:26,186 --> 00:32:27,446 A:middle
because you can just
keep it around.

717
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,546 A:middle
It'll continue to
cycle with new ads.

718
00:32:29,836 --> 00:32:32,576 A:middle
So as those new ads
become available,

719
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:36,636 A:middle
you can simply add the same
medium rectangle ad view back

720
00:32:36,636 --> 00:32:38,496 A:middle
to your views hierarchy.

721
00:32:40,176 --> 00:32:44,146 A:middle
So much like banner
ads, we have some tools

722
00:32:44,146 --> 00:32:46,486 A:middle
for testing medium rectangles.

723
00:32:46,926 --> 00:32:48,916 A:middle
We still have the
adjustments to fill rate.

724
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:50,746 A:middle
They also work with
these medium recs.

725
00:32:51,126 --> 00:32:52,766 A:middle
We have adjustments
to refresh rate.

726
00:32:52,986 --> 00:32:54,386 A:middle
Same as we discussed before.

727
00:32:54,386 --> 00:32:59,216 A:middle
But there's another additional
toggle that you can flip used

728
00:32:59,216 --> 00:33:02,446 A:middle
for medium rectangles because
you're positioning them often

729
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

730
00:33:02,446 --> 00:33:04,666 A:middle
in very specific ways
in line with content,

731
00:33:05,096 --> 00:33:09,316 A:middle
and what that switch does is
it helps you avoid any clipping

732
00:33:09,316 --> 00:33:10,416 A:middle
of that ad view.

733
00:33:10,946 --> 00:33:13,416 A:middle
So we really want to
avoid clipping the ad view

734
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:16,256 A:middle
because that can prevent the
user from being able to see it

735
00:33:16,256 --> 00:33:17,566 A:middle
or the user being
able to tap it,

736
00:33:17,706 --> 00:33:20,456 A:middle
so by flipping the
highlight clipped banners,

737
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:24,336 A:middle
you get these overlaid
red or green views on top

738
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:27,126 A:middle
of your medium rects to show
whether it's being clipped

739
00:33:27,126 --> 00:33:27,406 A:middle
or not.

740
00:33:27,726 --> 00:33:31,016 A:middle
So make sure that you
run your application

741
00:33:31,016 --> 00:33:32,996 A:middle
with this flag enabled
in Settings

742
00:33:33,266 --> 00:33:36,406 A:middle
to make sure your medium
rects aren't being clipped.

743
00:33:37,236 --> 00:33:39,676 A:middle
So let's get a demo of that.

744
00:33:40,506 --> 00:33:40,896 A:middle
>> David Wilson: Okay.

745
00:33:41,296 --> 00:33:44,716 A:middle
So to enter it medium rectangles

746
00:33:44,716 --> 00:33:49,326 A:middle
into an application is a
little more complicated,

747
00:33:49,326 --> 00:33:50,246 A:middle
as Nathan mentioned.

748
00:33:50,636 --> 00:33:52,966 A:middle
So to do that, we're going to
start with a new application,

749
00:33:52,966 --> 00:33:55,646 A:middle
and this is sort of a
bit of a game simulation.

750
00:33:56,236 --> 00:33:59,736 A:middle
Most of the screen is going to
be taken up by the simulation.

751
00:33:59,736 --> 00:34:00,766 A:middle
There's some text at the bottom

752
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

753
00:34:00,766 --> 00:34:03,756 A:middle
that has some wasted white
space, and we're going to try

754
00:34:03,756 --> 00:34:05,426 A:middle
to take advantage of
some of that white space,

755
00:34:05,426 --> 00:34:06,696 A:middle
to include a medium rect

756
00:34:06,696 --> 00:34:08,456 A:middle
in the bottom left
corner of our screen.

757
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:12,025 A:middle
Okay. So, anyway, you just
have to trust me that we have

758
00:34:12,025 --> 00:34:14,835 A:middle
as a simulation at the top, and
we have some text at the bottom,

759
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:18,045 A:middle
and we've got a medium rectangle
that we're going to want to put

760
00:34:18,045 --> 00:34:19,846 A:middle
on the bottom left
corner of the screen.

761
00:34:20,456 --> 00:34:23,896 A:middle
So to do that, as we did
in our previous project,

762
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:25,606 A:middle
the first thing we're
going to need to do is link

763
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,406 A:middle
against the iAd framework.

764
00:34:27,696 --> 00:34:31,315 A:middle
So click on our project
here, go over to Build Phases

765
00:34:31,315 --> 00:34:33,166 A:middle
for the appropriate target.

766
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:35,846 A:middle
Link binary with Libraries.

767
00:34:35,846 --> 00:34:39,656 A:middle
And we're going to link
in the iAd framework.

768
00:34:40,136 --> 00:34:42,926 A:middle
Remember this is an
iPad only feature,

769
00:34:42,926 --> 00:34:46,606 A:middle
so we can't actually demo
it with the iOS 7 STK today.

770
00:34:46,846 --> 00:34:51,356 A:middle
But you can build applications
to run against iOS 6.1,

771
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:54,396 A:middle
and they will work with
the next seed for iOS 7.

772
00:34:55,146 --> 00:34:57,126 A:middle
Once we've linked
against the iAd framework,

773
00:34:57,556 --> 00:35:00,526 A:middle
the next thing we need to do
is go to our View Controller.

774
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

775
00:35:01,446 --> 00:35:03,616 A:middle
We're going to go ahead and
Import the iAd framework here

776
00:35:03,616 --> 00:35:05,676 A:middle
to give us access
to these API's.

777
00:35:06,496 --> 00:35:08,506 A:middle
And because we need
to have a delegate

778
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,676 A:middle
for the medium rect banner view,

779
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:12,596 A:middle
we're going to make
our View Controller

780
00:35:12,706 --> 00:35:16,326 A:middle
that 80 Banner View Delegate,
and then we're going to set

781
00:35:16,326 --> 00:35:21,266 A:middle
up a couple properties to hold
the new 80 Banner View Medium

782
00:35:21,266 --> 00:35:24,216 A:middle
Rect that we're going to create,
and to keep track of whether

783
00:35:24,216 --> 00:35:26,396 A:middle
or not the ad is
currently visible on screen.

784
00:35:26,756 --> 00:35:29,046 A:middle
We're going to need this so that
we can do the appropriate layout

785
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:31,656 A:middle
as the banner view
loads and unloads.

786
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:35,926 A:middle
So once we have those
properties inside Load View,

787
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:39,156 A:middle
we can go ahead and
instantiate that.

788
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:41,946 A:middle
Note that all we have to
do is alloc initWithAd:

789
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:45,146 A:middle
ADAdTypeMediumRectangle,
and then remember

790
00:35:45,146 --> 00:35:48,216 A:middle
to set the delegate to
the View Controller.

791
00:35:49,056 --> 00:35:50,776 A:middle
Once we've done that, we need

792
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:53,526 A:middle
to update our
viewDidLayoutSubviews method

793
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,486 A:middle
so that we can include the
medium rect inside our layout.

794
00:35:57,316 --> 00:36:01,526 A:middle
So all we need to do here is
do some frame calculations

795
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

796
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:03,136 A:middle
for the medium rect,
which puts it,

797
00:36:03,936 --> 00:36:06,446 A:middle
with the calculations
here we're doing is layout

798
00:36:06,446 --> 00:36:09,016 A:middle
out the medium rect in the
bottom left of the screen

799
00:36:09,016 --> 00:36:11,226 A:middle
if it's loaded, and
just off-screen

800
00:36:11,226 --> 00:36:13,066 A:middle
in the bottom left,
if it's not loaded.

801
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:16,636 A:middle
That allows us to do smooth
animated transitions on

802
00:36:16,636 --> 00:36:19,046 A:middle
and off screen, as
the loaded property

803
00:36:19,046 --> 00:36:20,416 A:middle
of this banner view changes.

804
00:36:20,856 --> 00:36:23,676 A:middle
To do that, we're also going
to need to adjust the origin

805
00:36:23,676 --> 00:36:25,066 A:middle
of the frame that's next to it.

806
00:36:25,206 --> 00:36:27,816 A:middle
Once we've done that,
then we need

807
00:36:27,816 --> 00:36:30,656 A:middle
to actually start implementing
the delegate method callbacks

808
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:33,236 A:middle
that will tell us when things
happen with this banner view.

809
00:36:33,976 --> 00:36:37,066 A:middle
So the first thing we're going
to do is go down to the bottom

810
00:36:37,616 --> 00:36:40,516 A:middle
and hide the rest of this.

811
00:36:40,686 --> 00:36:43,366 A:middle
Then we go to first start

812
00:36:43,366 --> 00:36:46,186 A:middle
out by implementing
bannerViewDidLoadAd.

813
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:50,296 A:middle
This is our cue to move
the banner onscreen

814
00:36:50,406 --> 00:36:51,736 A:middle
if it's not already there.

815
00:36:52,256 --> 00:36:55,396 A:middle
This is iAd telling us that
there's a new ad that's in place

816
00:36:55,396 --> 00:36:57,196 A:middle
in the view and we should
display it to the user.

817
00:36:58,016 --> 00:36:59,376 A:middle
If it's already visible,
that's fine.

818
00:36:59,376 --> 00:37:01,226 A:middle
We don't need to
take any action.

819
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

820
00:37:01,226 --> 00:37:03,636 A:middle
If it's not, we're going
to set our property here

821
00:37:03,636 --> 00:37:06,316 A:middle
and then we're just going
to do a quick animation

822
00:37:06,316 --> 00:37:09,556 A:middle
to move this thing onscreen by
just calling setNeedsLayout,

823
00:37:09,816 --> 00:37:12,286 A:middle
layoutIfNeeded, and letting
the layout code that we did

824
00:37:12,286 --> 00:37:14,096 A:middle
up above handle this for us.

825
00:37:15,176 --> 00:37:17,316 A:middle
Now once the banner's been
onscreen for a little while,

826
00:37:17,316 --> 00:37:20,336 A:middle
we're going to have to move it
back off screen if it unloads,

827
00:37:20,936 --> 00:37:23,296 A:middle
say the user moves out
of network connectivity,

828
00:37:23,296 --> 00:37:25,176 A:middle
or we just run out of inventory.

829
00:37:25,266 --> 00:37:26,746 A:middle
So we're going to implement

830
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:29,276 A:middle
in this case the
bannerViewDidFailToLoadAd

831
00:37:29,276 --> 00:37:30,776 A:middle
with error method.

832
00:37:30,776 --> 00:37:34,276 A:middle
This is almost identical
to moving it onscreen,

833
00:37:34,276 --> 00:37:36,346 A:middle
except we're going to
change our property to No,

834
00:37:37,016 --> 00:37:39,626 A:middle
and then we're going to
again do an animation based

835
00:37:39,626 --> 00:37:41,786 A:middle
on setNeedsLayout,
layoutIfNeeded.

836
00:37:42,196 --> 00:37:44,506 A:middle
So that'll move the
thing on and off screen,

837
00:37:44,506 --> 00:37:46,306 A:middle
but there's one more thing
we need to take care of,

838
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:47,986 A:middle
and that's pausing our game

839
00:37:47,986 --> 00:37:49,886 A:middle
when the user actually
interacts with this ad.

840
00:37:50,196 --> 00:37:51,506 A:middle
We've got a simulation running.

841
00:37:51,506 --> 00:37:52,776 A:middle
It's taking up CPU.

842
00:37:53,046 --> 00:37:54,876 A:middle
Maybe the user is actually
interested in watching

843
00:37:54,876 --> 00:37:57,236 A:middle
that simulation, and we
don't want to let it just go

844
00:37:57,236 --> 00:38:00,606 A:middle
on behind the scenes while the
user's interacting with the ad.

845
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

846
00:38:01,226 --> 00:38:02,636 A:middle
So to do that, we're
going to go ahead

847
00:38:02,636 --> 00:38:05,496 A:middle
and implement view did
appear, view did disappear

848
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:08,466 A:middle
on our view controller, and
all we need to do here is start

849
00:38:08,466 --> 00:38:11,066 A:middle
and stop timers that are
running our simulation.

850
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:14,136 A:middle
If you had media, this would
also be your cure to pause

851
00:38:14,136 --> 00:38:15,506 A:middle
and then resume the media.

852
00:38:16,196 --> 00:38:17,356 A:middle
Once we've done that,

853
00:38:17,806 --> 00:38:19,856 A:middle
if our demo machine were
working we could run it again,

854
00:38:20,076 --> 00:38:22,636 A:middle
but that's pretty much
all you need to do

855
00:38:22,636 --> 00:38:25,056 A:middle
to get medium rects
integrated into your app.

856
00:38:25,656 --> 00:38:27,126 A:middle
And with that I'll
bring Nathan back out.

857
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:29,626 A:middle
>> Nathan de Vries: So the next
ad type which we're excited

858
00:38:29,626 --> 00:38:32,576 A:middle
to talk about today, is
the pre-roll video ad.

859
00:38:32,856 --> 00:38:36,006 A:middle
We've had a lot of requests for
this, and it's new to iOS 7,

860
00:38:36,506 --> 00:38:39,586 A:middle
and what this lets you do
is integrate seamlessly

861
00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:41,276 A:middle
with the media player API's

862
00:38:41,506 --> 00:38:45,616 A:middle
to request playback all the
video before your video content.

863
00:38:46,376 --> 00:38:48,586 A:middle
So as I said, it's
brand new in iOS 7.

864
00:38:49,136 --> 00:38:52,036 A:middle
It's integrated with
the media player API's.

865
00:38:52,036 --> 00:38:54,486 A:middle
So the way you would
normally play back media

866
00:38:54,486 --> 00:38:56,476 A:middle
with the MP movie
player controller API,

867
00:38:57,076 --> 00:38:59,286 A:middle
you can now just
use a different API

868
00:38:59,406 --> 00:39:03,576 A:middle
to play a pre-roll
ad before that media.

869
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

870
00:39:03,786 --> 00:39:05,426 A:middle
When the pre-roll
starts playing,

871
00:39:05,716 --> 00:39:08,846 A:middle
this happens before the
media content starts playing,

872
00:39:08,926 --> 00:39:11,826 A:middle
your primary media
content starts playing,

873
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:13,916 A:middle
and when the advertisement
finishes,

874
00:39:14,216 --> 00:39:17,406 A:middle
you get this seamless transition
to the main content video.

875
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:21,736 A:middle
If the user engages with the
video while it's displayed

876
00:39:21,736 --> 00:39:22,846 A:middle
with this pre-roll video,

877
00:39:23,196 --> 00:39:26,356 A:middle
they get that standard
full-screen immersive ad

878
00:39:26,356 --> 00:39:27,546 A:middle
experience as well.

879
00:39:27,546 --> 00:39:29,816 A:middle
Just like all of the other
advertisements we support.

880
00:39:30,856 --> 00:39:33,186 A:middle
We also support Inline playback.

881
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,656 A:middle
So if you've got an application

882
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:37,716 A:middle
that doesn't assume
full-screen media playback,

883
00:39:38,036 --> 00:39:40,776 A:middle
then you can also use
pre-roll video in that scenario

884
00:39:40,776 --> 00:39:43,556 A:middle
by using the embedded style
for MP movie player controller,

885
00:39:43,556 --> 00:39:47,676 A:middle
and this is supported
on both iPhone and iPad.

886
00:39:48,156 --> 00:39:50,806 A:middle
So let's take a look
at how to create one

887
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,626 A:middle
of these MP movie
player controllers.

888
00:39:53,506 --> 00:39:56,436 A:middle
In addition to the usual iAd
framework import that you need

889
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:57,826 A:middle
to do for the other ad types,

890
00:39:58,236 --> 00:40:00,516 A:middle
the MP movie player
controller functionality is

891
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

892
00:40:00,516 --> 00:40:03,006 A:middle
in the media player framework.

893
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:04,756 A:middle
So you'll need to
link media player

894
00:40:05,216 --> 00:40:07,576 A:middle
and also import the
media player headers.

895
00:40:09,086 --> 00:40:11,906 A:middle
We then need to create a new
MP movie player controller,

896
00:40:12,116 --> 00:40:14,106 A:middle
or an MP movie player
view controller,

897
00:40:14,196 --> 00:40:17,516 A:middle
depending on your application,
and set the content URL

898
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,176 A:middle
of that movie player controller.

899
00:40:19,526 --> 00:40:21,416 A:middle
This is the usual video content

900
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:23,296 A:middle
that you would have been
playing before you started

901
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,576 A:middle
integrating iAd.

902
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:28,046 A:middle
After we've done that, instead
of calling the play method

903
00:40:28,046 --> 00:40:29,506 A:middle
on the movie player controller,

904
00:40:29,756 --> 00:40:33,456 A:middle
iAd has this new category
method called playPrerollAdWith

905
00:40:33,456 --> 00:40:35,406 A:middle
CompletionHandler,
which allows you

906
00:40:35,406 --> 00:40:37,916 A:middle
to provide a completion
block that gets called

907
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:41,726 A:middle
after the ad finishes, or if
there was no other ad available

908
00:40:41,726 --> 00:40:44,606 A:middle
at the time of requesting
a pre-roll ad.

909
00:40:44,786 --> 00:40:47,646 A:middle
Once you've called this API,
you can immediately add,

910
00:40:48,126 --> 00:40:52,676 A:middle
so inside that handler, once
the playback has finished,

911
00:40:52,856 --> 00:40:54,916 A:middle
or if there wasn't a
pre-roll available,

912
00:40:55,366 --> 00:40:57,896 A:middle
that's your opportunity
to call the play API

913
00:40:57,896 --> 00:41:01,826 A:middle
and play your original
video content.

914
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

915
00:41:03,426 --> 00:41:04,936 A:middle
Once you've called
this Play Pre-Roll Ad

916
00:41:04,936 --> 00:41:06,236 A:middle
with Completion Handler API,

917
00:41:06,786 --> 00:41:09,066 A:middle
you can then add the movie
player controllers view

918
00:41:09,096 --> 00:41:10,266 A:middle
to your view hierarchy,

919
00:41:10,566 --> 00:41:13,166 A:middle
or you can present the
movie player view controller

920
00:41:13,376 --> 00:41:14,466 A:middle
in your application.

921
00:41:15,076 --> 00:41:19,226 A:middle
If you've got an app that has
a scenario where you would

922
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:22,136 A:middle
like to conditionally play
pre-roll for some users

923
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:25,426 A:middle
and not others, or maybe you've
got some time based logic as to

924
00:41:25,426 --> 00:41:28,806 A:middle
when you want to show pre-roll
ads, you can do that too.

925
00:41:29,316 --> 00:41:32,706 A:middle
All you need to do is
call the play API instead

926
00:41:32,706 --> 00:41:36,236 A:middle
of calling the Play Pre-Roll
Ad with Completion Handler API.

927
00:41:36,236 --> 00:41:38,966 A:middle
And you can come up with your
own logic for when you do

928
00:41:38,966 --> 00:41:40,726 A:middle
and you don't, display
pre-roll ads,

929
00:41:40,776 --> 00:41:44,566 A:middle
and which situations are
optimal for your app.

930
00:41:46,056 --> 00:41:49,136 A:middle
Much like interstitial ads,
you also need to prepare early.

931
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:50,696 A:middle
You need to tell
the ad framework

932
00:41:50,696 --> 00:41:53,006 A:middle
that it should start
sending requests as soon

933
00:41:53,006 --> 00:41:55,586 A:middle
as the application launches,
so that the first time

934
00:41:55,586 --> 00:41:57,086 A:middle
that a user taps on a video,

935
00:41:57,416 --> 00:42:00,046 A:middle
a pre-roll ad is more
likely to be available.

936
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

937
00:42:00,546 --> 00:42:02,856 A:middle
It's all about not missing
those early impressions.

938
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:05,806 A:middle
So similarly to the
UIViewController,

939
00:42:05,806 --> 00:42:07,446 A:middle
preparing [inaudible]
ads called,

940
00:42:08,076 --> 00:42:13,376 A:middle
we now swap that with an MP
movie player controller prepare

941
00:42:13,376 --> 00:42:14,626 A:middle
pre-roll ads [inaudible].

942
00:42:14,716 --> 00:42:16,676 A:middle
And this will do the
same effective thing.

943
00:42:16,676 --> 00:42:18,356 A:middle
It's sending off
ad requests as soon

944
00:42:18,356 --> 00:42:20,706 A:middle
as your application
becomes available.

945
00:42:21,326 --> 00:42:25,626 A:middle
So there are a couple of gotchas

946
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,166 A:middle
with the movie player
controller API.

947
00:42:28,916 --> 00:42:32,046 A:middle
Those of you that are already
using MP movie player controller

948
00:42:32,046 --> 00:42:34,456 A:middle
will need to keep in
mind that you may need

949
00:42:34,456 --> 00:42:37,546 A:middle
to adjust your application
to accommodate pre-roll ads.

950
00:42:38,516 --> 00:42:40,826 A:middle
The first thing that you
need to make sure of is

951
00:42:40,826 --> 00:42:45,026 A:middle
that if you're ever explicitly
playing your MP movie player

952
00:42:45,426 --> 00:42:48,166 A:middle
controller, you need to make
sure that that doesn't happen

953
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:50,046 A:middle
until the completion
handler is pulled.

954
00:42:50,536 --> 00:42:54,106 A:middle
This is because it's the main
content starts playing while the

955
00:42:54,106 --> 00:42:54,936 A:middle
pre-roll is playing,

956
00:42:55,196 --> 00:42:57,406 A:middle
we'll immediately skip
to the main content.

957
00:42:57,996 --> 00:42:59,376 A:middle
So bear that in mind.

958
00:42:59,906 --> 00:43:02,686 A:middle
There's two slightly indirect
times that this can happen.

959
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

960
00:43:03,056 --> 00:43:06,756 A:middle
Many people will observe
these two notifications

961
00:43:06,756 --> 00:43:10,096 A:middle
on MP movie player controller,
when the video becomes available

962
00:43:10,096 --> 00:43:12,496 A:middle
for playback, and also
when the first frame

963
00:43:12,496 --> 00:43:14,406 A:middle
of the video is available
for display.

964
00:43:15,066 --> 00:43:18,146 A:middle
A lot of developers use
these and rightly so,

965
00:43:18,146 --> 00:43:20,446 A:middle
for playing back the media
content, but you need

966
00:43:20,446 --> 00:43:23,006 A:middle
to be aware that if you
call play in response

967
00:43:23,006 --> 00:43:26,656 A:middle
to these notifications, you
may skip the pre-roll adds,

968
00:43:26,656 --> 00:43:28,826 A:middle
so make sure that you don't
handle these notifications

969
00:43:28,826 --> 00:43:33,646 A:middle
until after the callback
handler is called, and likewise

970
00:43:33,646 --> 00:43:35,196 A:middle
if your customizing the UI

971
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:37,746 A:middle
of the MP movie player
controller, which is supported.

972
00:43:37,746 --> 00:43:42,396 A:middle
You also need to hold off on
inserting any custom views

973
00:43:42,396 --> 00:43:45,196 A:middle
into the view controller's
view until after

974
00:43:45,196 --> 00:43:46,676 A:middle
that completion handler
is called

975
00:43:46,736 --> 00:43:50,186 A:middle
because you don't want your
views colliding with any

976
00:43:50,186 --> 00:43:51,216 A:middle
of the pre-roll content.

977
00:43:53,226 --> 00:43:55,566 A:middle
And let's bring David
up for a demo of that.

978
00:43:55,856 --> 00:43:57,686 A:middle
>>David: To start off with
to demonstrate pre-roll adds,

979
00:43:57,686 --> 00:44:01,456 A:middle
we're going to start with this
very simple collection view

980
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

981
00:44:01,456 --> 00:44:02,746 A:middle
application on the phone.

982
00:44:02,746 --> 00:44:05,466 A:middle
Just has one view controller
that's a collection of views,

983
00:44:05,466 --> 00:44:09,346 A:middle
and hold a set of thumbnails for
videos, and the user can tap one

984
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:11,766 A:middle
of those thumbnails
to go into the video.

985
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:12,436 A:middle
That's great.

986
00:44:12,436 --> 00:44:14,206 A:middle
We can go ahead and see
what that looks like.

987
00:44:14,786 --> 00:44:17,506 A:middle
We have a few short videos here.

988
00:44:17,506 --> 00:44:21,146 A:middle
We can tap one of them,
and the video plays.

989
00:44:21,146 --> 00:44:22,636 A:middle
What we want to do is instead

990
00:44:22,636 --> 00:44:24,166 A:middle
of just having the
video play immediately,

991
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:26,626 A:middle
we want to put a pre-roll
in front of that video

992
00:44:26,816 --> 00:44:28,396 A:middle
so we can monetize
our application.

993
00:44:28,576 --> 00:44:31,136 A:middle
So let's take a look
at what that takes.

994
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:34,526 A:middle
So we're going to
pull up Xcode again.

995
00:44:34,526 --> 00:44:36,926 A:middle
The first thing we need to do,

996
00:44:37,326 --> 00:44:39,566 A:middle
as we did in the previous
two demos, is to go ahead

997
00:44:39,566 --> 00:44:41,576 A:middle
and make sure we link
against the iAd framework.

998
00:44:41,756 --> 00:44:43,896 A:middle
We'll go ahead and
click on our project,

999
00:44:44,046 --> 00:44:47,246 A:middle
make sure the right target
is selected, build phases,

1000
00:44:47,696 --> 00:44:50,676 A:middle
and link against
the iAd framework.

1001
00:44:52,076 --> 00:44:55,246 A:middle
Once we've done that, just
as with the interstitials,

1002
00:44:55,246 --> 00:44:58,906 A:middle
it's important to tell iAd early
in the application's lifecycle

1003
00:44:58,906 --> 00:45:00,486 A:middle
that you want pre-roll ads.

1004
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1005
00:45:00,546 --> 00:45:03,596 A:middle
This allows it to go ahead
and make requests early,

1006
00:45:03,806 --> 00:45:05,606 A:middle
so that a pre-roll is available

1007
00:45:05,696 --> 00:45:08,276 A:middle
when the user takes an
action that should show one.

1008
00:45:08,886 --> 00:45:10,536 A:middle
So to do that, we're
going to again go

1009
00:45:10,536 --> 00:45:15,176 A:middle
to our app delegate application
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions.

1010
00:45:15,176 --> 00:45:18,326 A:middle
We're going to go ahead
and import the iAd header

1011
00:45:18,726 --> 00:45:19,986 A:middle
and the media player header.

1012
00:45:20,466 --> 00:45:24,886 A:middle
This gives us access to both the
MP movie player controller class

1013
00:45:24,886 --> 00:45:29,276 A:middle
and the prepared pre-roll ads
category that iAd adds to that.

1014
00:45:29,276 --> 00:45:32,136 A:middle
So inside
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions,

1015
00:45:32,136 --> 00:45:37,026 A:middle
we're just going to call MP
movie player controller prepare

1016
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:39,376 A:middle
pre-roll adds, and that
kicks off the ad requests

1017
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:41,686 A:middle
so that we can have a pre-roll
ready when the user taps

1018
00:45:41,686 --> 00:45:42,806 A:middle
on one of our thumbnails.

1019
00:45:43,516 --> 00:45:47,656 A:middle
Speaking of that, we next need
to take care of actually doing

1020
00:45:47,656 --> 00:45:49,676 A:middle
that when the user taps
on one of the thumbnails.

1021
00:45:49,716 --> 00:45:52,686 A:middle
So to do that, we're going
to go to our view controller.

1022
00:45:52,686 --> 00:45:54,996 A:middle
We're going to go back up to
the top first, and we're going

1023
00:45:54,996 --> 00:45:58,216 A:middle
to import the iAd
header here as well.

1024
00:45:58,216 --> 00:46:00,436 A:middle
We've already imported
the media player framework

1025
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1026
00:46:00,436 --> 00:46:02,026 A:middle
since we're playing the videos.

1027
00:46:02,586 --> 00:46:04,256 A:middle
And then we're going to go down
to the bottom and we're going

1028
00:46:04,256 --> 00:46:04,476 A:middle
to go

1029
00:46:04,476 --> 00:46:07,676 A:middle
to our collectionViewdidSelect
ItemAtIndexPath.

1030
00:46:07,746 --> 00:46:12,476 A:middle
This is where we handled that
tap and begin playing the movie.

1031
00:46:13,086 --> 00:46:16,476 A:middle
All we're doing at the moment is
instantiating an MP movie player

1032
00:46:16,476 --> 00:46:18,926 A:middle
view controller and
setting the content URL,

1033
00:46:19,306 --> 00:46:20,326 A:middle
and then presenting it.

1034
00:46:21,006 --> 00:46:24,806 A:middle
The only change we need to
make here is to insert a call

1035
00:46:24,806 --> 00:46:27,556 A:middle
to play pre-roll ad
with completion handler.

1036
00:46:28,166 --> 00:46:31,896 A:middle
A note that we're calling MPV
controller movie player play

1037
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:33,826 A:middle
inside the completion handler.

1038
00:46:33,826 --> 00:46:37,206 A:middle
So once the pre-roll has
finished or has failed to play,

1039
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:39,436 A:middle
we'll go ahead and
play our content.

1040
00:46:40,376 --> 00:46:44,666 A:middle
Once we've done that, we can
go ahead and run this again.

1041
00:46:48,196 --> 00:46:50,436 A:middle
We've launched application.

1042
00:46:50,436 --> 00:46:52,006 A:middle
You see we've changed
almost nothing here.

1043
00:46:52,006 --> 00:46:54,276 A:middle
We still got our
collection of videos.

1044
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:57,696 A:middle
And this time when the user
taps on one of these videos,

1045
00:46:57,726 --> 00:47:00,706 A:middle
if an ad is available, a
pre-roll should play before it.

1046
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1047
00:47:01,936 --> 00:47:02,656 A:middle
And here we go.

1048
00:47:02,656 --> 00:47:06,056 A:middle
We've got these are tapped,
we've got the ad coming up,

1049
00:47:06,146 --> 00:47:10,346 A:middle
the ad is playing, a few seconds
later, the user will be able

1050
00:47:10,346 --> 00:47:13,766 A:middle
to either watch this ad to
completion or skip through.

1051
00:47:14,356 --> 00:47:15,416 A:middle
And when that finishes,

1052
00:47:15,846 --> 00:47:17,306 A:middle
the video immediately
begins playing.

1053
00:47:18,816 --> 00:47:21,216 A:middle
And that's all it takes
to integrate pre-rolls

1054
00:47:21,216 --> 00:47:22,106 A:middle
into your application.

1055
00:47:22,296 --> 00:47:24,366 A:middle
With that, I'll bring
Nathan back up.

1056
00:47:24,366 --> 00:47:25,536 A:middle
>> Nathan de Vries:
So as you can see,

1057
00:47:25,536 --> 00:47:28,046 A:middle
if you've already got a
movie player application,

1058
00:47:28,046 --> 00:47:31,446 A:middle
it's very easy to port it
across the playing pre-roll ads.

1059
00:47:32,006 --> 00:47:33,326 A:middle
If you don't, then
it's very easy

1060
00:47:33,326 --> 00:47:35,146 A:middle
to add these experiences
to your app.

1061
00:47:35,536 --> 00:47:36,976 A:middle
So wrapping up a little bit,

1062
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:41,446 A:middle
we have these brand new
pre-roll ads available in iOS 7.

1063
00:47:41,576 --> 00:47:44,346 A:middle
Some great new opportunities
for video apps

1064
00:47:44,346 --> 00:47:46,526 A:middle
to produce more revenue

1065
00:47:46,576 --> 00:47:48,476 A:middle
from their application
with pre-roll ads.

1066
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:51,656 A:middle
We have those medium rectangle
ads that are supported

1067
00:47:51,656 --> 00:47:54,656 A:middle
on the iPad that can
be positioned in-line

1068
00:47:54,656 --> 00:47:57,636 A:middle
with your content for a
more integrated experience.

1069
00:47:58,516 --> 00:48:01,446 A:middle
We have new interstitial
support for iPhone,

1070
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1071
00:48:01,776 --> 00:48:03,966 A:middle
which is new in iOS 7.

1072
00:48:04,176 --> 00:48:07,386 A:middle
They're also supported on iPad.

1073
00:48:07,386 --> 00:48:11,976 A:middle
And lastly we have these new
banner controller API's similar

1074
00:48:11,976 --> 00:48:14,016 A:middle
to the interstitial
API's that allow you

1075
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:17,506 A:middle
to simply toggle a switch on
your view controllers to opt

1076
00:48:17,506 --> 00:48:20,256 A:middle
in to advertising for
those content views.

1077
00:48:21,236 --> 00:48:22,916 A:middle
And lastly, we spoke
a little bit

1078
00:48:22,916 --> 00:48:26,656 A:middle
about optimizing your ad
performance, so when you go away

1079
00:48:26,656 --> 00:48:30,476 A:middle
and you're thinking about
integrating these advertisements

1080
00:48:30,476 --> 00:48:33,426 A:middle
into your application,
think back to these tips

1081
00:48:33,426 --> 00:48:36,516 A:middle
for optimizing ad performance,
placing ads smartly,

1082
00:48:36,936 --> 00:48:39,336 A:middle
looking at specific
regions and locales

1083
00:48:39,336 --> 00:48:42,546 A:middle
for the way you might want
to optimize your marketing,

1084
00:48:42,976 --> 00:48:46,106 A:middle
and lastly, make sure that
it all starts with the app.

1085
00:48:46,486 --> 00:48:48,676 A:middle
Really focus on pleasing
your customers

1086
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,656 A:middle
and you'll generate far more
revenue from your applications.

1087
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:52,466 A:middle
Thank you.

1088
00:48:53,666 --> 00:48:58,006 A:middle
For more information
about these slides

1089
00:48:58,006 --> 00:49:02,056 A:middle
and iAd-related questions, you
should speak to our director

1090
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1091
00:49:02,056 --> 00:49:04,876 A:middle
of technology evangelism,
John, or you should jump

1092
00:49:04,876 --> 00:49:07,186 A:middle
onto the forums and
ask questions there.

1093
00:49:07,276 --> 00:49:09,636 A:middle
We have a whole bunch of
us that answer questions.

1094
00:49:10,026 --> 00:49:12,196 A:middle
To develop documentation
as I mentioned is part

1095
00:49:12,196 --> 00:49:13,266 A:middle
of the developed benefits.

1096
00:49:13,266 --> 00:49:14,846 A:middle
Is incredibly thorough.

1097
00:49:15,406 --> 00:49:18,636 A:middle
So there's the iAd Sample Suite
that you want to check out,

1098
00:49:18,636 --> 00:49:21,116 A:middle
and also the new
develop a documentation

1099
00:49:21,116 --> 00:49:23,596 A:middle
for these new API's that
we're launching this release.

1100
00:49:24,436 --> 00:49:27,616 A:middle
There's some related sessions if
you're interested in promotion

1101
00:49:27,616 --> 00:49:30,716 A:middle
of your application, as
well as making revenue

1102
00:49:30,716 --> 00:49:32,106 A:middle
from your application.

1103
00:49:32,276 --> 00:49:35,886 A:middle
You should check out the videos
of the iAd workbench session.

1104
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:38,816 A:middle
And if you're interested
in content creation

1105
00:49:38,816 --> 00:49:42,886 A:middle
for advertising, then there's
also two sessions related

1106
00:49:42,886 --> 00:49:45,056 A:middle
to producing the ads themselves.

1107
00:49:45,476 --> 00:49:46,556 A:middle
Thank you very much.
