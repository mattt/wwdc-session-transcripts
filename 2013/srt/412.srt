3
00:00:14,596 --> 00:00:15,356 A:middle
>> Good afternoon everyone.

4
00:00:15,946 --> 00:00:19,216 A:middle
Welcome to Continuous
Integration in Xcode 5.

5
00:00:20,036 --> 00:00:21,316 A:middle
My name is Andrew Nesbitt.

6
00:00:21,436 --> 00:00:22,816 A:middle
I am the engineering manager

7
00:00:22,816 --> 00:00:24,996 A:middle
on the OS X Server
part of this feature.

8
00:00:28,026 --> 00:00:30,246 A:middle
So as you heard in
yesterday's platform kick off,

9
00:00:30,286 --> 00:00:34,846 A:middle
the theme for Xcode 5
is building better apps.

10
00:00:34,846 --> 00:00:37,266 A:middle
And Xcode 5 is packed, full
of amazing new features

11
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:38,426 A:middle
to help you share this goal.

12
00:00:38,476 --> 00:00:41,636 A:middle
In this afternoon, we're going
to spend our time looking at one

13
00:00:41,636 --> 00:00:43,766 A:middle
of those new features in
particular and that is

14
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:45,456 A:middle
of course Continuous
Integration.

15
00:00:46,076 --> 00:00:48,216 A:middle
And hopefully you will learn
how you can use Continuous

16
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:50,356 A:middle
Integration to build
better apps.

17
00:00:50,896 --> 00:00:55,446 A:middle
So the lineup for this
afternoon is that we will start

18
00:00:55,446 --> 00:00:57,736 A:middle
out with a little bit of a
terminology refresh of the some

19
00:00:57,736 --> 00:00:59,796 A:middle
of the key Xcode terms
that we need to know.

20
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:02,366 A:middle
And after that we'll
dig right in.

21
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

22
00:01:02,516 --> 00:01:04,726 A:middle
We'll start exploring the
Xcode Service and we'll talk

23
00:01:04,726 --> 00:01:06,886 A:middle
for a while about
configuring OS X Server

24
00:01:06,886 --> 00:01:08,106 A:middle
for Continuous Integration.

25
00:01:08,396 --> 00:01:11,376 A:middle
After that we'll do a
deep dive into Xcode 5

26
00:01:11,376 --> 00:01:13,406 A:middle
and the band new bots
feature that we have.

27
00:01:13,546 --> 00:01:16,856 A:middle
And then we'll spend some time
looking at the web application

28
00:01:17,096 --> 00:01:18,636 A:middle
and the feature that
we call Scoreboard.

29
00:01:19,526 --> 00:01:21,536 A:middle
And after that we'll finish
with some best practices

30
00:01:21,536 --> 00:01:24,796 A:middle
that we have learned inside
Apple for deploying the service.

31
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:29,486 A:middle
So the big question is why
use Continuous Integration?

32
00:01:30,366 --> 00:01:33,926 A:middle
Over the years, through
many iOS and OS X releases,

33
00:01:34,496 --> 00:01:36,966 A:middle
we have given you an enormous
toolbox of features to use.

34
00:01:36,966 --> 00:01:38,606 A:middle
And you guys have definitely
arisen to the challenge

35
00:01:38,606 --> 00:01:40,106 A:middle
by shipping amazing
applications.

36
00:01:41,186 --> 00:01:44,076 A:middle
And of course, shipping
amazing applications we all know

37
00:01:44,076 --> 00:01:45,016 A:middle
requires testing.

38
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:49,216 A:middle
And as the number of OS versions
that you target and the types

39
00:01:49,216 --> 00:01:52,076 A:middle
of devices that you target
skill it becomes more

40
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:54,326 A:middle
and more difficult to test
your applications well.

41
00:01:54,326 --> 00:01:56,456 A:middle
And this is where Continuous
Integration comes into play.

42
00:01:58,446 --> 00:02:00,726 A:middle
Continuous Integration will
give you the opportunity

43
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

44
00:02:00,726 --> 00:02:02,796 A:middle
to do testing on
multiple OS versions

45
00:02:02,796 --> 00:02:04,576 A:middle
and multiple hardware models.

46
00:02:06,016 --> 00:02:07,946 A:middle
Of course, once you have
a server in the mix,

47
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:10,526 A:middle
you're now in the
position to build, analyze

48
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:12,356 A:middle
and test your project often.

49
00:02:13,646 --> 00:02:15,906 A:middle
And of course, having a server
will give you the opportunity

50
00:02:15,906 --> 00:02:19,686 A:middle
to catch problems quickly and
this is the key automatically.

51
00:02:22,146 --> 00:02:24,576 A:middle
Many of you have more than
one Mac and I'm sure a lot

52
00:02:24,576 --> 00:02:26,756 A:middle
of you have a Mac sitting in
your office doing nothing.

53
00:02:27,586 --> 00:02:30,626 A:middle
And this is a great opportunity
to put that Mac back to work.

54
00:02:30,826 --> 00:02:33,236 A:middle
Let the server do the
heavy-lifting of building your--

55
00:02:33,406 --> 00:02:34,816 A:middle
building your project
automatically.

56
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:38,016 A:middle
And having a server lets you
do things that you can't do

57
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:40,166 A:middle
in Xcode or that you
can't do in Xcode feasibly

58
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,436 A:middle
and the big thing here is
the ability to gather, build,

59
00:02:42,436 --> 00:02:45,226 A:middle
and test history for
your project over time.

60
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:49,356 A:middle
And, of course, having a server

61
00:02:49,356 --> 00:02:52,126 A:middle
in the mix gives you an awesome
new way to distribute builds

62
00:02:52,126 --> 00:02:54,206 A:middle
to your team and I see some
examples about coming up.

63
00:02:55,456 --> 00:02:57,976 A:middle
So to get started, let's
talk for a little second

64
00:02:57,976 --> 00:02:59,886 A:middle
about some terminology that
you're going to need to know.

65
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

66
00:03:00,896 --> 00:03:02,496 A:middle
There are three key terms.

67
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,186 A:middle
Number one is that of a scheme.

68
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:08,576 A:middle
And a scheme is a very simple
concept; it's just a recipe

69
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:10,066 A:middle
for building your project.

70
00:03:10,696 --> 00:03:13,176 A:middle
A scheme defines what
targets you're going to build,

71
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,706 A:middle
what dependent targets
you're going to get built,

72
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:17,446 A:middle
and also what build
settings will be pass

73
00:03:17,446 --> 00:03:18,596 A:middle
when those targets do get built.

74
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:22,236 A:middle
And because we're dealing with
the server, a server needs

75
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:24,146 A:middle
to have access to this
scheme information.

76
00:03:24,286 --> 00:03:25,906 A:middle
And schemes are typically
personal things,

77
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,676 A:middle
I'm sure you all have a
bunch of schemes that you set

78
00:03:27,676 --> 00:03:28,736 A:middle
up just the way you like them.

79
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:32,326 A:middle
But we're going to use a little
extended version of the scheme

80
00:03:32,326 --> 00:03:34,136 A:middle
and that is of a shared scheme.

81
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,146 A:middle
And a shared scheme is
nothing more than a scheme

82
00:03:36,146 --> 00:03:38,466 A:middle
that has been checked in to your
source controller repository

83
00:03:38,806 --> 00:03:40,486 A:middle
and shared with the
rest of your team.

84
00:03:40,696 --> 00:03:43,046 A:middle
So that's item number one.

85
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:45,596 A:middle
Number two is that of a bot.

86
00:03:46,396 --> 00:03:50,946 A:middle
And a bot is a configuration
for analyzing, building, testing

87
00:03:50,946 --> 00:03:53,416 A:middle
and archiving your
project on a schedule.

88
00:03:53,486 --> 00:03:54,966 A:middle
And we'll come back to
this guy in a second.

89
00:03:56,526 --> 00:03:59,316 A:middle
The third item of terminology
is that of an integration.

90
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:01,966 A:middle
And an integration is just
a single run of a bot.

91
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

92
00:04:02,236 --> 00:04:04,176 A:middle
So every time your bot
runs, your bot is said

93
00:04:04,176 --> 00:04:06,866 A:middle
to be performing an integration
or it is integrating.

94
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,456 A:middle
So let's look at a little bit
more detail of surrounding bots.

95
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:16,666 A:middle
So like I said, a bot
is a configuration

96
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:17,685 A:middle
for building your project.

97
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,736 A:middle
A bot defines what
we're going to build.

98
00:04:22,176 --> 00:04:23,236 A:middle
So there are two things here.

99
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,346 A:middle
Firstly, it defines where
the source code lives

100
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:27,256 A:middle
that we are going to build.

101
00:04:27,636 --> 00:04:29,406 A:middle
So what repository that
source code lives in?

102
00:04:29,406 --> 00:04:31,086 A:middle
How are we going to
access that repository

103
00:04:31,086 --> 00:04:32,066 A:middle
to get that source code?

104
00:04:33,246 --> 00:04:36,176 A:middle
And secondly, the project
or the workspace inside

105
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:38,726 A:middle
that SCM location that
we're going to access

106
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:39,926 A:middle
where that project lives?

107
00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:45,646 A:middle
Secondly, a bot defines when
we're going to build it.

108
00:04:46,026 --> 00:04:48,766 A:middle
So we have some great scheduling
options in the Xcode Service.

109
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:53,546 A:middle
We have periodic options so you
can build your project hourly,

110
00:04:53,846 --> 00:04:57,536 A:middle
daily at a time or weekly on a
day at a time of your chosen.

111
00:04:58,696 --> 00:04:59,946 A:middle
We have on-commit options.

112
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:02,676 A:middle
So you can build when your
source repository changes

113
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

114
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:03,806 A:middle
and you can tell the server

115
00:05:03,806 --> 00:05:05,826 A:middle
when your source repository
changes by a heap script.

116
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:08,376 A:middle
Or you can have the
server periodically checked

117
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:10,926 A:middle
with your SCM server when
your source code is available,

118
00:05:11,296 --> 00:05:12,276 A:middle
otherwise known as pulling.

119
00:05:13,116 --> 00:05:14,386 A:middle
And of course there's manual.

120
00:05:14,386 --> 00:05:16,266 A:middle
So you will-- this will
be you will run the bot

121
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:17,406 A:middle
when you feel like
running the bot.

122
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,816 A:middle
The third slice of the
bot configuration is

123
00:05:20,816 --> 00:05:22,676 A:middle
that of how we're going
to build your project.

124
00:05:24,076 --> 00:05:26,916 A:middle
And this is composed of the
shared scheme information

125
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,616 A:middle
that you've defined
when you set up the bot,

126
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:30,696 A:middle
which scheme you'd
like us to use.

127
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:33,606 A:middle
And then some options, we have
some action options available

128
00:05:33,606 --> 00:05:34,126 A:middle
for your bot.

129
00:05:34,296 --> 00:05:36,926 A:middle
So you can choose whether or
not you would like your bot

130
00:05:36,926 --> 00:05:40,076 A:middle
to perform static analysis,
whether or not you would

131
00:05:40,076 --> 00:05:41,886 A:middle
like your bot to
perform testing.

132
00:05:41,996 --> 00:05:46,616 A:middle
And if you are performing
testing, which devices

133
00:05:46,616 --> 00:05:48,096 A:middle
on which you would like
to perform testing.

134
00:05:48,096 --> 00:05:51,356 A:middle
And we support bot testing on
the Mac which is the server.

135
00:05:51,896 --> 00:05:54,386 A:middle
We support testing on
simulators, we support testing

136
00:05:54,386 --> 00:05:57,296 A:middle
on a single device, we support
testing on multiple devices

137
00:05:57,716 --> 00:05:59,726 A:middle
or any other combinations
of those settings.

138
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

139
00:06:00,616 --> 00:06:01,526 A:middle
Where that makes sense?

140
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:02,716 A:middle
Of course.

141
00:06:02,816 --> 00:06:06,716 A:middle
And lastly, your bot can define
whether or not you would like us

142
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:07,646 A:middle
to produce an archive.

143
00:06:07,646 --> 00:06:12,026 A:middle
And an archive will produce both
a package and an .xcarchive file

144
00:06:12,026 --> 00:06:13,846 A:middle
for a Mac project or an IPA

145
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:16,086 A:middle
on an .xcarchive file
for an iOS project.

146
00:06:17,926 --> 00:06:20,126 A:middle
We also have some great
notification settings

147
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:21,106 A:middle
for the Xcode Service.

148
00:06:21,106 --> 00:06:23,166 A:middle
So when you set up a bot,
you got a couple of options.

149
00:06:24,026 --> 00:06:28,496 A:middle
So we let you notify people, we
have checked in code to that bot

150
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:30,956 A:middle
so all the source controls
submissions that have been made

151
00:06:30,956 --> 00:06:34,866 A:middle
since that bot last run, all
those people can get notified

152
00:06:34,866 --> 00:06:36,566 A:middle
and you can choose whether
to notify those people

153
00:06:36,926 --> 00:06:38,936 A:middle
when the bot is successful
or when the bot fails.

154
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:42,946 A:middle
And you can also define
lists of e-mail addresses

155
00:06:42,946 --> 00:06:44,506 A:middle
for people you would
like to e-mail

156
00:06:44,506 --> 00:06:45,436 A:middle
on those conditions as well.

157
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:51,016 A:middle
So the Xcode story can
really be thought of--

158
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:53,466 A:middle
the Xcode Service story can be
thought off in two parts here.

159
00:06:53,586 --> 00:06:55,616 A:middle
So there is OS X Server

160
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:57,806 A:middle
and we have an amazing
preview releasable OX X Server,

161
00:06:57,806 --> 00:07:00,746 A:middle
and of course there's Xcode 5.

162
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

163
00:07:00,996 --> 00:07:02,886 A:middle
So let's start by digging

164
00:07:02,886 --> 00:07:05,956 A:middle
in to the OS X Server
part of the story first.

165
00:07:08,006 --> 00:07:09,896 A:middle
So in the Mountain
Lion timeframe,

166
00:07:10,046 --> 00:07:12,086 A:middle
we made server an application.

167
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:15,036 A:middle
No longer a server, an entirely
separate operating system

168
00:07:15,036 --> 00:07:18,676 A:middle
that you have to set up, Server
is just an app that you purchase

169
00:07:18,756 --> 00:07:21,116 A:middle
and download and install
from the Mac App Store.

170
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:24,026 A:middle
And it's never been simpler to
turn your Mac into a server.

171
00:07:24,216 --> 00:07:29,406 A:middle
And carrying on this theme of
simplicity in the next version

172
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:31,206 A:middle
of Server the pre-release
that we have available.

173
00:07:32,216 --> 00:07:33,326 A:middle
We have some great new features.

174
00:07:33,326 --> 00:07:34,826 A:middle
And one of those
is simple setup.

175
00:07:35,406 --> 00:07:38,196 A:middle
Simple setup takes out all
the complexities setting

176
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:38,836 A:middle
up your server.

177
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:41,426 A:middle
No longer will you be asked a
bunch of complicated questions

178
00:07:41,426 --> 00:07:44,546 A:middle
about networking configurations
or Apple ID configurations,

179
00:07:44,886 --> 00:07:45,826 A:middle
you're asked one question

180
00:07:45,826 --> 00:07:47,636 A:middle
that is an administrator
user name and password.

181
00:07:47,736 --> 00:07:50,106 A:middle
And once you've entered that
credential, the Server is

182
00:07:50,106 --> 00:07:51,656 A:middle
up to the races setting
itself up

183
00:07:51,656 --> 00:07:53,346 A:middle
and within seconds you
have a server available

184
00:07:53,346 --> 00:07:56,976 A:middle
and ready to be used.

185
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,696 A:middle
We also have some
brand new UI in server.

186
00:07:59,826 --> 00:08:01,586 A:middle
Server looks great,
it's never look better

187
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

188
00:08:01,586 --> 00:08:03,926 A:middle
and we're actually servicing
some really useful information

189
00:08:03,926 --> 00:08:05,736 A:middle
that we find that people
really, really want.

190
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:08,326 A:middle
Like how your service
is behaving,

191
00:08:08,636 --> 00:08:09,916 A:middle
how to access your service

192
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,306 A:middle
and whether your
service is on or off.

193
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,456 A:middle
So as an example, let's
dig in to what it takes

194
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:17,066 A:middle
to set up an OS X Server.

195
00:08:19,116 --> 00:08:21,396 A:middle
So when you launch OS X
Server, you'll see this.

196
00:08:21,396 --> 00:08:23,246 A:middle
And this is the Welcome
menu for the application.

197
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:26,236 A:middle
And when you click
Continue, you'll be asked

198
00:08:26,236 --> 00:08:27,486 A:middle
for a user name and password.

199
00:08:29,136 --> 00:08:31,196 A:middle
And once you type those
guys in, the Server goes off

200
00:08:31,196 --> 00:08:35,405 A:middle
and starts doing its thing.

201
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,775 A:middle
And very quickly you're launched

202
00:08:36,775 --> 00:08:38,645 A:middle
into the OS X Server
application.

203
00:08:39,765 --> 00:08:42,186 A:middle
And in the left you'll
see all the services

204
00:08:42,186 --> 00:08:44,066 A:middle
that the OS X Server
application supports.

205
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,396 A:middle
And on the right, you'll
see the detailed view

206
00:08:45,396 --> 00:08:46,136 A:middle
for those services.

207
00:08:46,266 --> 00:08:50,956 A:middle
So before we go any further,
you're probably all wondering

208
00:08:50,956 --> 00:08:52,466 A:middle
about the thing that
you're here--

209
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:55,646 A:middle
you're here to hear about
which is the Xcode Service.

210
00:08:58,486 --> 00:09:00,476 A:middle
The Xcode Service
when it's turned

211
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

212
00:09:00,476 --> 00:09:03,046 A:middle
on in OS X Server will
start advertising itself

213
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:05,396 A:middle
across your network and it
uses Bonjour to do that.

214
00:09:05,956 --> 00:09:08,666 A:middle
So any Xcode 5 user
that's sitting

215
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,946 A:middle
within your network will see
servers that are available--

216
00:09:10,946 --> 00:09:13,026 A:middle
that have been available, made
available in your network.

217
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:18,466 A:middle
Once the service is turned on,
it's super simple to create

218
00:09:18,546 --> 00:09:22,626 A:middle
and manage bots that build
both Mac and iOS projects.

219
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:25,286 A:middle
And if you're a little bit
fuzzy about Access settings,

220
00:09:26,036 --> 00:09:27,956 A:middle
we do have some great ways
to configure that too.

221
00:09:29,556 --> 00:09:31,306 A:middle
You can define both who
you would like to be able

222
00:09:31,306 --> 00:09:34,026 A:middle
to create bots on your
server and also who you would

223
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:35,996 A:middle
like to be able to view
bots on your server.

224
00:09:35,996 --> 00:09:37,796 A:middle
And you can set this up in
whatever way that you like,

225
00:09:37,886 --> 00:09:41,856 A:middle
whatever way that makes
sense for your team.

226
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:44,216 A:middle
We also have some really,
really great integration

227
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,446 A:middle
with the Apple Developer
Program.

228
00:09:45,646 --> 00:09:47,736 A:middle
And this means that you
can join your Server

229
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:49,776 A:middle
to your existing
Apple Developer team.

230
00:09:50,706 --> 00:09:53,086 A:middle
And the question might be well
why I would I want to do that?

231
00:09:53,086 --> 00:09:56,056 A:middle
And the answer is when your
Server joins your team,

232
00:09:56,056 --> 00:09:59,256 A:middle
your Server has the opportunity
to request its own Mac

233
00:09:59,256 --> 00:10:02,506 A:middle
and iOS signing identities
and also download all

234
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

235
00:10:02,506 --> 00:10:03,686 A:middle
of the team provisioning
profiles

236
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,756 A:middle
that exist for your team.

237
00:10:04,906 --> 00:10:06,976 A:middle
And this puts us in
a great position.

238
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,726 A:middle
And this brings me on to my
next point which is devices.

239
00:10:10,386 --> 00:10:13,226 A:middle
OS X Server has great
support for devices for bots.

240
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:15,856 A:middle
So once your server is a
member of a developer team,

241
00:10:16,136 --> 00:10:17,886 A:middle
you'll see devices
in OS X Server.

242
00:10:19,406 --> 00:10:21,976 A:middle
You can easily add and
remove devices both to

243
00:10:21,976 --> 00:10:24,966 A:middle
and from your team and of
course once you've done that,

244
00:10:25,086 --> 00:10:27,116 A:middle
those devices become
available when people set

245
00:10:27,116 --> 00:10:29,686 A:middle
up bots using Xcode 5
against your Server.

246
00:10:29,686 --> 00:10:35,156 A:middle
Another feature that we've been
asked for a lot in OS X Server

247
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:38,196 A:middle
for the last couple of years
is source control hosting

248
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:39,806 A:middle
and we are adding
this feature too.

249
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:43,326 A:middle
So, OS X Server will support
Hosted Git repositories

250
00:10:43,536 --> 00:10:45,516 A:middle
and once they're set up
with just a few clicks,

251
00:10:45,516 --> 00:10:47,596 A:middle
you'll have a Hosted Git
repository that's accessible

252
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:49,276 A:middle
by SSH, HTTP or HTTPS.

253
00:10:49,276 --> 00:10:51,546 A:middle
And equally you can lock

254
00:10:51,546 --> 00:10:53,846 A:middle
that repository done just
the way you like it to.

255
00:10:54,516 --> 00:11:00,946 A:middle
[ Applause ]

256
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

257
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:03,806 A:middle
And of course, if you're
not ready to make the move

258
00:11:03,806 --> 00:11:05,886 A:middle
to hosting your source code
in an OS X Server just yet

259
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:08,436 A:middle
or you're using an external
source control system

260
00:11:08,436 --> 00:11:12,746 A:middle
like your hub, then OS X Server
will equally well connect

261
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:13,776 A:middle
to those repositories too.

262
00:11:13,776 --> 00:11:16,586 A:middle
So, we can connect to remote
SVN and remote Git repositories

263
00:11:17,196 --> 00:11:19,586 A:middle
and we can connect to those
repositories anonymously

264
00:11:19,756 --> 00:11:21,906 A:middle
with username and
password or with public,

265
00:11:21,906 --> 00:11:23,636 A:middle
private SSH key pair
authentication.

266
00:11:23,886 --> 00:11:25,216 A:middle
And it's really easy
to set that up too.

267
00:11:25,446 --> 00:11:29,246 A:middle
So, as an example, let me take
you through what it takes to set

268
00:11:29,246 --> 00:11:31,666 A:middle
up the Xcode Service
in OS X Server.

269
00:11:35,306 --> 00:11:37,416 A:middle
So, when you go the Xcode
Service you see this,

270
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,136 A:middle
and this is the Xcode
Service panel

271
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:40,916 A:middle
and it's split into two parts.

272
00:11:41,006 --> 00:11:43,226 A:middle
On the left is everything
to do with bots

273
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:45,756 A:middle
and configuring your
service and on the right,

274
00:11:45,936 --> 00:11:48,936 A:middle
the second tab is everything
to do with hosted repositories

275
00:11:49,256 --> 00:11:51,816 A:middle
and remote repositories that
your server can connect to.

276
00:11:52,686 --> 00:11:55,276 A:middle
So, let's say we want to add our
server to our development team,

277
00:11:55,276 --> 00:11:56,246 A:middle
what does it take to do that?

278
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:57,546 A:middle
And it's really easy.

279
00:11:58,266 --> 00:12:00,166 A:middle
So, to do that, we click
the Add button right here

280
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

281
00:12:01,506 --> 00:12:03,496 A:middle
and we'll be asked for
username and password.

282
00:12:03,576 --> 00:12:07,796 A:middle
And the Server will go wide
to the Apple Developer Program

283
00:12:07,796 --> 00:12:10,266 A:middle
and figure out which teams
this Apple ID is a member of.

284
00:12:10,326 --> 00:12:12,846 A:middle
And because I am just a
member of one team right now,

285
00:12:12,846 --> 00:12:13,986 A:middle
I'm getting this
sheet which says,

286
00:12:13,986 --> 00:12:15,146 A:middle
"It looks like you're
a member of a team,

287
00:12:15,146 --> 00:12:16,846 A:middle
would you like to join
your server to this team?"

288
00:12:17,076 --> 00:12:18,946 A:middle
But if you're a member
of multiple teams,

289
00:12:19,426 --> 00:12:21,696 A:middle
let's say you're a contractor
then you'll get a list

290
00:12:21,696 --> 00:12:22,966 A:middle
of all the teams that
you're a member of

291
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:26,036 A:middle
and you can join your server
to one or all of those teams.

292
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:30,666 A:middle
You can have as many teams as
you like with the OS X Server.

293
00:12:30,746 --> 00:12:33,346 A:middle
Once you've added your team,
your server will set itself up

294
00:12:33,506 --> 00:12:35,206 A:middle
and you see that this
server is not a member

295
00:12:35,206 --> 00:12:36,126 A:middle
of that development team.

296
00:12:37,636 --> 00:12:39,876 A:middle
The next step of course
is adding some devices,

297
00:12:39,876 --> 00:12:41,166 A:middle
and once you plug in devices,

298
00:12:41,196 --> 00:12:43,556 A:middle
devices are able to
be used for bots.

299
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,476 A:middle
So, the server is
recognized here

300
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:47,756 A:middle
that this device does not
have a development that's set

301
00:12:47,756 --> 00:12:49,506 A:middle
and this device is
not actually enabled

302
00:12:49,506 --> 00:12:50,636 A:middle
for development for my team yet.

303
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,416 A:middle
So, I'm going to click on Use
for Development right here

304
00:12:53,176 --> 00:12:55,766 A:middle
and the server will
quickly and easily add

305
00:12:55,766 --> 00:12:56,676 A:middle
that device to my team.

306
00:12:56,806 --> 00:13:01,086 A:middle
And as an example, we do
support source control hosting

307
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

308
00:13:01,086 --> 00:13:03,896 A:middle
like I said and here's
what it takes to set

309
00:13:03,896 --> 00:13:05,676 A:middle
up some hosting repositories.

310
00:13:05,676 --> 00:13:07,496 A:middle
So we can either host
it or remote repository

311
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:09,956 A:middle
and you see some more of this
in our demo in a little second.

312
00:13:11,316 --> 00:13:14,726 A:middle
So, that is the OS X
Server part of the story

313
00:13:14,776 --> 00:13:17,896 A:middle
and of course there's the
Xcode 5 part and this is

314
00:13:17,896 --> 00:13:19,396 A:middle
where it gets really
exciting in my opinion.

315
00:13:21,056 --> 00:13:23,386 A:middle
Xcode 5 is an incredible
release.

316
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,766 A:middle
If you have not downloaded Xcode
5 yet, I suggest that you go

317
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:28,086 A:middle
and do so immediately,
it's really great.

318
00:13:29,466 --> 00:13:31,676 A:middle
And one of the nicest
features I think

319
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:33,906 A:middle
in Xcode 5 is the
Testing Edition

320
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:35,936 A:middle
and the new Continuous
Integration service.

321
00:13:35,986 --> 00:13:38,866 A:middle
So, as you go along with the
theme of Continuous Integration

322
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:40,786 A:middle
in Xcode 5, there are a
couple of things that I'd

323
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:41,786 A:middle
like to draw your attention to.

324
00:13:42,076 --> 00:13:45,386 A:middle
Firstly, we have some great
new kind of preferences.

325
00:13:45,386 --> 00:13:48,956 A:middle
So, it's really easy to add
an OS X Server to Xcode 5.

326
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,746 A:middle
You open the Preferences, type
in the username and password

327
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:54,176 A:middle
or choose guest if your
server administrator set it

328
00:13:54,176 --> 00:13:54,726 A:middle
up that way.

329
00:13:55,286 --> 00:13:59,996 A:middle
And you can quickly add
your server to your Xcode.

330
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

331
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:01,686 A:middle
Once you've done that, you're

332
00:14:01,686 --> 00:14:05,216 A:middle
in a position whereby you
can create bots for project

333
00:14:05,216 --> 00:14:09,206 A:middle
and workspaces that you
use in Xcode every day.

334
00:14:09,436 --> 00:14:11,856 A:middle
Once you create a bot, the bot
show up in the log navigator

335
00:14:12,076 --> 00:14:13,736 A:middle
and you see our beautiful
reports

336
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:15,326 A:middle
for Build and Test history.

337
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:18,476 A:middle
And these reports
are not just reports,

338
00:14:18,746 --> 00:14:21,356 A:middle
these are fully live
interactive reports

339
00:14:21,356 --> 00:14:23,056 A:middle
that have great assistant
editor support.

340
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:25,456 A:middle
So, you can select things
on the left in the report

341
00:14:25,456 --> 00:14:28,566 A:middle
and you'll see the source code
that caused that error issue

342
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:30,876 A:middle
or test failure right on the
right in the assistant editor.

343
00:14:31,026 --> 00:14:35,666 A:middle
And of course, this affords
you to dig in to your issues,

344
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,816 A:middle
or errors and you're
wondering to write

345
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:37,526 A:middle
where they're happening too.

346
00:14:37,526 --> 00:14:39,556 A:middle
So you see things going wrong
in a bot and you can play

347
00:14:39,556 --> 00:14:43,276 A:middle
with the source code and Xcode.

348
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:46,646 A:middle
We also have great multi-device
support in the Xcode Service

349
00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:49,116 A:middle
and we have some
really great UI in Xcode

350
00:14:49,116 --> 00:14:50,376 A:middle
for looking at those results.

351
00:14:50,996 --> 00:14:53,206 A:middle
You can see your
test results overtime

352
00:14:53,266 --> 00:14:55,136 A:middle
on across multiple
devices for your bot.

353
00:14:55,136 --> 00:14:59,616 A:middle
And for each integration
that happens

354
00:14:59,616 --> 00:15:02,436 A:middle
in the server you'll also see
full commit history for all

355
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

356
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:04,736 A:middle
of the commits that were
included in that build.

357
00:15:05,126 --> 00:15:07,866 A:middle
And you'll see all of the log
files that you're familiar

358
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,586 A:middle
within Xcode today be
produced on the server

359
00:15:09,586 --> 00:15:10,466 A:middle
and sent down to the client.

360
00:15:12,636 --> 00:15:14,696 A:middle
You have some great
ways to view download --

361
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:16,096 A:middle
view and download archives

362
00:15:16,096 --> 00:15:17,856 A:middle
of your project right
from within Xcode.

363
00:15:19,446 --> 00:15:22,656 A:middle
And we also have some really
nice source control integration

364
00:15:22,936 --> 00:15:24,456 A:middle
that you'll see in
our demo coming up.

365
00:15:24,656 --> 00:15:28,666 A:middle
So to do that, I would
like to invite Brent Shank

366
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:31,196 A:middle
who is a software
engineer on the Xcode team.

367
00:15:31,756 --> 00:15:34,356 A:middle
To come up here and show us the
Continuous Integration service.

368
00:15:35,516 --> 00:15:40,606 A:middle
[ Applause ]

369
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:41,926 A:middle
>> Thanks a lot, Andrew.

370
00:15:42,256 --> 00:15:44,296 A:middle
Well, I'm really excited
to be up here today,

371
00:15:44,656 --> 00:15:46,756 A:middle
not just because I had
five espressos this morning

372
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:48,076 A:middle
but because I love this stuff.

373
00:15:48,436 --> 00:15:50,106 A:middle
I love unit test and I loved it

374
00:15:50,106 --> 00:15:53,056 A:middle
for the first time this
Continuous Integration System

375
00:15:53,216 --> 00:15:54,556 A:middle
that just works.

376
00:15:54,556 --> 00:15:57,056 A:middle
I don't know about you but I
spend a lot of time dealing

377
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,516 A:middle
with some-- the other
systems that are out there.

378
00:15:59,356 --> 00:16:01,046 A:middle
And they're great but they
can be hard to set up,

379
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

380
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:04,146 A:middle
they can be hard to maintain,
what we've done is super easy

381
00:16:04,146 --> 00:16:05,696 A:middle
to set up, it's super powerful.

382
00:16:06,426 --> 00:16:08,106 A:middle
Let me show you what
it looks like in Xcode.

383
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,956 A:middle
So, the first thing
we have to do

384
00:16:09,956 --> 00:16:13,506 A:middle
to get Continuous Integration
working on Xcode is we have

385
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:16,296 A:middle
to tell Xcode about an OS
X Server that's running the

386
00:16:16,296 --> 00:16:18,116 A:middle
Continuous Integration
service, the Xcode Service.

387
00:16:19,116 --> 00:16:21,976 A:middle
I do that by adding an
account for an OS X Server.

388
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:25,396 A:middle
And as you've heard by
now, we have three types

389
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:26,416 A:middle
of accounts in Xcode 5.

390
00:16:26,836 --> 00:16:30,826 A:middle
There's one for your Apple ID
or Apple IDs, there's accounts

391
00:16:30,826 --> 00:16:32,076 A:middle
for source control repositories,

392
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,206 A:middle
and of course there are
accounts for OS X Servers.

393
00:16:34,816 --> 00:16:38,546 A:middle
And I access those through the
new Accounts preference pane.

394
00:16:39,686 --> 00:16:41,806 A:middle
Okay, well here's our beautiful
new Accounts preference pane,

395
00:16:41,806 --> 00:16:43,286 A:middle
you can see there, no
accounts right now.

396
00:16:43,706 --> 00:16:45,536 A:middle
It's really easy to add any
of those three account types.

397
00:16:45,946 --> 00:16:47,926 A:middle
I'm going to own account for
an OS X Server right now.

398
00:16:48,106 --> 00:16:49,816 A:middle
I click the Add Server button.

399
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:53,046 A:middle
And as Andrew said,
any server that's set

400
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:54,536 A:middle
up on your local
network is going

401
00:16:54,536 --> 00:16:57,116 A:middle
to be advertised via Bonjour
and you can add it that way.

402
00:16:57,386 --> 00:16:59,256 A:middle
You can also add a
server by host name or IP,

403
00:16:59,256 --> 00:17:00,826 A:middle
and that's really good
idea if you want to able

404
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

405
00:17:00,826 --> 00:17:01,946 A:middle
to access it from anywhere.

406
00:17:02,566 --> 00:17:04,215 A:middle
I'm going to select
this one on the list.

407
00:17:04,665 --> 00:17:09,106 A:middle
Click Next and authenticate
and here we go.

408
00:17:09,106 --> 00:17:10,915 A:middle
So, I've added an account for
server, it's really easy to do.

409
00:17:10,915 --> 00:17:12,906 A:middle
You can add as many
servers as you want,

410
00:17:13,096 --> 00:17:14,076 A:middle
OS X Servers that you want here.

411
00:17:14,455 --> 00:17:15,986 A:middle
So, what does this
enable me to do?

412
00:17:16,226 --> 00:17:19,476 A:middle
Well, we have some really tight
integration of source control

413
00:17:19,776 --> 00:17:21,685 A:middle
with the Xcode Service
and Xcode 5.

414
00:17:22,455 --> 00:17:24,296 A:middle
And part of where
we surface that is

415
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:25,776 A:middle
in the new checkout workflow.

416
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:28,646 A:middle
That's available in the
Source Control menu.

417
00:17:28,886 --> 00:17:31,276 A:middle
I go there now, and
I'll click Checkout.

418
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:33,576 A:middle
So, what's in this table here?

419
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,976 A:middle
Well, this is going to
show me a repository

420
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:39,446 A:middle
for every source control
account that I've added

421
00:17:39,446 --> 00:17:40,276 A:middle
in that preference pane.

422
00:17:40,756 --> 00:17:43,606 A:middle
It's also going to show me
any Hosted Git repository

423
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,586 A:middle
for an OS X Server that
I have an account for.

424
00:17:45,936 --> 00:17:48,336 A:middle
So as Andrew mentioned, this is
the new feature in OS X Server

425
00:17:48,336 --> 00:17:49,686 A:middle
that it can Host
Git repositories.

426
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,276 A:middle
And you can see here, these
are all repositories that are

427
00:17:52,276 --> 00:17:53,366 A:middle
on that server that I added.

428
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:56,256 A:middle
I'm going to select
BubbleGum, click Next,

429
00:17:57,316 --> 00:17:58,806 A:middle
it's going to authenticate
and checkout.

430
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:03,186 A:middle
So that's a really great way to
get source code for your team.

431
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

432
00:18:04,106 --> 00:18:05,956 A:middle
So, let's see what the state
of this project is like.

433
00:18:06,926 --> 00:18:11,156 A:middle
I'm going to build it, and
build failed because I need

434
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:12,076 A:middle
to switch to the simulator.

435
00:18:12,076 --> 00:18:13,356 A:middle
I'll do that now.

436
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:15,906 A:middle
The build succeeded,
this is great,

437
00:18:16,236 --> 00:18:17,136 A:middle
let's see how the tests look.

438
00:18:18,036 --> 00:18:21,326 A:middle
I'll run unit tests,
the simulator launches,

439
00:18:21,426 --> 00:18:25,926 A:middle
the test are going to run,
and will they succeed?

440
00:18:25,926 --> 00:18:26,676 A:middle
They didn't, they failed.

441
00:18:26,676 --> 00:18:28,126 A:middle
Well, this is good, this
is what I wanted to happen.

442
00:18:28,946 --> 00:18:30,686 A:middle
Well, how can we use
Continuous Integration

443
00:18:30,686 --> 00:18:32,296 A:middle
to figure out what went wrong?

444
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:34,736 A:middle
So I just checked out this
project from source control,

445
00:18:34,736 --> 00:18:35,846 A:middle
I didn't make any changes.

446
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:39,066 A:middle
So, this means someone else
broke this test somehow.

447
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:43,746 A:middle
So, let's use Continuous
Integration in bots

448
00:18:43,746 --> 00:18:44,966 A:middle
to figure out what went wrong.

449
00:18:45,786 --> 00:18:48,206 A:middle
So, we surfaced bots
from the log navigator.

450
00:18:48,846 --> 00:18:50,206 A:middle
And you can see there
a couple of things here

451
00:18:50,206 --> 00:18:52,926 A:middle
that you haven't seen
before in Xcode; Bubblegum

452
00:18:52,926 --> 00:18:54,936 A:middle
and Bubblegum Nightly
are both bots.

453
00:18:55,556 --> 00:18:57,936 A:middle
You can set up as many bots
as you want for projects,

454
00:18:57,996 --> 00:18:58,786 A:middle
it's really easy to do.

455
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,426 A:middle
I'm going to show you
the bot for Bubblegum.

456
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

457
00:19:02,426 --> 00:19:03,146 A:middle
I'll click on that here.

458
00:19:04,216 --> 00:19:05,426 A:middle
So, this is the bot report.

459
00:19:06,506 --> 00:19:09,656 A:middle
You can see it's really
clean, it's really beautiful

460
00:19:09,696 --> 00:19:11,746 A:middle
and provides a lot
of great information.

461
00:19:12,616 --> 00:19:15,586 A:middle
So, let's go from
top to bottom here.

462
00:19:15,586 --> 00:19:18,056 A:middle
At the top here, any time you
want to run an integration,

463
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:18,886 A:middle
you just click Integrate Now.

464
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:19,546 A:middle
No problem.

465
00:19:19,546 --> 00:19:21,546 A:middle
Usually, bots run out of
schedule, you configure them

466
00:19:21,546 --> 00:19:23,346 A:middle
to run manually,
whatever you want,

467
00:19:23,346 --> 00:19:25,266 A:middle
whenever you want integration,
just click that button.

468
00:19:26,046 --> 00:19:28,866 A:middle
This button here, it will
let you download an archive

469
00:19:28,866 --> 00:19:30,536 A:middle
or a product that
your bot created.

470
00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:32,086 A:middle
And Wi-Fi let you install it

471
00:19:32,086 --> 00:19:34,436 A:middle
on a device that's connected
locally, that's pretty cool.

472
00:19:34,586 --> 00:19:37,156 A:middle
And finally, on this menu over
here, you can edit the bot,

473
00:19:37,406 --> 00:19:39,046 A:middle
delete the bot, do
other things with it.

474
00:19:39,716 --> 00:19:42,196 A:middle
And below that, in the
status counts area,

475
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:45,366 A:middle
this shows you a high
level status for your bot

476
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:47,936 A:middle
for the last integration that
is the last run of your bot.

477
00:19:48,296 --> 00:19:50,436 A:middle
So if there are any errors or
warnings, you'll see that here.

478
00:19:50,966 --> 00:19:53,676 A:middle
If you chose settle the bot
from-- on static analysis,

479
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:55,316 A:middle
you'll see the status
of that there.

480
00:19:55,756 --> 00:19:58,256 A:middle
And if the bot is running
tests, you'll see the status

481
00:19:58,256 --> 00:19:59,116 A:middle
of those unit tests there.

482
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

483
00:20:00,236 --> 00:20:03,836 A:middle
Below that in the build history
chart, you see the status

484
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:06,246 A:middle
of all the integrations that are
displayed here and we show you

485
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,716 A:middle
as many integrations
as we can show you.

486
00:20:08,236 --> 00:20:10,146 A:middle
So, what you want to
see here is you want

487
00:20:10,146 --> 00:20:13,006 A:middle
to see there is a no issues
line with the green checkmark.

488
00:20:13,406 --> 00:20:15,776 A:middle
That means everything went well.

489
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:18,466 A:middle
You build bots and there
were no errors, warnings

490
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:19,596 A:middle
or static analysis issues.

491
00:20:20,256 --> 00:20:22,746 A:middle
But if you do have some, that's
okay, that's what this is for,

492
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:24,736 A:middle
they'll show up in
this stock bars

493
00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:28,756 A:middle
and these colors are obvious to
you, warnings on yellow, blue--

494
00:20:28,756 --> 00:20:31,496 A:middle
static analysis uses-- are in
blue and errors are in red.

495
00:20:32,016 --> 00:20:34,296 A:middle
And I can click this bar, I can
get a little more information

496
00:20:34,296 --> 00:20:36,046 A:middle
about what's going on,
and there's even a button

497
00:20:36,046 --> 00:20:36,556 A:middle
that will take me

498
00:20:36,556 --> 00:20:38,976 A:middle
to the integration summary
for this integration.

499
00:20:40,426 --> 00:20:41,176 A:middle
Let's keep going down.

500
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:44,156 A:middle
The chart below here shows me
the status of the unit tests

501
00:20:44,456 --> 00:20:46,126 A:middle
for all the integrations
that are displayed here

502
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:48,816 A:middle
and the goal here is to see
these full high green bars.

503
00:20:49,176 --> 00:20:50,736 A:middle
That means you had the
unit tests, they run

504
00:20:50,736 --> 00:20:52,196 A:middle
and they all run successfully.

505
00:20:53,746 --> 00:20:57,466 A:middle
Below that in the integration
details area, this shows you all

506
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:59,186 A:middle
of the crucial information
from the logs

507
00:20:59,186 --> 00:21:01,016 A:middle
that were created
when this bot run.

508
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

509
00:21:01,316 --> 00:21:02,446 A:middle
So you made-- the only sub--

510
00:21:02,526 --> 00:21:05,936 A:middle
logs for the build and you may
have logs for analysis issues

511
00:21:05,936 --> 00:21:06,886 A:middle
or test failures

512
00:21:06,886 --> 00:21:08,686 A:middle
if you configure your
bot to do those things.

513
00:21:09,626 --> 00:21:11,186 A:middle
What's really neat
about this view is

514
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:14,086 A:middle
that it's fully integrated
with all of the navigation

515
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:15,176 A:middle
that you used to in Xcode.

516
00:21:15,596 --> 00:21:17,066 A:middle
So what does that mean?

517
00:21:17,136 --> 00:21:18,946 A:middle
I'll make my window a
little wider here to--

518
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:21,786 A:middle
so you can see that.

519
00:21:21,786 --> 00:21:24,786 A:middle
So that means when I open the
assistant editor which I do

520
00:21:25,156 --> 00:21:27,256 A:middle
from the tool bar and this is

521
00:21:27,256 --> 00:21:29,766 A:middle
where I get a left side
by side editor view.

522
00:21:29,766 --> 00:21:32,396 A:middle
The left editor essentially
acts as the master editor

523
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:35,066 A:middle
when the assistant editor is
in the Reference Files Mode.

524
00:21:35,386 --> 00:21:37,176 A:middle
I can click one of
these failures down here

525
00:21:37,176 --> 00:21:38,706 A:middle
and Xcode will take me
right to the source code

526
00:21:38,706 --> 00:21:39,596 A:middle
where this problem occurred.

527
00:21:40,336 --> 00:21:43,306 A:middle
So this is a really fast
and great way to get

528
00:21:43,306 --> 00:21:44,106 A:middle
to the heart of the problem.

529
00:21:45,426 --> 00:21:48,376 A:middle
So now we're using bot to
figure out what went wrong.

530
00:21:48,696 --> 00:21:50,996 A:middle
We see unit tests
here and we can dig

531
00:21:51,296 --> 00:21:54,906 A:middle
into the bot a little
further to diagnose the issue.

532
00:21:54,906 --> 00:21:59,236 A:middle
I'm pretty sure Andrew
caused this problem by one

533
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:01,666 A:middle
of his classic late night
integration sessions

534
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

535
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:03,496 A:middle
where he wasn't as
careful as he usually

536
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:04,556 A:middle
as about checking things in.

537
00:22:04,746 --> 00:22:08,086 A:middle
I can explore that a little bit
more if I click the bar here--

538
00:22:08,936 --> 00:22:10,496 A:middle
that's never happened before.

539
00:22:11,756 --> 00:22:14,436 A:middle
This will jump me right
into the Integration Report

540
00:22:14,946 --> 00:22:17,146 A:middle
and you can see there
are four tabs here.

541
00:22:17,356 --> 00:22:20,256 A:middle
One of the tabs is the Commits
tab and indeed when I go

542
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:23,056 A:middle
to that I see the Commit Log
for this particular integration.

543
00:22:23,446 --> 00:22:25,086 A:middle
And looks like Andrew is
messing with me a little bit

544
00:22:25,086 --> 00:22:26,806 A:middle
and he deliberately
broke this field.

545
00:22:27,156 --> 00:22:31,816 A:middle
I'm going to go back and I'm
just going to change this

546
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:35,776 A:middle
so I know that there are
actually are five tea-flavored

547
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,856 A:middle
colors of Bubblegum here.

548
00:22:38,596 --> 00:22:46,406 A:middle
So I'll just change this and
I'm going to save and I'm going

549
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,606 A:middle
to check this in so we
can run an integration

550
00:22:48,606 --> 00:22:49,496 A:middle
and see what that looks like.

551
00:22:51,836 --> 00:22:56,166 A:middle
Fixing tests, commit.

552
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:57,436 A:middle
Okay. So while that's running,

553
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:59,786 A:middle
let's explore the bot
report a little bit more

554
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

555
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,146 A:middle
and to close this is another.

556
00:23:02,236 --> 00:23:04,556 A:middle
So there are two tabs, there is
a Summary Tab that's we've been

557
00:23:04,556 --> 00:23:06,396 A:middle
looking at and there's
the Test Tab

558
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,056 A:middle
and this is a really great view
because it shows you the history

559
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,476 A:middle
of the unit tests for
all the integrations

560
00:23:11,566 --> 00:23:12,476 A:middle
that we can display here.

561
00:23:12,626 --> 00:23:13,816 A:middle
We can display a
lot of integrations.

562
00:23:14,586 --> 00:23:16,336 A:middle
You saw this this morning,
this is a really great view

563
00:23:16,336 --> 00:23:19,076 A:middle
because it shows you at a glance
how a particular unit test is

564
00:23:19,076 --> 00:23:21,536 A:middle
doing and you can see most of
mine are doing really well.

565
00:23:21,796 --> 00:23:24,036 A:middle
I can filter this table to show
me just the ones that failed

566
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,706 A:middle
and if there's a particular test
that's been giving you trouble

567
00:23:26,996 --> 00:23:28,926 A:middle
and you know its name, you
might type that in here

568
00:23:29,346 --> 00:23:30,696 A:middle
and filter the table even more.

569
00:23:31,246 --> 00:23:33,646 A:middle
Of course, over time, your
server is going to build

570
00:23:33,986 --> 00:23:35,906 A:middle
up history for thousands
of integrations

571
00:23:36,376 --> 00:23:39,146 A:middle
and you need an ability to
go back and forth in time

572
00:23:39,146 --> 00:23:40,126 A:middle
to check these things out.

573
00:23:40,376 --> 00:23:42,336 A:middle
So you can see how this
interesting trend line here

574
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,336 A:middle
where I had most of
my unit test breaking

575
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:47,176 A:middle
and then they all got better
so I can move the loop

576
00:23:47,356 --> 00:23:49,856 A:middle
in this graph and I can
slope just the integrations

577
00:23:49,856 --> 00:23:50,396 A:middle
like here about.

578
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:53,976 A:middle
And these views also integrated
with the assistant editor

579
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:58,386 A:middle
so I can bring it up again
and when I select a test case,

580
00:23:58,386 --> 00:24:01,686 A:middle
it will show me the source code
for that particular test case.

581
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

582
00:24:01,896 --> 00:24:03,006 A:middle
I think that's really great.

583
00:24:03,336 --> 00:24:06,736 A:middle
So let's jump back to the
report for the integration.

584
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:08,376 A:middle
I can also see the
latest integrations

585
00:24:08,376 --> 00:24:09,196 A:middle
in the log navigator.

586
00:24:09,496 --> 00:24:11,656 A:middle
I'm going to click
this one here.

587
00:24:12,206 --> 00:24:14,406 A:middle
Let's just explore
this a little more.

588
00:24:15,566 --> 00:24:17,406 A:middle
The Summary tab is very similar

589
00:24:17,406 --> 00:24:19,016 A:middle
to the Summary tab
for the bot itself.

590
00:24:19,016 --> 00:24:20,436 A:middle
It shows you the
high level status.

591
00:24:20,576 --> 00:24:22,296 A:middle
It shows you the important
integration details.

592
00:24:22,886 --> 00:24:24,836 A:middle
There's also the Logs tab

593
00:24:24,836 --> 00:24:26,886 A:middle
and that shows you the
exact same Build logs

594
00:24:26,886 --> 00:24:27,336 A:middle
that you would see

595
00:24:27,336 --> 00:24:31,126 A:middle
if you performed this
particular bot run locally,

596
00:24:31,186 --> 00:24:32,516 A:middle
if you perform this
build locally.

597
00:24:33,046 --> 00:24:33,846 A:middle
So this is really great.

598
00:24:33,846 --> 00:24:35,436 A:middle
You can have the server
storing these logs

599
00:24:35,436 --> 00:24:36,846 A:middle
for thousands of integrations.

600
00:24:36,846 --> 00:24:37,976 A:middle
You don't have to
store them locally.

601
00:24:38,326 --> 00:24:40,346 A:middle
Whenever you needed that data
and you want to look at it,

602
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:41,996 A:middle
Xcode will download it
for you and that's one

603
00:24:41,996 --> 00:24:44,616 A:middle
of the great benefits of having
a server that's performing your

604
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:45,496 A:middle
continuous integration.

605
00:24:45,706 --> 00:24:47,406 A:middle
But let's look at the Test tab.

606
00:24:47,406 --> 00:24:51,286 A:middle
Starting this is the most
exciting part of this feature.

607
00:24:51,806 --> 00:24:54,356 A:middle
So what you can see here,
there are four devices listed.

608
00:24:54,636 --> 00:24:56,206 A:middle
They're actually all
right here connected

609
00:24:57,026 --> 00:25:01,036 A:middle
and what this means is the Xcode
Service is running unit tests

610
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

611
00:25:01,146 --> 00:25:02,496 A:middle
on all these devices.

612
00:25:02,796 --> 00:25:03,456 A:middle
Now, think about this.

613
00:25:03,576 --> 00:25:06,076 A:middle
There's never been a way to
do this automatically before.

614
00:25:06,456 --> 00:25:09,026 A:middle
There's never been a way
for Xcode to run unit tests

615
00:25:09,026 --> 00:25:10,606 A:middle
on multiple iOS devices at once.

616
00:25:10,936 --> 00:25:11,836 A:middle
And this is a huge deal.

617
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:14,696 A:middle
If you want to see how your
product performs with iOS 7,

618
00:25:14,696 --> 00:25:16,746 A:middle
for example, whether up
on one of your devices,

619
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:19,696 A:middle
plug it into your OS X Server
that's running the continues

620
00:25:19,696 --> 00:25:21,486 A:middle
integration service
and you'll get

621
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:22,986 A:middle
to see you get a
high level overview

622
00:25:23,036 --> 00:25:26,876 A:middle
of how your software is
doing on that new OS.

623
00:25:26,876 --> 00:25:29,996 A:middle
I think that's very cool for
people who have been writing

624
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:32,206 A:middle
in the test and have
a lot of time

625
00:25:32,206 --> 00:25:33,296 A:middle
and energy invested in them.

626
00:25:33,746 --> 00:25:36,116 A:middle
This is going to immediately
add a lot of value to them.

627
00:25:36,116 --> 00:25:38,556 A:middle
And for those of you who
haven't been writing in a test,

628
00:25:38,556 --> 00:25:40,176 A:middle
I think this is a
great reason to start.

629
00:25:41,136 --> 00:25:43,456 A:middle
And, again, this
is all connected

630
00:25:43,456 --> 00:25:46,236 A:middle
with the assistant editor so
you can click Test Case and jump

631
00:25:46,236 --> 00:25:46,766 A:middle
to the source code

632
00:25:46,766 --> 00:25:47,926 A:middle
and do everything you
would expect to do.

633
00:25:49,316 --> 00:25:50,686 A:middle
So we've explored
the bot report,

634
00:25:50,686 --> 00:25:52,496 A:middle
we've explored the bot
integration report,

635
00:25:53,076 --> 00:25:55,136 A:middle
but what does it like
to create a new bot?

636
00:25:55,996 --> 00:25:59,356 A:middle
And to do that-- and I
should create a new project.

637
00:25:59,706 --> 00:26:01,636 A:middle
I'll show you what it looks
like from the beginning.

638
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

639
00:26:02,406 --> 00:26:04,286 A:middle
So, I'll put in an
Xcode project,

640
00:26:04,286 --> 00:26:07,636 A:middle
I would just create a simple
iOS Utility Application--

641
00:26:08,076 --> 00:26:10,746 A:middle
I'll just call it Demo App.

642
00:26:11,026 --> 00:26:17,486 A:middle
So in this Safe panel
here, you probably noticed

643
00:26:17,516 --> 00:26:19,936 A:middle
for a while an Xcode
4 has offered

644
00:26:19,936 --> 00:26:22,006 A:middle
to create a local GIT
repository for this project

645
00:26:22,006 --> 00:26:23,396 A:middle
and that's a really
great thing to do.

646
00:26:24,196 --> 00:26:26,866 A:middle
But now if you've added an
account for an OS X Server

647
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:29,826 A:middle
in the Accounts Prep Pane,
it will list any server here.

648
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:33,236 A:middle
And if I choose this server
which I'll do and click Create,

649
00:26:33,236 --> 00:26:35,966 A:middle
let me draw your attention
to the Activity View up here.

650
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:39,006 A:middle
What's going to happen is
Xcode is going to create

651
00:26:39,006 --> 00:26:40,206 A:middle
that local GIT repository.

652
00:26:40,716 --> 00:26:43,336 A:middle
It's going to create the remote
GIT repository and it's going

653
00:26:43,336 --> 00:26:44,186 A:middle
to push it up to the server.

654
00:26:44,586 --> 00:26:46,196 A:middle
So now you have the
best of both worlds,

655
00:26:46,196 --> 00:26:48,266 A:middle
you have a local GIT
repository, your Scratch Pad

656
00:26:48,266 --> 00:26:50,436 A:middle
and when you're ready to show
those changes into your team,

657
00:26:50,686 --> 00:26:53,076 A:middle
there's already a server that's
backing up your data for you,

658
00:26:53,286 --> 00:26:56,456 A:middle
you push those changes up there
and your team has access to it.

659
00:26:57,646 --> 00:26:59,516 A:middle
This is really great.

660
00:26:59,716 --> 00:27:02,496 A:middle
Okay. So we created a new
project, let's create a bot.

661
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

662
00:27:02,796 --> 00:27:05,746 A:middle
We do that in a Product Menu,
there's a Create Bot item.

663
00:27:06,636 --> 00:27:09,296 A:middle
So this is a new project
so there's only one scheme.

664
00:27:09,806 --> 00:27:12,476 A:middle
You probably have a few schemes
in your project and in order

665
00:27:12,476 --> 00:27:15,056 A:middle
for the bot to build
your project,

666
00:27:15,056 --> 00:27:15,876 A:middle
you need to share the scheme.

667
00:27:15,876 --> 00:27:18,326 A:middle
We can do that automatically
for you but--

668
00:27:18,326 --> 00:27:20,466 A:middle
and you should keep this check
but I'm going to uncheck it

669
00:27:20,466 --> 00:27:22,666 A:middle
so I can show you-- I want you
to understand what this means.

670
00:27:22,966 --> 00:27:24,126 A:middle
I'll show you how
to do this manually.

671
00:27:24,806 --> 00:27:29,006 A:middle
I want this bot to run my unit
tests whenever anyone checks

672
00:27:29,006 --> 00:27:31,776 A:middle
in codes so we'll call that,
I'm choosing the server here

673
00:27:32,726 --> 00:27:36,016 A:middle
and I'll uncheck that
particular button there.

674
00:27:36,616 --> 00:27:37,846 A:middle
Okay. While-- We'll
keep that checks

675
00:27:37,846 --> 00:27:38,816 A:middle
since it will let me otherwise

676
00:27:38,816 --> 00:27:40,736 A:middle
but I'll still let you
know, help you out.

677
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,736 A:middle
I want this bot to
run on Commit.

678
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:45,366 A:middle
Again, you have your choice here
when you want your bot to run,

679
00:27:45,366 --> 00:27:46,666 A:middle
and you can edit this
at any time later.

680
00:27:47,016 --> 00:27:50,906 A:middle
And as Andrew said, you get to
decide what you want your bot

681
00:27:50,906 --> 00:27:53,436 A:middle
to do so of course your
bot is always going

682
00:27:53,436 --> 00:27:54,176 A:middle
to build your projects.

683
00:27:54,176 --> 00:27:56,416 A:middle
So you're always going to know
if there are warnings or errors,

684
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,386 A:middle
but these three other
things are optional.

685
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:01,166 A:middle
You may or may not want your
bot to run static analysis,

686
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

687
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:02,926 A:middle
to perform tests or
to build archives.

688
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:07,316 A:middle
In this case for this bot, I
just want it to run unit tests

689
00:28:07,316 --> 00:28:08,486 A:middle
so I'll uncheck these two

690
00:28:08,866 --> 00:28:10,846 A:middle
and we perform test
action intact there.

691
00:28:11,396 --> 00:28:14,426 A:middle
I'll click Next, and because
I told that I want to build--

692
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:15,846 A:middle
to run unit tests,
it's going to ask me

693
00:28:15,846 --> 00:28:17,916 A:middle
which iOS devices I
want it to run on.

694
00:28:18,206 --> 00:28:19,846 A:middle
I have four here and
I think they should--

695
00:28:19,846 --> 00:28:21,006 A:middle
the test should be
run on all of those

696
00:28:21,006 --> 00:28:22,526 A:middle
but you can configure
this the way you want.

697
00:28:22,716 --> 00:28:27,226 A:middle
I'll click Next and, again,
so what happens by default

698
00:28:27,226 --> 00:28:28,896 A:middle
when the build fails
is anyone who committed

699
00:28:28,896 --> 00:28:30,976 A:middle
since the last integration
will get an e-mail

700
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:32,546 A:middle
but you can configure
this however you want.

701
00:28:32,706 --> 00:28:35,406 A:middle
So it's just a few
clicks and we've created

702
00:28:35,406 --> 00:28:37,216 A:middle
in a bot for this project.

703
00:28:37,786 --> 00:28:40,896 A:middle
Yes, the bot scheme
needs to be committed.

704
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,996 A:middle
Exactly. So what
this is all about?

705
00:28:42,996 --> 00:28:47,006 A:middle
Well, let's go into the manage
scheme sheet here for a second

706
00:28:47,436 --> 00:28:48,936 A:middle
and you can see this
check box is checked

707
00:28:49,086 --> 00:28:50,466 A:middle
which is a good thing
in this case.

708
00:28:50,686 --> 00:28:52,846 A:middle
So I need the scheme
to be shared

709
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:54,696 A:middle
so that the bot can
build my product

710
00:28:54,696 --> 00:28:58,006 A:middle
and my default schemes are
not shared so that check box

711
00:28:58,046 --> 00:29:00,036 A:middle
that I left checked in
the Assistant, that's good

712
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

713
00:29:00,336 --> 00:29:02,956 A:middle
but if you don't do that, you
can always show your scheme

714
00:29:03,046 --> 00:29:04,246 A:middle
into the Manage Scheme
sheet here.

715
00:29:05,136 --> 00:29:08,236 A:middle
I'll click Okay and when I do
that Xcode change to the files

716
00:29:08,236 --> 00:29:10,036 A:middle
that are involved in the
schemes so I need to commit

717
00:29:10,036 --> 00:29:13,156 A:middle
and push those up to the
server and you can see here

718
00:29:13,206 --> 00:29:15,416 A:middle
in the Commit sheet
there's these things related

719
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:18,296 A:middle
to the scheme you don't need
to worry about what they are

720
00:29:18,676 --> 00:29:22,066 A:middle
but you do need to do this in
order for the bot field to run.

721
00:29:22,766 --> 00:29:25,736 A:middle
So I've committed those
changes and I can force it

722
00:29:25,736 --> 00:29:29,666 A:middle
to integrate now and you can
see the integration has started.

723
00:29:30,576 --> 00:29:33,436 A:middle
So really easy to create a
new bot with the rich sourcing

724
00:29:33,436 --> 00:29:35,476 A:middle
for integration that
we have with these--

725
00:29:35,736 --> 00:29:37,586 A:middle
these two parts of this
system that's why it's easy

726
00:29:37,586 --> 00:29:39,826 A:middle
to get source control
and get source code

727
00:29:39,926 --> 00:29:42,386 A:middle
and to push source code
back up to the server.

728
00:29:43,056 --> 00:29:45,646 A:middle
And I can see here,
you can't see it

729
00:29:45,716 --> 00:29:46,616 A:middle
but test are already running

730
00:29:46,616 --> 00:29:48,146 A:middle
on these devices
which is very cool.

731
00:29:48,756 --> 00:29:50,396 A:middle
So with that, I'm going
to give it back to Andrew

732
00:29:50,396 --> 00:29:52,436 A:middle
so he can show you
more about the web UI

733
00:29:52,436 --> 00:29:53,836 A:middle
where we surface
all these things to.

734
00:29:54,246 --> 00:29:54,586 A:middle
Thank you.

735
00:29:55,516 --> 00:30:01,536 A:middle
[ Applause ]

736
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

737
00:30:02,036 --> 00:30:02,726 A:middle
>> Thank you, Brent.

738
00:30:04,516 --> 00:30:06,276 A:middle
Could we switch back
the slides, Brent?

739
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:06,566 A:middle
>> Yes.

740
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:07,256 A:middle
>> Please?

741
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,066 A:middle
You get my demo away.

742
00:30:11,586 --> 00:30:14,746 A:middle
Okay. So, Brent just showed
you how awesome the Continuous

743
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,516 A:middle
Integration support
as an Xcode 5.

744
00:30:16,516 --> 00:30:20,736 A:middle
And just to recap what you
saw, we have a newer kind

745
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,596 A:middle
of Preferences tab and
the Preferences pane.

746
00:30:22,776 --> 00:30:25,346 A:middle
So it's really easy to
add and use server kinds

747
00:30:25,346 --> 00:30:26,386 A:middle
to the Xcode preferences.

748
00:30:27,006 --> 00:30:30,236 A:middle
You can connect to
servers using username

749
00:30:30,236 --> 00:30:32,286 A:middle
and password or as a guest.

750
00:30:33,096 --> 00:30:34,836 A:middle
And once you've done
that, the server shows up.

751
00:30:34,836 --> 00:30:36,106 A:middle
And once you have a server,

752
00:30:36,106 --> 00:30:38,006 A:middle
you're now in a position
whereby you can check

753
00:30:38,006 --> 00:30:40,596 A:middle
out the source code that's
hosted on those servers.

754
00:30:40,596 --> 00:30:42,026 A:middle
Xcode will automatically figure

755
00:30:42,026 --> 00:30:43,756 A:middle
out what source repositories
exist on the server

756
00:30:43,756 --> 00:30:44,756 A:middle
and offer to check those out.

757
00:30:45,866 --> 00:30:48,856 A:middle
So we chose the Bubblegum,
I'm going to check it out.

758
00:30:48,856 --> 00:30:51,766 A:middle
And by clicking in the
log navigator on the bot,

759
00:30:51,886 --> 00:30:53,596 A:middle
we could see the
bot summary report.

760
00:30:53,736 --> 00:30:55,796 A:middle
And here you see all the
beautiful test information

761
00:30:55,796 --> 00:30:56,486 A:middle
for your bot.

762
00:30:56,486 --> 00:30:59,126 A:middle
Along the top, you see
so many kinds for errors,

763
00:30:59,126 --> 00:31:00,856 A:middle
issues and warnings
and test results.

764
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

765
00:31:01,536 --> 00:31:04,766 A:middle
In the center you see summary
grafts for your build history

766
00:31:04,766 --> 00:31:06,386 A:middle
and your test result history.

767
00:31:06,386 --> 00:31:08,906 A:middle
And at the bottom you see
some integration details

768
00:31:08,906 --> 00:31:10,756 A:middle
for the most recent integration.

769
00:31:13,186 --> 00:31:15,576 A:middle
Expanding the side bar you
see each of the integrations

770
00:31:15,576 --> 00:31:16,716 A:middle
that this bot has performed.

771
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:20,546 A:middle
I'm looking at the test results
view, you see a beautiful graph

772
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:23,596 A:middle
of your test results over time
for all of your integrations.

773
00:31:24,096 --> 00:31:27,356 A:middle
And of course the best way is

774
00:31:27,356 --> 00:31:28,716 A:middle
that we support multiple
devices.

775
00:31:28,716 --> 00:31:30,406 A:middle
So when you click in a
particular integration and look

776
00:31:30,406 --> 00:31:32,846 A:middle
at the test tab for bot
integration, you'll see all

777
00:31:32,846 --> 00:31:34,746 A:middle
of the tests split
out by device.

778
00:31:34,746 --> 00:31:36,066 A:middle
You could see which
tests are passing,

779
00:31:36,066 --> 00:31:38,296 A:middle
which tests are failing
on which device.

780
00:31:39,756 --> 00:31:42,086 A:middle
And of course we have the
assistant editor support

781
00:31:42,086 --> 00:31:42,476 A:middle
as well.

782
00:31:42,476 --> 00:31:44,586 A:middle
So when you're digging around
in the test result table,

783
00:31:45,306 --> 00:31:46,546 A:middle
you can see the information

784
00:31:46,546 --> 00:31:47,886 A:middle
of the assistant
editor on the right.

785
00:31:49,816 --> 00:31:52,546 A:middle
Finally, Brent showed you what
it takes to set up a new project

786
00:31:53,226 --> 00:31:56,746 A:middle
and host out source
code on an OS X Server.

787
00:31:56,786 --> 00:32:02,206 A:middle
And with just a few clicks, it
created a rebuild and it was

788
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

789
00:32:02,206 --> 00:32:04,346 A:middle
on the server ready for him and
the rest of his team to use.

790
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:07,736 A:middle
So the last thing that
I would like to talk

791
00:32:07,736 --> 00:32:09,806 A:middle
about today is our
web application.

792
00:32:09,806 --> 00:32:11,386 A:middle
And the web application
is really designed

793
00:32:11,386 --> 00:32:12,736 A:middle
for everyone who's involved

794
00:32:12,736 --> 00:32:15,246 A:middle
in the development process
that's not necessarily living

795
00:32:15,246 --> 00:32:16,506 A:middle
inside Xcode all day.

796
00:32:16,506 --> 00:32:19,576 A:middle
And I'm sure there are lot
of people that you work

797
00:32:19,576 --> 00:32:21,206 A:middle
with that fall in
to this category.

798
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:23,446 A:middle
There are localizers,
there are testers,

799
00:32:23,516 --> 00:32:25,626 A:middle
there are project
managers if you're lucky

800
00:32:25,626 --> 00:32:26,696 A:middle
or unlucky to have one.

801
00:32:27,076 --> 00:32:31,036 A:middle
But the web application
becomes a really useful feature

802
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:31,696 A:middle
for those people.

803
00:32:32,896 --> 00:32:34,986 A:middle
The web application
will give you a view

804
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,966 A:middle
of your project outside
of Xcode.

805
00:32:36,966 --> 00:32:40,136 A:middle
So Xcode will only show you bots
that are relevant for projects

806
00:32:40,136 --> 00:32:42,126 A:middle
and workspaces that you
currently have open.

807
00:32:42,806 --> 00:32:44,906 A:middle
The server will give you
a server-centric view

808
00:32:44,906 --> 00:32:45,836 A:middle
of these projects.

809
00:32:45,836 --> 00:32:49,006 A:middle
So you see a list of all the
bots that live on your server.

810
00:32:51,626 --> 00:32:55,266 A:middle
And you can easily add and edit
bots right from the web for all

811
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:57,516 A:middle
of the repositories that your
server already knows how to talk

812
00:32:57,516 --> 00:32:59,146 A:middle
to so those can be
host of repositories

813
00:32:59,146 --> 00:33:00,206 A:middle
or remote repositories

814
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

815
00:33:00,206 --> 00:33:03,866 A:middle
that you've already
connected up in server app.

816
00:33:04,026 --> 00:33:07,046 A:middle
And once you click on a bot, you
see the same beautiful reports

817
00:33:07,046 --> 00:33:09,636 A:middle
that we have on Xcode.

818
00:33:09,636 --> 00:33:12,526 A:middle
One feature that's unique to the
web application is the archive C

819
00:33:12,526 --> 00:33:14,716 A:middle
and admittedly this feature
that we stole from one

820
00:33:14,716 --> 00:33:15,806 A:middle
of our internal systems.

821
00:33:15,896 --> 00:33:19,316 A:middle
And this becomes the destination
place for your tester

822
00:33:19,316 --> 00:33:22,356 A:middle
in the morning to go and get a
list of the most recent products

823
00:33:22,356 --> 00:33:23,916 A:middle
or archive for your application.

824
00:33:24,156 --> 00:33:26,736 A:middle
So there's obviously archive
in product downloading.

825
00:33:27,226 --> 00:33:28,776 A:middle
But we have some really
nice features too.

826
00:33:29,396 --> 00:33:30,666 A:middle
There's build flagging.

827
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:33,776 A:middle
So you can flag a build as being
a great build or flag a build

828
00:33:33,776 --> 00:33:35,106 A:middle
as being a terrible
build depending

829
00:33:35,106 --> 00:33:36,586 A:middle
on your definition
of being flagged.

830
00:33:36,586 --> 00:33:39,516 A:middle
And of course we
support build printing.

831
00:33:39,516 --> 00:33:41,466 A:middle
So if you know that you
have a build that's sitting

832
00:33:41,466 --> 00:33:43,406 A:middle
in your list that you maybe
don't want to keep around

833
00:33:43,406 --> 00:33:45,386 A:middle
or that you know was a
particularly bad build,

834
00:33:45,436 --> 00:33:47,066 A:middle
you can instantly delete
it just with one click.

835
00:33:47,116 --> 00:33:52,146 A:middle
And probably my favorite feature
of the web application is

836
00:33:52,146 --> 00:33:56,396 A:middle
that if you point an iOS device
at the web app with one tap.

837
00:33:56,396 --> 00:33:58,706 A:middle
You can install a
build application

838
00:33:58,706 --> 00:34:00,736 A:middle
from the Xcode Service
right in your iOS device.

839
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

840
00:34:01,516 --> 00:34:07,936 A:middle
[ Applause ]

841
00:34:08,436 --> 00:34:11,025 A:middle
And then we have another great
feature that we call Scoreboard.

842
00:34:11,746 --> 00:34:14,106 A:middle
And you've all seen it I'm sure
but I'll save that one for demo.

843
00:34:14,406 --> 00:34:17,246 A:middle
So with that, let's look at the
demo of the new web application

844
00:34:17,315 --> 00:34:18,485 A:middle
and the Xcode Service.

845
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:22,616 A:middle
So here I am in Safari
and to get

846
00:34:22,616 --> 00:34:24,726 A:middle
to the web application you've
got a number of options.

847
00:34:25,126 --> 00:34:28,096 A:middle
Inside Xcode when you're looking
at the bot we have a Gear menu

848
00:34:28,096 --> 00:34:29,896 A:middle
and you can click on the Gear
menu there's a handy link

849
00:34:29,896 --> 00:34:31,366 A:middle
in there and it takes
you right to the web app.

850
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:35,235 A:middle
If you have a host name for
your server and that may be,

851
00:34:35,295 --> 00:34:37,966 A:middle
you know, a local host name
for your server, you can visit

852
00:34:37,966 --> 00:34:39,775 A:middle
that hosting and it will take
you right to this web app.

853
00:34:40,206 --> 00:34:42,126 A:middle
And also if you're in
server app, we have a link

854
00:34:42,126 --> 00:34:43,436 A:middle
that takes you right
to the web app too.

855
00:34:43,696 --> 00:34:48,025 A:middle
So this is the bot list
for the web application.

856
00:34:48,025 --> 00:34:50,476 A:middle
And you'll see that we have
an alphanumeric sorted list

857
00:34:50,476 --> 00:34:51,436 A:middle
of the bots down the left

858
00:34:52,005 --> 00:34:54,166 A:middle
and you see some great
information for those bots.

859
00:34:54,966 --> 00:34:57,486 A:middle
We see we have a number of bots
here and a number of states.

860
00:34:57,546 --> 00:35:00,176 A:middle
Some bots are succeeding,
some bots are queued ready

861
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

862
00:35:00,176 --> 00:35:02,626 A:middle
to be built, some bots
are failing tests,

863
00:35:02,966 --> 00:35:05,356 A:middle
some bots actually have
catastrophic build failures

864
00:35:05,356 --> 00:35:05,646 A:middle
right now.

865
00:35:06,576 --> 00:35:08,896 A:middle
Along the top you see some
summary information for the bots

866
00:35:08,896 --> 00:35:09,896 A:middle
that are running on your server.

867
00:35:09,896 --> 00:35:12,456 A:middle
So the most recent bot that
Brent actually just created

868
00:35:12,456 --> 00:35:14,486 A:middle
in run, we could see
it has zero errors,

869
00:35:14,486 --> 00:35:15,736 A:middle
warnings, or analysis issues.

870
00:35:16,286 --> 00:35:18,566 A:middle
The Bubblegum Nightly
bot just kicked off

871
00:35:18,566 --> 00:35:20,216 A:middle
and on the right you can see

872
00:35:20,216 --> 00:35:22,496 A:middle
that we have handy download
links for the Bubblegum bot too.

873
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:26,806 A:middle
So let's click on the
Bubblegum bot and explore

874
00:35:26,806 --> 00:35:27,936 A:middle
that in a little
bit more detail.

875
00:35:30,476 --> 00:35:32,486 A:middle
So here you see we
have the same reports

876
00:35:32,486 --> 00:35:33,676 A:middle
that you see inside of Xcode.

877
00:35:34,626 --> 00:35:36,436 A:middle
We have five great
tabs along the top,

878
00:35:36,706 --> 00:35:37,906 A:middle
they give you summary
information,

879
00:35:37,906 --> 00:35:40,196 A:middle
information about your Tests,
information about your Commits,

880
00:35:40,196 --> 00:35:42,646 A:middle
your Logs and of course the
Archives page which is unique

881
00:35:42,646 --> 00:35:43,576 A:middle
to the web application.

882
00:35:43,626 --> 00:35:46,276 A:middle
I can click around and just

883
00:35:46,276 --> 00:35:48,546 A:middle
like in Xcode I can see
the full test history

884
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,296 A:middle
for my project right
here on the web browser.

885
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:53,736 A:middle
And I can scroll back in
time just like in Xcode

886
00:35:53,786 --> 00:35:55,956 A:middle
to select any range of
test brought up that I'd

887
00:35:55,956 --> 00:35:57,046 A:middle
like to explore a
little bit more.

888
00:35:59,026 --> 00:36:00,646 A:middle
So you can see here
that our project went

889
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

890
00:36:00,646 --> 00:36:02,386 A:middle
through a particularly
rough patch of having a lot

891
00:36:02,386 --> 00:36:04,206 A:middle
of failing test and then
we slowly brought that back

892
00:36:04,206 --> 00:36:05,326 A:middle
in to zero again which is great.

893
00:36:05,406 --> 00:36:07,206 A:middle
That's exactly what
we wanted to do.

894
00:36:08,076 --> 00:36:10,676 A:middle
We have the Commits tabs and the
Logs tab which I'll skip over,

895
00:36:10,726 --> 00:36:12,236 A:middle
and I'll go straight
to the Archives tab

896
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,096 A:middle
because that's the most
interesting part of this--

897
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:15,176 A:middle
part of the web application.

898
00:36:15,396 --> 00:36:19,746 A:middle
So the Archives tab is a time
sorted list of the products

899
00:36:19,806 --> 00:36:22,346 A:middle
and the archives for all the
bots that live on your server.

900
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,206 A:middle
And each bot has its
own Archive's page.

901
00:36:25,406 --> 00:36:28,456 A:middle
You can see that on the left
we have some great flag icons.

902
00:36:28,736 --> 00:36:30,936 A:middle
So I know that yesterday's
build was a great build.

903
00:36:31,226 --> 00:36:33,686 A:middle
We shipped the build for
WWDC of the Bubblegum app

904
00:36:33,806 --> 00:36:36,026 A:middle
and we know it was good so
I'm going to mark that one

905
00:36:36,026 --> 00:36:37,776 A:middle
as a flag build,
such a great build.

906
00:36:39,436 --> 00:36:42,106 A:middle
And also if have
build here that I know

907
00:36:42,106 --> 00:36:44,286 A:middle
that the day before yesterday
was maybe not a great build.

908
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:46,306 A:middle
I can easily click the
trashcan here and just delete

909
00:36:46,756 --> 00:36:47,656 A:middle
that build with one click.

910
00:36:50,426 --> 00:36:51,896 A:middle
The other feature that we have

911
00:36:51,986 --> 00:36:54,236 A:middle
in the web application
is Scoreboard.

912
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:57,916 A:middle
And Scoreboard is designed
for the big screen TV

913
00:36:58,486 --> 00:37:01,546 A:middle
or spare monitor presentation
of all the bots in your server.

914
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

915
00:37:02,036 --> 00:37:04,496 A:middle
So if you have an open
area in your workspace,

916
00:37:04,496 --> 00:37:06,766 A:middle
like a coffee area or you have
some space in your development

917
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,146 A:middle
and this is a perfect candidate
for mounting a display in a wall

918
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:10,666 A:middle
and having some fun with bots.

919
00:37:10,666 --> 00:37:12,026 A:middle
We do this at Apple
and this is great.

920
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:14,946 A:middle
So there are two ways
to get into Scoreboard.

921
00:37:15,176 --> 00:37:18,166 A:middle
First, I can click on the
navigation icon right here

922
00:37:18,166 --> 00:37:19,586 A:middle
and you can see we
have a Scoreboard link.

923
00:37:19,586 --> 00:37:21,006 A:middle
But we love Scoreboard so much

924
00:37:21,006 --> 00:37:23,986 A:middle
that we give Scoreboard its
own top level navigation item.

925
00:37:24,066 --> 00:37:26,976 A:middle
And right here beside the Plus
icon I can click on Scoreboard.

926
00:37:26,976 --> 00:37:31,436 A:middle
And you can see this takes me
into Scoreboard for this server.

927
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,106 A:middle
So right now we have
a number of bots

928
00:37:34,176 --> 00:37:36,316 A:middle
and those bots are
sorted by name.

929
00:37:37,306 --> 00:37:39,416 A:middle
On the left you see we
have a list of the bots

930
00:37:39,416 --> 00:37:42,076 A:middle
and all their states and on
the right we have a huge card

931
00:37:42,076 --> 00:37:43,676 A:middle
with some great information
about this bot.

932
00:37:44,286 --> 00:37:47,246 A:middle
Along the top you see huge kinds
for the errors, issues, warnings

933
00:37:47,246 --> 00:37:48,626 A:middle
and test succeeds or fails.

934
00:37:49,596 --> 00:37:51,466 A:middle
You see a list of the
commits that contributed

935
00:37:51,466 --> 00:37:53,666 A:middle
to that integration and we just
cycle through those commits.

936
00:37:54,086 --> 00:37:57,136 A:middle
And at the bottom you see the
device information for the tests

937
00:37:57,276 --> 00:37:58,266 A:middle
that we run for this button.

938
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

939
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:03,326 A:middle
And as we cycle to the next bot,
you'll see some information.

940
00:38:03,996 --> 00:38:07,616 A:middle
And it looks like for this
bot, a number of tests were run

941
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,206 A:middle
and at the bottom we
have a bunch of devices

942
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:10,256 A:middle
on which those tests run.

943
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:13,426 A:middle
And it seems like Brent kicked
off the Bubblegum bot just

944
00:38:13,426 --> 00:38:14,336 A:middle
before he left the stage.

945
00:38:14,786 --> 00:38:16,626 A:middle
And that bot just
succeeded and we can see

946
00:38:16,626 --> 00:38:19,476 A:middle
that that has one analysis
issue and 27 passing test

947
00:38:19,476 --> 00:38:21,596 A:middle
across the four devices that
are connected to our server.

948
00:38:21,776 --> 00:38:22,866 A:middle
This was great.

949
00:38:24,816 --> 00:38:26,586 A:middle
So let's switch back to slides.

950
00:38:32,536 --> 00:38:34,156 A:middle
So that's the web application.

951
00:38:34,156 --> 00:38:36,816 A:middle
The web application is designed
for everyone who is not inside

952
00:38:36,816 --> 00:38:39,186 A:middle
of Xcode including developers
you may be away from Xcode

953
00:38:39,186 --> 00:38:40,146 A:middle
at any particular time.

954
00:38:40,696 --> 00:38:42,846 A:middle
You see the full list of bots
that exist on your server

955
00:38:43,756 --> 00:38:46,196 A:middle
and you can sort and filter
that list of bots really easily.

956
00:38:47,336 --> 00:38:49,896 A:middle
You see the same rich reports
that you see inside of Xcode.

957
00:38:49,896 --> 00:38:53,986 A:middle
And of course you can dig and
drill through test history

958
00:38:53,986 --> 00:38:54,836 A:middle
for your product just

959
00:38:54,836 --> 00:38:56,376 A:middle
by scrolling a graft
box three times.

960
00:38:58,476 --> 00:39:00,046 A:middle
And of course we have
the Archives page.

961
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

962
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,956 A:middle
And the Archives page is
a great way to ship builds

963
00:39:01,956 --> 00:39:02,846 A:middle
to the rest of your team.

964
00:39:02,846 --> 00:39:04,906 A:middle
Or to have one place the
people and your team can go

965
00:39:04,906 --> 00:39:07,266 A:middle
to every morning to download the
latest build of your project.

966
00:39:07,266 --> 00:39:09,816 A:middle
And, so these builds
can be flagged

967
00:39:09,896 --> 00:39:11,256 A:middle
or deleted at your choosing.

968
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:14,516 A:middle
And of course we have
the Scoreboard feature.

969
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:15,506 A:middle
And Scoreboard is great.

970
00:39:15,626 --> 00:39:17,286 A:middle
I would encourage you all
to set up a spare display

971
00:39:17,286 --> 00:39:19,596 A:middle
in your development room or if
you like, Brent and his bedroom.

972
00:39:19,596 --> 00:39:23,186 A:middle
And, you know, have
some fun with bot

973
00:39:23,216 --> 00:39:24,036 A:middle
so that makes it really fun.

974
00:39:25,936 --> 00:39:28,416 A:middle
So I did have some best
practices that I'd like to pass

975
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:31,706 A:middle
on based on our internal
usage of the Xcode Service

976
00:39:31,706 --> 00:39:33,566 A:middle
with our small and
large development teams.

977
00:39:35,696 --> 00:39:37,366 A:middle
The first is that
if you're sitting

978
00:39:37,366 --> 00:39:40,146 A:middle
in the audience here thinking
yeah you know, this is well

979
00:39:40,146 --> 00:39:42,416 A:middle
and good, this works great for,
you know, the small iOS app

980
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:44,996 A:middle
or the small mac or the apps
that are showing on stage

981
00:39:44,996 --> 00:39:46,446 A:middle
or any app apart from my app,

982
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:49,366 A:middle
maybe your source code
is structured in a weird

983
00:39:49,366 --> 00:39:52,426 A:middle
and wacky way where you have to
check out multiple nested copies

984
00:39:52,426 --> 00:39:56,286 A:middle
of source code or you have
multiple cross reference Xcode

985
00:39:56,286 --> 00:39:58,836 A:middle
project files or you know,
something pretty normal,

986
00:39:59,336 --> 00:40:00,916 A:middle
then you'll be glad to hear

987
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

988
00:40:00,916 --> 00:40:03,186 A:middle
that the Xcode Service
actually supports bots

989
00:40:03,256 --> 00:40:04,896 A:middle
that are configured
against multiple source

990
00:40:04,896 --> 00:40:05,796 A:middle
control repositories.

991
00:40:06,396 --> 00:40:08,856 A:middle
And the answer that I would have
for you for that questions is

992
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,996 A:middle
to structure your code in
workspaces and if you think

993
00:40:11,996 --> 00:40:14,536 A:middle
about this, this is the best way
that the server is going to be

994
00:40:14,536 --> 00:40:16,896 A:middle
in a position where it can
reassemble your source code

995
00:40:17,236 --> 00:40:19,416 A:middle
in a way that we can
build it the same way

996
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:20,786 A:middle
that you build the
source code locally.

997
00:40:22,516 --> 00:40:25,516 A:middle
The second is more of a security
best practice and that is

998
00:40:25,516 --> 00:40:27,356 A:middle
if you are connecting
your OS X Server

999
00:40:27,356 --> 00:40:31,216 A:middle
to existing remote repositories
with SVN or Git repositories,

1000
00:40:31,836 --> 00:40:33,636 A:middle
I would strongly encourage
you to use role accounts

1001
00:40:33,636 --> 00:40:34,416 A:middle
for those repositories.

1002
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:35,736 A:middle
That's just generally
a good practice.

1003
00:40:35,896 --> 00:40:38,896 A:middle
You don't necessarily want to be
entering your personal username

1004
00:40:38,896 --> 00:40:41,716 A:middle
and password onto the server and
having the server check out code

1005
00:40:41,716 --> 00:40:43,966 A:middle
as you that's why role
accounts were invented,

1006
00:40:43,966 --> 00:40:45,226 A:middle
they're really good
for that purpose.

1007
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:47,276 A:middle
And also I would
also encourage you

1008
00:40:47,276 --> 00:40:49,876 A:middle
to use SSH public/private
key pair authentication

1009
00:40:49,876 --> 00:40:51,956 A:middle
and the OS X Server that
makes it really easy

1010
00:40:52,406 --> 00:40:54,936 A:middle
to generate new public/private
key pairs and with one click,

1011
00:40:54,936 --> 00:40:56,936 A:middle
copy the public key right to
your clipboard so you can paste

1012
00:40:56,936 --> 00:40:58,686 A:middle
into websites like
GitHub in just a second.

1013
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1014
00:41:00,896 --> 00:41:02,276 A:middle
The third best practice

1015
00:41:02,276 --> 00:41:04,406 A:middle
that I have is actually
just some suggested bots.

1016
00:41:04,406 --> 00:41:06,136 A:middle
These are bots that
we set up that we find

1017
00:41:06,186 --> 00:41:07,196 A:middle
to be really, really useful.

1018
00:41:09,556 --> 00:41:12,136 A:middle
So the first of those
is a non-commit bot

1019
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,356 A:middle
and this one is fairly obvious
one but if you think about it,

1020
00:41:14,356 --> 00:41:16,316 A:middle
you will have the
supply in sitting

1021
00:41:16,316 --> 00:41:19,286 A:middle
in your office that's doing
building, that's doing testing,

1022
00:41:19,606 --> 00:41:21,726 A:middle
that's running static
analysis for your code base

1023
00:41:21,936 --> 00:41:24,496 A:middle
and running your tests for every
source control change that's

1024
00:41:24,496 --> 00:41:26,176 A:middle
made and that's a
really awesome feature.

1025
00:41:26,956 --> 00:41:29,266 A:middle
And if you have a
slightly larger project,

1026
00:41:29,566 --> 00:41:31,266 A:middle
you can adapt this
concept and say you would

1027
00:41:31,266 --> 00:41:34,236 A:middle
like to have a bot that's
doing this work every hour

1028
00:41:34,276 --> 00:41:36,406 A:middle
or once a day, that's a
really good thing to have.

1029
00:41:37,976 --> 00:41:41,076 A:middle
The second is a Nightly
bot, Nightly bots are great.

1030
00:41:41,296 --> 00:41:44,996 A:middle
Nightly bots can build and
archive your project just

1031
00:41:44,996 --> 00:41:48,166 A:middle
in the same way you do locally
and it will produce a signed Mac

1032
00:41:48,366 --> 00:41:51,356 A:middle
or a signed iOS Application
that your testers can come

1033
00:41:51,356 --> 00:41:54,026 A:middle
in the morning and click
in one link on the web app

1034
00:41:54,026 --> 00:41:56,186 A:middle
and download a build
ready to be tested.

1035
00:41:56,366 --> 00:41:57,006 A:middle
So this is great.

1036
00:41:57,536 --> 00:42:01,796 A:middle
And the third is if you are like
my team, we recently switched

1037
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1038
00:42:01,796 --> 00:42:03,666 A:middle
to Git and we're a little
branch happy right now

1039
00:42:03,766 --> 00:42:05,026 A:middle
so we branch for everything.

1040
00:42:05,506 --> 00:42:08,806 A:middle
And if you branch a lot then
bots are a perfect candidate

1041
00:42:08,806 --> 00:42:09,356 A:middle
for branching.

1042
00:42:09,796 --> 00:42:12,646 A:middle
They're so light weight and
it's a great way to continue

1043
00:42:12,646 --> 00:42:13,536 A:middle
to reap the benefits

1044
00:42:13,536 --> 00:42:15,256 A:middle
of Continuous Integration
while you're using a

1045
00:42:15,256 --> 00:42:16,186 A:middle
branching workflow.

1046
00:42:16,696 --> 00:42:18,346 A:middle
So when you cut yourself
a branch for a feature,

1047
00:42:18,486 --> 00:42:20,566 A:middle
create yourself a bunch of
bots and you're ready to go.

1048
00:42:21,516 --> 00:42:27,936 A:middle
[ Applause ]

1049
00:42:28,436 --> 00:42:31,406 A:middle
So the next question is, how
do you get these features?

1050
00:42:31,406 --> 00:42:33,596 A:middle
And I'm guessing a lot
of you have already gone

1051
00:42:33,596 --> 00:42:35,756 A:middle
and figured this out but let's
go through it just in case.

1052
00:42:36,436 --> 00:42:39,486 A:middle
So the best way is to go to
developer.apple.com today

1053
00:42:39,486 --> 00:42:41,036 A:middle
and you're going to
need three things.

1054
00:42:42,136 --> 00:42:45,306 A:middle
The first thing is you
will need the preview list

1055
00:42:45,306 --> 00:42:47,196 A:middle
of OS X Mavericks.

1056
00:42:48,026 --> 00:42:50,556 A:middle
After that, you'll need the
preview the list of OS X Server

1057
00:42:50,556 --> 00:42:52,946 A:middle
and OS X Server requires
some of the technologies

1058
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:55,536 A:middle
that shipping is part of
OS X Mavericks so you need

1059
00:42:55,536 --> 00:42:57,176 A:middle
to be running server
on a Mavericks machine.

1060
00:42:58,746 --> 00:43:01,616 A:middle
And after that, you need to
get yourself a copy of Xcode 5

1061
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1062
00:43:01,616 --> 00:43:05,356 A:middle
and Xcode 5 will run happily
on Mountain Lion and Mavericks

1063
00:43:05,406 --> 00:43:07,826 A:middle
and Xcode 5 will also run
happily on the same machine

1064
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:09,616 A:middle
or a separate machine from
the server if you want

1065
00:43:09,616 --> 00:43:11,376 A:middle
to run a bot server locally,
that's perfectly fine.

1066
00:43:13,536 --> 00:43:17,426 A:middle
After that, you can join
your existing ADC teams today

1067
00:43:17,426 --> 00:43:20,376 A:middle
if you're a team agent or
team admin with no changes.

1068
00:43:20,406 --> 00:43:21,976 A:middle
Just enter your Apple
ID and password,

1069
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:24,096 A:middle
your server will join your team
and everything is set to go.

1070
00:43:24,096 --> 00:43:28,156 A:middle
And, of course, once
you've done that,

1071
00:43:28,156 --> 00:43:30,156 A:middle
your server will obtain
signing certificates,

1072
00:43:30,196 --> 00:43:31,986 A:middle
special signing certificates
for the server.

1073
00:43:31,986 --> 00:43:34,406 A:middle
Your server will obtain
provisioning profiles

1074
00:43:34,406 --> 00:43:36,646 A:middle
for all the devices that have
been registered for your team

1075
00:43:36,646 --> 00:43:38,646 A:middle
and you can just plug the
devices that you already have

1076
00:43:38,746 --> 00:43:41,036 A:middle
into your server and everything
will be ready and just work.

1077
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:44,156 A:middle
So you can quickly build iOS
projects just by plugging

1078
00:43:44,156 --> 00:43:45,536 A:middle
in devices and entering
your Apple ID.

1079
00:43:48,656 --> 00:43:49,946 A:middle
So, in summary, I hope--

1080
00:43:50,046 --> 00:43:52,876 A:middle
today you've seen that the
Xcode Service and OS X Server

1081
00:43:52,876 --> 00:43:56,546 A:middle
and Xcode 5 is really designed
to help you build better apps.

1082
00:43:56,946 --> 00:44:00,036 A:middle
It's super simple to set up and
once you've set up these bots,

1083
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1084
00:44:00,686 --> 00:44:04,336 A:middle
you can build and you can
catch build issues, errors,

1085
00:44:04,656 --> 00:44:07,206 A:middle
run static analysis regularly
and importantly run your tests

1086
00:44:07,206 --> 00:44:09,906 A:middle
and run your tests on simulators
on the Mac or run your test

1087
00:44:09,906 --> 00:44:12,326 A:middle
in single or multiple threaded
devices to your server.

1088
00:44:13,116 --> 00:44:15,496 A:middle
And the value of a server
is really keeping history

1089
00:44:15,496 --> 00:44:16,396 A:middle
around for your project.

1090
00:44:16,396 --> 00:44:18,356 A:middle
This is not something that
you can feasibly do locally

1091
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:19,966 A:middle
when you're running
Xcode, so being able

1092
00:44:19,966 --> 00:44:22,256 A:middle
to keep all the build logs,
all the build products

1093
00:44:22,476 --> 00:44:24,136 A:middle
and all the results
for your builds back

1094
00:44:24,136 --> 00:44:25,936 A:middle
through time is a really
great asset for your team.

1095
00:44:27,406 --> 00:44:29,746 A:middle
You'll be easily able to
distribute builds to your team

1096
00:44:29,746 --> 00:44:32,406 A:middle
and the integration
with Xcode is amazing.

1097
00:44:32,406 --> 00:44:35,136 A:middle
You'll have fully deep
integration in the IDE

1098
00:44:35,136 --> 00:44:37,416 A:middle
with the Xcode Service
and of course

1099
00:44:37,416 --> 00:44:39,186 A:middle
for everyone who's
not living in Xcode,

1100
00:44:39,186 --> 00:44:41,376 A:middle
there's the web application and
of course there's Scoreboard

1101
00:44:41,376 --> 00:44:43,526 A:middle
for the big screen television
presentation of the stuff.

1102
00:44:46,026 --> 00:44:47,906 A:middle
So there are a couple
of related sessions

1103
00:44:47,906 --> 00:44:50,536 A:middle
that I would highly encourage
you guys to go along and attend.

1104
00:44:50,796 --> 00:44:53,376 A:middle
So later in the week we have
a dedicated testing session

1105
00:44:53,376 --> 00:44:54,366 A:middle
for Xcode 5.

1106
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:55,596 A:middle
We'll be looking at some

1107
00:44:55,596 --> 00:44:57,816 A:middle
of the really great new
testing features including some

1108
00:44:57,816 --> 00:44:59,646 A:middle
of the integration with bots

1109
00:44:59,976 --> 00:45:02,406 A:middle
and also there's a dedicated
source control session later

1110
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1111
00:45:02,406 --> 00:45:03,006 A:middle
in the week too.

1112
00:45:03,286 --> 00:45:06,776 A:middle
So with that, I would like to
thank you for you afternoon

1113
00:45:06,936 --> 00:45:08,176 A:middle
and I hope you have a good week.
