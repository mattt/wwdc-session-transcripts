when I was leaving the

out your chairs, it got real
cool on the sidewalk, I'm sure,

because there are
so many great apps.

22
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:10,186 A:middle

shared a statistic this morning

23
00:01:10,186 --> 00:01:12,246 A:middle
that 70 percent of
the audience here

00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:14,336 A:middle
at WWDC are new to the show.

25
00:01:14,336 --> 00:01:16,296 A:middle
And so many of you
have never been

26
00:01:16,296 --> 00:01:17,726 A:middle
to this show, the design awards.

27
00:01:18,246 --> 00:01:19,846 A:middle
And so we thought
we'd take a moment

28
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,786 A:middle
to explain how we
pick the winners.

29
00:01:22,646 --> 00:01:26,676 A:middle
We judge the winning apps
using sort of three major --

30
00:01:27,056 --> 00:01:29,956 A:middle
we judge the winning apps
in three major areas.

31
00:01:30,296 --> 00:01:32,396 A:middle
The first is around design.

32
00:01:32,986 --> 00:01:35,736 A:middle
So for design, we look
at apps that are --

33
00:01:35,736 --> 00:01:38,226 A:middle
we're looking for apps
that are easy to use.

34
00:01:38,226 --> 00:01:40,406 A:middle
Apps that are familiar.

35
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:43,336 A:middle
That are consistent within
themselves, but consistent

36
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:44,786 A:middle
within the operating
system as well.

37
00:01:45,286 --> 00:01:48,166 A:middle
They have a great game loop,
so really excellent game play.

38
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,846 A:middle
They're intuitive
and understandable

39
00:01:49,846 --> 00:01:53,486 A:middle
and immediately useable by the
people who they were built for.

40
00:01:54,896 --> 00:01:57,966 A:middle
And then we look at apps
in the technology --

41
00:01:58,116 --> 00:01:59,906 A:middle
we judge apps around technology.

43

44
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:04,196 A:middle
So we're evaluating the
apps on their use of iOS

45
00:02:04,276 --> 00:02:07,386 A:middle
or OS X frameworks to
do really cool stuff

46
00:02:07,386 --> 00:02:10,076 A:middle
or to add really
valuable functionality.

47
00:02:10,946 --> 00:02:15,096 A:middle
Or we're also looking at whether
the app launches quickly.

48
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:16,496 A:middle
Is it responsive?

49
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:20,496 A:middle
Does it take, you know, does it
work the way you would expect it

50
00:02:20,496 --> 00:02:21,026 A:middle
to work?

51
00:02:21,026 --> 00:02:23,976 A:middle
And is there smooth scrolling?

52
00:02:24,076 --> 00:02:27,446 A:middle
We look at whether or not the
app runs on the latest OSs,

53
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,216 A:middle
whether it takes advantage
of the newest hardware.

54
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:34,136 A:middle
And takes advantage of
things like M7 or A7 on iOS

55
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:37,426 A:middle
or multicore or other
technologies

56
00:02:37,426 --> 00:02:38,946 A:middle
and hardware technologies
on OS X.

57
00:02:38,946 --> 00:02:43,506 A:middle
And then thirdly, we're
looking at apps from the point

58
00:02:43,506 --> 00:02:44,576 A:middle
of view of innovation.

59
00:02:45,586 --> 00:02:48,976 A:middle
And innovation really is that
spark of brilliance, right,

60
00:02:48,976 --> 00:02:53,796 A:middle
that uniqueness, the clever
implementation of something

61
00:02:53,796 --> 00:02:56,556 A:middle
that you wouldn't have
expected in the first place,

62
00:02:56,556 --> 00:02:59,456 A:middle
but then when you see it,
you're blown away by it.

63
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,946 A:middle
And there's just so many ways
to talk about innovation,

66
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,946 A:middle
And there's just so many ways
to talk about innovation,

67
00:03:02,946 --> 00:03:06,376 A:middle
but really it comes down to
the implementation of something

68
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:10,716 A:middle
that is just so fresh
and so compelling

69
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:12,286 A:middle
and done in a unique way.

70
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:15,456 A:middle
So those three areas are
how we judge the apps.

71
00:03:15,656 --> 00:03:18,876 A:middle
There's so many more things
we look at, but in a nutshell,

72
00:03:18,876 --> 00:03:21,636 A:middle
they're grouped in
those three areas.

73
00:03:22,486 --> 00:03:24,036 A:middle
>> So let's talk
about the prizes

74

"PanoPerfect" is a
fun and simple way

138

to share beautiful
panoramic photos.

139
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:21,936 A:middle
These are two former high school
students that attended WWDC

140
00:06:21,936 --> 00:06:25,616 A:middle
in 2012 on student
scholarships and built this app

141
00:06:25,806 --> 00:06:28,986 A:middle
when they were inspired by our
'06 announcement of panoramics.

142
00:06:29,026 --> 00:06:30,216 A:middle
And John's going to show us now.

143
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:32,896 A:middle
>> Yeah, it's a great story,
sitting in the keynote,

144
00:06:32,956 --> 00:06:35,946 A:middle
watching something, and then
deciding to write an app.

145
00:06:36,116 --> 00:06:39,156 A:middle
I think that's a great story.

146
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:43,206 A:middle
So "PanoPerfect" is
this app that allows you

147
00:06:43,206 --> 00:06:49,166 A:middle
to view panoramic photos, and
it's there's just a community

148
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,976 A:middle
of people who love panoramas

149
00:06:51,086 --> 00:06:54,326 A:middle
that are submitting
photos into the app.

150
00:06:54,496 --> 00:06:56,156 A:middle
So it's a familiar interface.

156
00:07:00,926 --> 00:07:05,156 A:middle
for blurs on some of the UI,
which we'll get to in a moment.

157
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:07,436 A:middle
So this is the explorer,
this is kind

158
00:07:07,436 --> 00:07:09,106 A:middle
of a curated set of panoramas.

159
00:07:09,486 --> 00:07:11,716 A:middle
If we go to nearby
they're using core location

160
00:07:11,716 --> 00:07:12,696 A:middle
to determine where you are.

161
00:07:12,696 --> 00:07:17,236 A:middle
And we're going to go in here,
hopefully, and load some panos.

the creators of the app.

164
00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:25,406 A:middle
But let's just go into
this one: We double tap,

165
00:07:25,896 --> 00:07:28,766 A:middle
you can favorite it, you can
like it, you can comment on it.

166
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:32,476 A:middle
And then you can double tap
and just go in and gesture

167
00:07:32,476 --> 00:07:36,156 A:middle
through the UI to go and
look at the entire panorama.

168
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:41,856 A:middle
And they're doing low res
thumbnails in the feed

169
00:07:41,856 --> 00:07:44,026 A:middle
that you see here,

All right, the next
app was created

182
00:08:21,596 --> 00:08:24,766 A:middle
because of the incredible
movement

183
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:27,346 A:middle

are changing,

we're learning in the classroom.

learning and kids are learning.

00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:41,275 A:middle
And the mix of iPad in
education is really taking off

188

191
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,536 A:middle
saw the growth that was going
on and also saw a specific need

sinister, you know, situation,

219
00:10:01,456 --> 00:10:04,836 A:middle
get into that whole game
play, but these folks worked

220
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:07,616 A:middle
with folks from Sesame Workshop

221
00:10:08,136 --> 00:10:10,496 A:middle
and created some really
great artwork in the app.

222
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:14,116 A:middle
The app is focused on teaching
children basic addition,

223
00:10:14,556 --> 00:10:17,396 A:middle
and for a lot of kids
this is a real struggle.

224
00:10:17,706 --> 00:10:20,966 A:middle
And so this developer set
out to solve this problem.

225
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:22,566 A:middle
So we're going to
get into the app -

226
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:24,986 A:middle
we'll skip over the narrative
at the beginning here.

227
00:10:25,206 --> 00:10:28,056 A:middle
This is pretty straightforward
stuff.

228
00:10:28,056 --> 00:10:29,706 A:middle
So most of you are going
to get the answers right

229
00:10:29,816 --> 00:10:31,396 A:middle
without even using the app.

230
00:10:31,626 --> 00:10:36,816 A:middle
But the key here is that the app
is teaching children addition,

231
00:10:37,176 --> 00:10:40,896 A:middle
and when you're first learning
addition, you just, you know,

232
00:10:40,896 --> 00:10:43,196 A:middle
the first thing you do is you
count on fingers, you just kind

233
00:10:43,196 --> 00:10:45,666 A:middle
of like 1, 2, 3, you count
them off individually.

234
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,556 A:middle
And so the app lets you do that.

235
00:10:47,556 --> 00:10:52,126 A:middle
And so I can just tap,
you know, I got 5,

236
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:53,556 A:middle
I got some feedback in the UI.

237
00:10:53,556 --> 00:10:57,686 A:middle
I move the slider bar with
the tactile fields to 5,

238
00:10:57,766 --> 00:11:00,656 A:middle
and I get confirmation that it's
the right answer, or I don't,

239

240
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

241
00:10:57,766 --> 00:11:00,656 A:middle
and I get confirmation that it's
the right answer, or I don't,

242
00:11:00,696 --> 00:11:01,526 A:middle
it was the wrong answer.

243
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:05,766 A:middle
I can also do count on, which is
a second kind of addition tool.

244
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,946 A:middle
So once the child has
learned to basically count

245
00:11:08,036 --> 00:11:10,186 A:middle
through the numbers,
you know, the numbers,

246
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:13,376 A:middle
then they can start moving on
to different kinds of addition

247
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:15,596 A:middle
where they're going
to take a big number

248
00:11:15,596 --> 00:11:17,276 A:middle
and add some smaller
numbers to it.

249
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:20,666 A:middle
So in this case, the child's
going to start to learn

250
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:24,676 A:middle
that you can start with 3 and
then do 1 more and get 4, right?

251
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:26,816 A:middle
There we go.

252
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:29,286 A:middle
And the app continues to
go on and teach all kinds

253
00:11:29,286 --> 00:11:32,436 A:middle
of other tools and techniques
for learning, addition.

254
00:11:32,656 --> 00:11:35,126 A:middle
Another one is doubles,
where you basically start off

255
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:38,936 A:middle
with say, you know, 3 and 4 is
7, and so first it shows you

256
00:11:38,936 --> 00:11:42,656 A:middle
that you can cut the 4 into a
3 and you get 3, 3, and 1 is 7.

257
00:11:43,146 --> 00:11:44,986 A:middle
The app is full of these
kinds of techniques

258
00:11:44,986 --> 00:11:46,866 A:middle
that take advantage
of iOS technologies

259
00:11:46,936 --> 00:11:50,676 A:middle
to do a really great experience
with large text, great colors,

260
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:53,936 A:middle
and an experience I think that
is really going to resonate

261
00:11:53,936 --> 00:11:54,846 A:middle
with little, little kids.

262
00:11:55,336 --> 00:11:56,396 A:middle

And in the platformer
game, it's a genre,

280
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:59,106 A:middle

basically, you know, running

And the whole point is to not
fall off the platform, right?

288
00:13:11,766 --> 00:13:14,766 A:middle
And the way you fall off the
platform is you get, you know,

289
00:13:15,036 --> 00:13:17,226 A:middle
speared, or some
obstacle hits you,

290

or something falls
on you or whatever.

291
00:13:18,876 --> 00:13:21,726 A:middle
But the point is that the
platform is a pretty loose term,

292
00:13:21,726 --> 00:13:23,246 A:middle
but you're moving
across this thing,

you know, that's super intense.

338
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:28,776 A:middle
But to do this well
takes a lot of design

339
00:15:28,776 --> 00:15:29,996 A:middle
and I think a lot of thinking.

340
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,086 A:middle
And so I want to show you.

341
00:15:31,086 --> 00:15:32,666 A:middle
So the game starts
off like this,

342
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:35,616 A:middle
and the first thing you're told
is where to place your thumbs.

343
00:15:35,886 --> 00:15:38,436 A:middle
And in order to do that,
you're immediately learning how

344
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:39,996 A:middle
to hold the iPad
to play the game.

345
00:15:39,996 --> 00:15:42,436 A:middle
So I'm going to put my left
thumb here, my right thumb here,

346
00:15:42,786 --> 00:15:45,516 A:middle
and now the game starts to work,
and it's got these coach marks.

347
00:15:46,096 --> 00:15:48,096 A:middle
So I'm going to move the left
thumb, and we're going to start

348
00:15:48,096 --> 00:15:50,656 A:middle
to collect coins with Leo here.

349
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:53,626 A:middle
Okay, so here's the
platformer experience, right?

350
00:15:53,626 --> 00:15:57,816 A:middle
You're driving along on this
so-called platform, and boom,

351
00:15:57,816 --> 00:15:59,306 A:middle
I'm stuck, I can't
get over this thing.

352
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,436 A:middle
But this onboarding experience
has these ghosting images,

354

355
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,436 A:middle
But this onboarding experience
has these ghosting images,

356
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:05,066 A:middle
and they tell me that if
I move my right thumb up,

357
00:16:05,246 --> 00:16:08,836 A:middle
I can inflate Leo and
move him up and down.

358
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:12,316 A:middle
And now I'm dealing with
an obstacle in this case.

359
00:16:12,316 --> 00:16:17,286 A:middle
Let's keep going.

360
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:19,886 A:middle
I'm down there, no
problem, I can go back up.

361
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:21,736 A:middle
I can inflate, nope, sorry.

362
00:16:23,206 --> 00:16:23,916 A:middle
Oh come on.

363
00:16:24,286 --> 00:16:26,826 A:middle
This is the problem
with these demos, right?

364
00:16:27,506 --> 00:16:31,416 A:middle
Okay, here we go, we land
on there, boom, ta-da,

365
00:16:31,516 --> 00:16:32,706 A:middle
here we are, we're
driving around.

366
00:16:32,706 --> 00:16:35,736 A:middle
And notice just the
effects in the background.

367
00:16:35,736 --> 00:16:39,556 A:middle
There's this perspective going
on, you've got petals flying

368
00:16:39,556 --> 00:16:42,696 A:middle
through the air, on other
levels there's rain falling,

369
00:16:42,696 --> 00:16:46,156 A:middle
there's all kinds of stuff
happening in the distance.

370
00:16:46,156 --> 00:16:49,446 A:middle
And here, you're dealing
with this obstacle,

371
00:16:49,446 --> 00:16:51,706 A:middle
and the game is full of
these kinds of obstacles,

372
00:16:51,756 --> 00:16:54,636 A:middle
where Leo has to solve - he
has to do something in one spot

373
00:16:54,996 --> 00:16:57,426 A:middle
to open a door or
some kind of a bridge.

374
00:16:57,676 --> 00:16:59,726 A:middle
In this case, if I landed
on top, I would die.

377
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:02,346 A:middle
And so I'm just going to
inflate him, flip this around,

378
00:17:02,686 --> 00:17:05,276 A:middle
and then move along
and keep jumping.

379
00:17:05,276 --> 00:17:08,576 A:middle
And this is just a real
quick view of what's going

380
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:10,586 A:middle
on in this game, but we
just thought they did

381
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:13,465 A:middle
such a good job, for example,
with this kind of an S curve,

382
00:17:13,915 --> 00:17:16,866 A:middle
which is really hard to
get, you know, to do well.

383
00:17:17,386 --> 00:17:19,306 A:middle
You're going down through mines.

384
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:23,506 A:middle
You're in rainstorms,
all kinds of stuff.

385
00:17:23,695 --> 00:17:26,205 A:middle
And then here again, this
onboarding experience,

386
00:17:26,236 --> 00:17:27,606 A:middle
but I'm actually playing it.

387
00:17:27,786 --> 00:17:32,036 A:middle
And you see that I'm supposed
to jump this guy, right, boom.

388
00:17:32,716 --> 00:17:34,386 A:middle
And then now I'm moving along.

389
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,626 A:middle
And this is just
the first level.

390
00:17:36,026 --> 00:17:38,956 A:middle
But the game goes on, and
we just we love this game.

391
00:17:39,376 --> 00:17:42,026 A:middle
For that attention to detail
across all their levels,

392
00:17:42,446 --> 00:17:45,586 A:middle
for the great integration
with touch, for the leveraging

393

of iOS technologies and
graphics, for the sound system,

394
00:17:49,266 --> 00:17:52,796 A:middle
there's so much that these guys
did right, and we just want

395
00:17:52,796 --> 00:17:53,916 A:middle
to say congratulations.

>> All right, we all live busy
lives, and one of the things

402
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:16,156 A:middle
that I've learned over time and
other people have learned is

403
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:19,406 A:middle
that if you can capture some
of the things that are going on

404
00:18:19,406 --> 00:18:24,756 A:middle
and take a moment to record
an idea, a thought, a memory -

405
00:18:25,346 --> 00:18:27,996 A:middle
or something happens and it
triggers a thought and you want

406
00:18:27,996 --> 00:18:32,836 A:middle
to capture it - that that
exercise of writing things

407
00:18:32,836 --> 00:18:36,426 A:middle
down for a moment, to just
capturing these little bits

408
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:39,006 A:middle
of information throughout
the day,

409
00:18:39,096 --> 00:18:40,796 A:middle
is actually a great
way to relieve stress.

410
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:42,826 A:middle
It's actually a great
way to build memories

411
00:18:42,826 --> 00:18:45,296 A:middle
and kind of catalog your day.

412
00:18:45,296 --> 00:18:48,086 A:middle

idea incubator.

00:18:48,526 --> 00:18:52,006 A:middle

it's a good discipline

414

for us all to get into.

415
00:18:53,606 --> 00:18:55,936 A:middle

developer of the next app,

But we thought we'd award it
for the Mac and show it off

437
00:20:04,806 --> 00:20:08,226 A:middle
on the Mac, because so many of
us are so busy as developers,

438
00:20:08,726 --> 00:20:10,586 A:middle
on our Macs every day
- we're writing code,

439
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:14,106 A:middle
we're spending time in Xcode
or we're doing, you know,

440
00:20:14,106 --> 00:20:16,176 A:middle
using various tools, you
could be in a spreadsheet,

441
00:20:16,176 --> 00:20:18,366 A:middle
you could be writing
some sort of a document.

442
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:21,106 A:middle
But along the way,
something might happen -

443
00:20:21,106 --> 00:20:22,796 A:middle
you might get a phone
call, a thought pops

444
00:20:22,796 --> 00:20:24,556 A:middle
into mind, an email arrives.

445
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,176 A:middle
And you might want
to record an idea

446
00:20:27,176 --> 00:20:28,476 A:middle
or put something quickly down,

447
00:20:28,476 --> 00:20:30,016 A:middle
which is a big part
of journaling.

448
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:31,976 A:middle
Not sitting down to
write something huge -

449
00:20:31,976 --> 00:20:33,546 A:middle
it's just capturing
these little nuggets.

450
00:20:34,076 --> 00:20:37,866 A:middle
And so "Day One" just
builds a little menu extra

451
00:20:37,866 --> 00:20:40,346 A:middle
that you can type in and
put some sort of entry in,

452
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:43,516 A:middle
and that'll go straight into the
blog and then into the journal,

453
00:20:43,516 --> 00:20:45,206 A:middle
and then you're back
to your work.

454
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:50,816 A:middle
Or we could just go up here,
and we'll just launch the app,

455
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,886 A:middle
and we can inside of the app,

456
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:54,776 A:middle

I can take - turns out I've
actually taken a trophy picture

464
00:21:16,406 --> 00:21:20,006 A:middle
earlier, so I can take this
picture, drop it into here,

465
00:21:20,006 --> 00:21:22,516 A:middle
and "Day One"'s going to either
take the date from the picture

466
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:24,126 A:middle
or just say leave
it unchanged based

467
00:21:24,126 --> 00:21:25,876 A:middle
on the date I'm answering
this journal entry.

468
00:21:26,356 --> 00:21:29,556 A:middle
And then I say I'm done, I
can tag it with various tags

469
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:31,956 A:middle
that are in the system,
I can add a location,

470
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:33,356 A:middle
they've got maps integration,

471
00:21:33,616 --> 00:21:35,366 A:middle
so I could say use current
location if I'd like.

472
00:21:36,016 --> 00:21:39,266 A:middle
And I'm done, and there's the
entry in there, and I can look

473
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:44,156 A:middle
at my journal over time
using the overall view

474
00:21:44,156 --> 00:21:45,296 A:middle
of all my journal entries.

475
00:21:45,296 --> 00:21:48,936 A:middle
And so here's just a sample
journal that we've got

476
00:21:49,056 --> 00:21:52,396 A:middle
in the app here where you can
take a look at all these entries

477
00:21:52,766 --> 00:21:56,796 A:middle

up when you're going to
create a journal entry

and get you writing.

And really that's the essence
of a great tool, right,

491
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:27,846 A:middle
is that it gets the job done,
it doesn't get in the way,

492

and it's perfectly balanced.

00:23:01,026 --> 00:23:03,616 A:middle
of the principle of
minimalist design.

503
00:23:03,796 --> 00:23:07,126 A:middle
You know, design is all
about fit and finish.

504
00:23:07,726 --> 00:23:10,136 A:middle
It's all about the marriage
between form and function.

505
00:23:10,996 --> 00:23:14,326 A:middle
It's about, you know,
communicating clearly.

506
00:23:14,906 --> 00:23:19,956 A:middle
And iOS really helps
you to do this, right,

507
00:23:19,956 --> 00:23:26,096 A:middle
by helping you focus on
content, getting out of the way,

508
00:23:26,096 --> 00:23:30,526 A:middle
giving you a system that
allows you to draw, you know,

509
00:23:30,526 --> 00:23:34,496 A:middle
the UI from iOS 7 that
is minimalist in nature.

510
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:40,066 A:middle
And, you know, it takes a lot
of attention and a lot of focus

511
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:43,366 A:middle
and refinements to actually
end up with something that is

512
00:23:43,786 --> 00:23:45,846 A:middle
in its purest form,
that is something

513
00:23:45,846 --> 00:23:50,196 A:middle
that is exactly what you wanted
it to be and nothing more,

514
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:51,306 A:middle
there's no extra adornments.

515
00:23:51,566 --> 00:23:53,996 A:middle
And our next winner did
that with their game.

>> Congratulations.

522
00:24:19,256 --> 00:24:21,526 A:middle
The goal of this game is
to shape a line through all

523
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:24,576 A:middle
of the colored circles while
avoiding black holes along

524
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:24,986 A:middle
its route.

525
00:24:25,606 --> 00:24:28,446 A:middle
From delightfully simple to
exceptionally deep and complex,

526
00:24:28,626 --> 00:24:29,956 A:middle
it's a stroke of genius.

John.

528
00:24:31,286 --> 00:24:33,676 A:middle
>> Yeah, this app is awesome.

529
00:24:33,866 --> 00:24:36,686 A:middle
And if you've not
played this game,

530
00:24:36,686 --> 00:24:39,256 A:middle
you need to see it
from the start.

531
00:24:39,636 --> 00:24:42,686 A:middle
So the basic point of the game
is, you know, as Shaan said,

532
00:24:42,686 --> 00:24:46,656 A:middle
you gesture and you draw
this little line to knock

533
00:24:46,726 --> 00:24:49,586 A:middle
out the colored dots, and
when you get to a level

534
00:24:49,586 --> 00:24:51,636 A:middle
where there are black dots,
you want to avoid those.

535
00:24:52,016 --> 00:24:53,236 A:middle
But, you know, at
the first level,

536
00:24:53,236 --> 00:24:56,886 A:middle
you're just starting off
here with this gesture.

537
00:24:57,586 --> 00:25:00,896 A:middle
And you know, notice
as I'm playing here,

538

539
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

540
00:24:57,586 --> 00:25:00,896 A:middle
And you know, notice
as I'm playing here,

541
00:25:00,896 --> 00:25:03,966 A:middle
that there is nothing
extra onscreen,

542
00:25:03,966 --> 00:25:06,746 A:middle
it's just the dots,
it's just my gesture.

543
00:25:07,156 --> 00:25:10,586 A:middle
And the gesture, the rendering
of the gesture is almost

544
00:25:10,586 --> 00:25:15,056 A:middle
like calligraphy, I mean,
it has a flair to it,

545
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:19,746 A:middle
it's representative of the speed
of my stroke, the exact timing,

546
00:25:20,126 --> 00:25:22,336 A:middle
the length and everything.

547
00:25:22,336 --> 00:25:23,496 A:middle
So let me get rid
of these three.

548
00:25:24,326 --> 00:25:25,456 A:middle
So those are easy levels.

549
00:25:25,456 --> 00:25:28,826 A:middle
Let me jump up to level 8 here

550
00:25:28,826 --> 00:25:30,076 A:middle
for a moment, which
is kind of fun.

551
00:25:30,826 --> 00:25:33,016 A:middle
So here I've got an
instance where I've got

552
00:25:33,016 --> 00:25:35,306 A:middle
to avoid the black dots
but get the white ones -

553
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:36,486 A:middle
or get the colored ones.

554
00:25:36,486 --> 00:25:39,466 A:middle
And to do that I've got to
figure out what gesture to do

555
00:25:39,466 --> 00:25:41,786 A:middle
that will repeat
across the screen

556
00:25:41,786 --> 00:25:43,386 A:middle
to remove these colored dots.

557
00:25:43,746 --> 00:25:46,236 A:middle
Now, the other thing that's
super cool about this app is

558
00:25:46,236 --> 00:25:49,776 A:middle
that it leverages audio
for great feedback.

559
00:25:50,086 --> 00:25:56,426 A:middle
And so there's some very
fun, lightweight, you know,

560
00:25:56,426 --> 00:26:02,776 A:middle
sounds that come through
as you screw up, basically.

sounds that come through
as you screw up, basically.

564
00:26:05,246 --> 00:26:06,696 A:middle
You know, so here
I'm messing up.

565
00:26:06,696 --> 00:26:07,986 A:middle
Let me try to do it right.

566
00:26:08,886 --> 00:26:14,486 A:middle
Not quite, not quite, not quite.

567
00:26:15,046 --> 00:26:18,186 A:middle
And the thing about this
game is it's like that.

568
00:26:18,186 --> 00:26:20,526 A:middle
You're like "Oh blast," and
the sound just gives you this

569
00:26:20,636 --> 00:26:21,866 A:middle
great feedback.

570
00:26:21,866 --> 00:26:24,216 A:middle
One last try.

571
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:29,536 A:middle
No, come on, John.

572
00:26:31,116 --> 00:26:33,276 A:middle
Okay, I give up.

573
00:26:33,276 --> 00:26:36,386 A:middle
That's the problem
with these demos.

574
00:26:36,736 --> 00:26:39,086 A:middle
Yeah, we love this game
for the minimalist design,

575
00:26:39,136 --> 00:26:43,106 A:middle
the great integration with the
touch, you know, system of iOS,

576
00:26:43,106 --> 00:26:47,956 A:middle
just that expression of
just a great engagement,

577
00:26:47,956 --> 00:26:51,736 A:middle
this great expression of the
game in a very simplistic way

578
00:26:51,906 --> 00:26:53,556 A:middle
with no extra adornment.

579
00:26:53,556 --> 00:26:56,276 A:middle

at the conference this

for a lack of news sources,

598

it's just that there's so
much news coming at us.

599
00:27:54,616 --> 00:27:59,136 A:middle

a quality source of news.

what you are really interested

in, in the length that
you want it to be in.

look at "Yahoo!

News Digest."

627
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:36,606 A:middle
So what you get is these
two digests of news

628
00:29:36,606 --> 00:29:39,816 A:middle
with about eight stories in
them in the morning at 8 a.m.

629
00:29:40,226 --> 00:29:43,926 A:middle
and at 6 p.m. in the
evening, and that's it.

630
00:29:44,286 --> 00:29:47,186 A:middle
And so this is one of my
go-to news apps all the time.

631
00:29:47,276 --> 00:29:50,276 A:middle
I wait for these digests to
arrive, and once they arrive,

632
00:29:50,636 --> 00:29:54,976 A:middle
you can just scroll through
this really simple UI,

633
00:29:55,756 --> 00:29:58,166 A:middle
that lists the stories, the
top stories, of the day.

634
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:01,886 A:middle
And what they've done really
well is they've, you know,

637
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:01,886 A:middle
And what they've done really
well is they've, you know,

638
00:30:01,886 --> 00:30:05,386 A:middle
done this automatic collection
of information and aggregation

639
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,856 A:middle
and all the work that they do
behind the scenes [inaudible],

640
00:30:08,136 --> 00:30:10,606 A:middle
but then they're doing human
curation of the content

641
00:30:10,926 --> 00:30:12,256 A:middle
in addition with their editors.

642
00:30:12,256 --> 00:30:15,036 A:middle
And so the content that you get,

643
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:19,106 A:middle
the news stories are
extremely high quality.

644
00:30:19,606 --> 00:30:22,006 A:middle
So here we are, we're
moving through this list,

645
00:30:22,006 --> 00:30:23,816 A:middle
and you see a political story,

646
00:30:23,816 --> 00:30:26,806 A:middle
there's a U.S. news
story, technology, world.

647
00:30:27,156 --> 00:30:31,126 A:middle
Below each of these story
headlines you've got these

648
00:30:31,126 --> 00:30:34,596 A:middle
little atoms, these little
circles, and you can tap them

649
00:30:34,596 --> 00:30:36,596 A:middle
to get the legend of
what each of these mean,

650
00:30:36,816 --> 00:30:38,976 A:middle
but basically they're telling
you how much information there

651
00:30:38,976 --> 00:30:40,366 A:middle
is available for
one of the stories.

652
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:43,636 A:middle
So let's go into the story
about Apple - hey, why not?

653
00:30:43,636 --> 00:30:46,716 A:middle
And you know, the first
time you use it, it says,

654
00:30:46,716 --> 00:30:49,746 A:middle
how to use the app, and so you
can swipe just right to left

655
00:30:50,286 --> 00:30:53,496 A:middle
around the stories, or
go back into a story

656
00:30:53,496 --> 00:30:56,036 A:middle
and read it in more detail.

657
00:30:56,036 --> 00:30:58,666 A:middle
And I find that these are,
you know, if I just take

658
00:30:58,666 --> 00:31:01,206 A:middle
about 10 minutes to plow
through this digest,

659

660

661
00:30:58,666 --> 00:31:01,206 A:middle
about 10 minutes to plow
through this digest,

662
00:31:01,206 --> 00:31:04,696 A:middle
I've got some great information
about the latest headlines.

663
00:31:05,076 --> 00:31:07,566 A:middle
And so you get these great
call-outs, you're moving

664
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:09,316 A:middle
through the stories,
that's pretty much it.

665
00:31:09,316 --> 00:31:10,216 A:middle
It's well laid out.

666
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:13,586 A:middle
At the bottom you're getting
extra information like photos

667
00:31:13,586 --> 00:31:15,536 A:middle
that might be associated with
this story, that are coming

668
00:31:15,536 --> 00:31:16,756 A:middle
from really good sources.

669
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,926 A:middle
There might be a
topic breakdown.

670
00:31:19,196 --> 00:31:21,376 A:middle
There might be a video that
loads very, very quickly

671
00:31:21,376 --> 00:31:23,866 A:middle
that it's a quick
summary of the story.

672
00:31:24,026 --> 00:31:27,116 A:middle
There's maps integration,
if it's appropriate.

673
00:31:27,116 --> 00:31:30,186 A:middle
And then you can go
through some top tweets

674
00:31:30,786 --> 00:31:34,246 A:middle
or other social networking
posts that apply to this story.

675
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:38,366 A:middle
And so that's how each of
the stories is laid out,

676
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:41,606 A:middle
and so you just flip through
them one by one, and read them,

677
00:31:41,856 --> 00:31:43,706 A:middle
some really great
visual effects and kind

678
00:31:43,706 --> 00:31:45,426 A:middle
of a playful UI in the app.

679
00:31:46,256 --> 00:31:48,906 A:middle
Another example of playful
UI is the share button.

680
00:31:48,906 --> 00:31:50,836 A:middle
These guys kind of pop up from
the bottom and then they kind

681
00:31:50,836 --> 00:31:52,246 A:middle
of bounce and go away.

682
00:31:52,686 --> 00:31:56,396 A:middle
So really great experience,
and then when you're done,

689
00:32:04,406 --> 00:32:05,956 A:middle
through this and the
news is really great,

690
00:32:05,956 --> 00:32:07,706 A:middle
but they've done a
great job of kind

691
00:32:07,706 --> 00:32:11,096 A:middle
of just gamifying this a little
bit by giving you feedback

692
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,596 A:middle
on how many of the stories they
just sent you that you read.

693
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:15,736 A:middle
And so while we just
swiped through them now,

694
00:32:15,736 --> 00:32:18,236 A:middle
it doesn't mean we read them,
but in theory you've read them,

695
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,026 A:middle
and at the end you
just get told, hey,

696
00:32:20,026 --> 00:32:21,016 A:middle
you've read seven of nine.

697
00:32:21,526 --> 00:32:25,446 A:middle
And I just find that kind
of a cool bit of feedback.

Now, this digest
that we're looking

699
00:32:28,076 --> 00:32:29,586 A:middle
at right here has
a black background

700
00:32:29,586 --> 00:32:31,796 A:middle
because it's the
end of day digest.

701
00:32:31,796 --> 00:32:33,966 A:middle
But we can tap the
top right-hand corner,

702
00:32:34,316 --> 00:32:37,146 A:middle
see the next digest
is coming in 11 hours.

703
00:32:37,146 --> 00:32:38,766 A:middle
If I tap the center of
the screen, it says,

704
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:40,406 A:middle
"Patience is a virtue."

705
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:42,736 A:middle
I loved that the
first time I saw that.

706
00:32:42,736 --> 00:32:44,886 A:middle
And I can go back
across the last week

707
00:32:45,206 --> 00:32:48,496 A:middle
and pick one maybe a
digest that I hadn't read,

708
00:32:48,496 --> 00:32:52,656 A:middle
so I'll pick a morning digest,
and here the news comes in

709
00:32:52,656 --> 00:32:54,306 A:middle
and it's the white background.

710
00:32:54,826 --> 00:32:57,906 A:middle
So little bits of attention
to detail, little attention

And we're always talking
with the developer community

about the need to create
something that is really great,

And one of the ways to create a
really great game is of course

729
00:33:56,436 --> 00:33:58,946 A:middle
to use technology, have a

had really great personality,

"Threes!" is a tiny puzzle

Hey. And you can see on
the front of these tiles

779
00:36:16,456 --> 00:36:18,726 A:middle
that they're, you know,
there's two eyes, there's a nose

780
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:22,496 A:middle
or a mouth, the tiles
are constantly, you know,

781
00:36:22,496 --> 00:36:26,736 A:middle
they're blinking, they're
doing things with their face,

782
00:36:26,736 --> 00:36:28,416 A:middle
they're connecting
up with each other.

783
00:36:28,416 --> 00:36:30,956 A:middle
So the game is, you know,
you're doing ones and twos

784
00:36:30,956 --> 00:36:34,076 A:middle
to create threes and then you
can combine threes together.

We've got to start playing here.

787
00:36:37,836 --> 00:36:42,066 A:middle
So we can combine one and
two with three, threes,

00:36:42,476 --> 00:36:46,316 A:middle
combining the sixes,
right, threes here, right.

00:39:19,306 --> 00:39:21,246 A:middle
you know, got a big footprint,

837
00:39:21,246 --> 00:39:24,236 A:middle
it's got to be brought
down, it takes bandwidth.

838
00:39:24,526 --> 00:39:27,806 A:middle
And so, you know, there's
a better way to do this,

839
00:39:27,806 --> 00:39:28,936 A:middle
as far as these guys
are concerned,

840
00:39:28,936 --> 00:39:30,646 A:middle
they built this tool
that's optimized

841
00:39:30,696 --> 00:39:34,546 A:middle
to create something they're
calling Flixels or Cinemagraphs,

842
00:39:34,546 --> 00:39:37,536 A:middle
which are basically living
images that are a combination

843
00:39:37,536 --> 00:39:39,216 A:middle
of a photo and a video.

844
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:42,776 A:middle
And they benefit from being
a whole lot more lightweight

845
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:46,926 A:middle
than video and a lot more
interesting and compelling

846
00:39:47,126 --> 00:39:49,586 A:middle
than photos, just still photos.

847
00:39:49,586 --> 00:39:53,796 A:middle
So what I want to do
here is show you first

848
00:39:53,796 --> 00:39:56,456 A:middle
of all just an animated gif --

849
00:39:56,556 --> 00:40:00,176 A:middle
gif, sorry, animated gif that
I'm going to create in a moment,

850

851
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

852
00:39:56,556 --> 00:40:00,176 A:middle
gif, sorry, animated gif that
I'm going to create in a moment,

853
00:40:00,676 --> 00:40:03,646 A:middle
and now this is sort of an
old file format on the Web,

854
00:40:03,646 --> 00:40:04,706 A:middle
but it's still prevalent.

855
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:07,616 A:middle
And to create one of
these is difficult

856
00:40:07,616 --> 00:40:09,706 A:middle
to do what we're going
to do in a minute.

857
00:40:09,706 --> 00:40:11,226 A:middle
And so here's an animated gif.

858
00:40:11,466 --> 00:40:12,706 A:middle
And we're going to
end up with that,

859
00:40:12,706 --> 00:40:16,476 A:middle
and that started
with this raw video.

860
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:22,166 A:middle
So this is just video taken
in a subway in New York.

861
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:24,356 A:middle
And we're going to start
with that and quickly

862
00:40:24,356 --> 00:40:27,706 A:middle
in like three steps
create the animated gif

863
00:40:27,706 --> 00:40:28,586 A:middle
and create a Flixel.

864
00:40:28,586 --> 00:40:32,606 A:middle
So let me switch over
to "Cinemagraph Pro."

865
00:40:33,106 --> 00:40:38,356 A:middle
Now, what you do is you open up
the raw video that you've got,

866
00:40:38,356 --> 00:40:40,936 A:middle
and in this case we've got
somebody walking by on the left,

867
00:40:40,936 --> 00:40:43,486 A:middle
we've got the train
coming in here.

868
00:40:43,486 --> 00:40:45,396 A:middle
If you just look to the
left of the escalator,

869
00:40:45,396 --> 00:40:48,096 A:middle
you'll see as this loops,
the train's pulling in,

870
00:40:48,486 --> 00:40:50,526 A:middle
and there's the light,
and it stops, right.

871
00:40:50,526 --> 00:40:51,516 A:middle
So it's a very short clip.

872
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:53,866 A:middle
But we don't want any of
those noise on the side,

873
00:40:53,866 --> 00:40:55,656 A:middle
we don't want any of the
reflection from the lights

874
00:40:55,656 --> 00:40:58,106 A:middle
and different things that are
in the station on the walls.

875
00:40:58,536 --> 00:41:01,166 A:middle
And so we start in the top
left corner we choose trim,

876

877
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

878
00:40:58,536 --> 00:41:01,166 A:middle
And so we start in the top
left corner we choose trim,

879
00:41:02,006 --> 00:41:04,616 A:middle
we pull in the trim, and
we figure out exactly,

880
00:41:04,616 --> 00:41:07,736 A:middle
you notice the lady on the left,
we decide where we want her

881
00:41:07,736 --> 00:41:10,416 A:middle
to freeze in the image
that we're going to create

882
00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:12,406 A:middle
or in the Cinemagraph that
we're going to create,

883
00:41:12,406 --> 00:41:14,526 A:middle
and we stop it there with
the left side of the trim.

884
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,916 A:middle
The right side of the trim,
I'm just going to pull in here

885
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:20,026 A:middle
and adjust just slightly
so I get the light

886
00:41:20,116 --> 00:41:21,496 A:middle
from the train coming
in to the left

887
00:41:21,496 --> 00:41:23,146 A:middle
of the escalator
there, you see that?

888
00:41:23,476 --> 00:41:24,436 A:middle
It's in there.

889
00:41:24,436 --> 00:41:26,626 A:middle
So that's just pulling
it in for the right side.

890
00:41:26,626 --> 00:41:28,926 A:middle
And then next is where
the magic happens.

891
00:41:28,926 --> 00:41:29,906 A:middle
I'm going to go to
the mask tool,

892
00:41:29,906 --> 00:41:32,806 A:middle
it's a little bit too big here,
so I'm going to adjust its size.

893
00:41:33,286 --> 00:41:38,556 A:middle
Go down and I'm going to
mask the portion of the image

894
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,526 A:middle
that of the video
that I want to keep,

895
00:41:40,526 --> 00:41:44,336 A:middle
everything else now becomes
basically masked out.

896
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:48,336 A:middle
And then I'm going to go to loop
and decide what kind of a loop,

897
00:41:48,336 --> 00:41:50,516 A:middle
I've got several types
of loops that I can do.

898
00:41:50,646 --> 00:41:51,856 A:middle
I'll just stick with repeat.

899
00:41:52,356 --> 00:41:55,416 A:middle
I'm going to, you know, leave
the speed the way it is.

900
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:57,716 A:middle
Leave the lay the way it is.

901
00:41:57,716 --> 00:41:58,926 A:middle
And just increase crossfade.

902
00:41:58,926 --> 00:42:01,136 A:middle
Crossfade is what happens
when the video ends

903

904
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

905
00:41:58,926 --> 00:42:01,136 A:middle
Crossfade is what happens
when the video ends

906
00:42:01,136 --> 00:42:03,216 A:middle
and then it loops
back to the beginning.

907
00:42:03,716 --> 00:42:05,176 A:middle
So we'll just make
that smooth so it looks

908
00:42:05,176 --> 00:42:07,056 A:middle
like a continuous
movement of the escalator.

909
00:42:07,446 --> 00:42:11,256 A:middle
And lastly, we'll go to look
quickly at adjustments -

910
00:42:11,256 --> 00:42:14,806 A:middle
I can adjust all kinds of
the attributes on this video.

911
00:42:14,806 --> 00:42:17,416 A:middle
But I'll just go to the
canned effects that are here,

912
00:42:17,696 --> 00:42:20,416 A:middle
and you can see that you can
apply these super quickly

913
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:23,066 A:middle
to this image.

914
00:42:23,896 --> 00:42:27,016 A:middle
And so let's grab black
and white cold sun,

915
00:42:27,466 --> 00:42:30,726 A:middle
and then we'll do a
render, and we can save it

916
00:42:30,726 --> 00:42:35,586 A:middle
out as [inaudible] or pro
res 422, so we'll do that,

917
00:42:36,586 --> 00:42:37,886 A:middle
save it to the desktop.

918
00:42:38,136 --> 00:42:39,786 A:middle
Let's call it demo.

919
00:42:40,186 --> 00:42:45,376 A:middle
And what it's creating now is
it's creating this Flixel file,

920
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:49,716 A:middle
this cinemagraph that the folks
at "Cinemagraph Pro" sorry

921
00:42:49,716 --> 00:42:52,526 A:middle
at Flixel can host on
their servers for you,

922
00:42:52,806 --> 00:42:55,306 A:middle
and it's super lightweight,
comes down,

923

gives you that exact experience.

works with every browser, and
gives you that exact experience.

927
00:43:00,596 --> 00:43:04,376 A:middle
And so the end result is
basically this, you know,

928
00:43:04,376 --> 00:43:07,516 A:middle
you can see that the woman
on the left is frozen,

929
00:43:07,516 --> 00:43:09,106 A:middle
everything about
the scene is frozen,

930
00:43:09,206 --> 00:43:10,946 A:middle
except the one piece
that we want.

931
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:12,976 A:middle

simple steps.

932
00:43:13,636 --> 00:43:19,546 A:middle

933
00:43:19,546 --> 00:43:21,026 A:middle
it's really streamlined.

934
00:43:21,026 --> 00:43:24,726 A:middle
It does one thing extremely
well, saving you 30 steps

935
00:43:24,726 --> 00:43:28,666 A:middle
in other tools, and they
have a really great model

936

serving them out to your site.

of that spark of brilliance.

953

It's that ingredient
that if an app has it,

jaw drop, right.

they'll become louder and

the moment doesn't do anything.

that makes it really

you can just pinch

1122
00:52:28,536 --> 00:52:31,186 A:middle
Let me go into one
that's got some video,

1123
00:52:31,186 --> 00:52:32,476 A:middle
so let's go into this story

by a photojournalist
who went to Rwanda.

1125
00:52:36,446 --> 00:52:39,436 A:middle
And so this one's got, you
know, much larger photos,

1126
00:52:39,536 --> 00:52:42,516 A:middle
a lot more texts, these
individual portraits.

1127
00:52:43,006 --> 00:52:45,186 A:middle
And quickly here we're
going to get to a video,

1128
00:52:45,436 --> 00:52:47,146 A:middle
just embedded right in,
you don't have to tap

1129
00:52:47,396 --> 00:52:49,516 A:middle
to start playing the
video, it just does

1130
00:52:50,086 --> 00:52:54,096 A:middle
as it pulls the majority
of it onscreen, right.

1131
00:52:54,096 --> 00:52:55,206 A:middle
You keep reading.

1132
00:52:55,476 --> 00:52:57,836 A:middle
Again, it's a much more

and families are creating them,
individuals are creating them.

1140
00:53:11,766 --> 00:53:16,336 A:middle
So one of the things about this
app is it lets you create one

1141
00:53:16,336 --> 00:53:20,876 A:middle
of these books or these
stories sorry super easily.

So you just tap the
create button.

1143
00:53:22,746 --> 00:53:24,716 A:middle
We're going to add
from the photo library.

1144
00:53:24,756 --> 00:53:30,626 A:middle
Let's say we went to the lake,
we import these 14 images,

1145
00:53:31,036 --> 00:53:34,676 A:middle
and immediately they're
laid out in the format

1146

that the app provides.

1147
00:53:36,466 --> 00:53:45,286 A:middle
So let's say, you know, trip
to the lake, great memories,

1148
00:53:45,796 --> 00:53:49,946 A:middle
and we say done on that.

1149
00:53:50,236 --> 00:53:54,196 A:middle
Okay, so now we're
down in the basic view,

1150
00:53:54,196 --> 00:53:56,466 A:middle
which is thumbnail view, but
it's like I want to do more

1151
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:57,956 A:middle
than this, I want to
make something compelling

1158
00:54:05,016 --> 00:54:07,786 A:middle

drag, make that larger.

1159
00:54:07,956 --> 00:54:10,876 A:middle
This one of her on the
tree stump is pretty cool,

1160
00:54:10,876 --> 00:54:12,296 A:middle
so we can just tap
and drag that.

1161
00:54:12,296 --> 00:54:16,806 A:middle
We can double tap and you know,
and crop it in the way we want.

1162
00:54:17,376 --> 00:54:19,646 A:middle
Go around, make something
really big, like this,

1163
00:54:19,646 --> 00:54:21,476 A:middle
everything else moves

"Monument Valley" is
a surreal exploration

1330
01:02:57,186 --> 01:02:58,796 A:middle
through fantastical
architectures

Guide the silent Princess Ida
through mysterious monuments,

1336
01:03:03,936 --> 01:03:06,866 A:middle
uncovering hidden paths and
unfolding optical illusions

1337
01:03:07,156 --> 01:03:09,346 A:middle
to outsmart the enigmatic
crow people.

01:03:13,996 --> 01:03:16,416 A:middle
>> This is such an awesome game.

1339
01:03:16,416 --> 01:03:19,356 A:middle
And I don't know where
the idea came from,

1340
01:03:19,676 --> 01:03:23,146 A:middle
we'll have to hear the
story someday, but it is -

1341
01:03:23,416 --> 01:03:26,026 A:middle
they just set out to
do something so big

1342
01:03:26,026 --> 01:03:27,636 A:middle
and the result is amazing.

1343
01:03:27,706 --> 01:03:30,536 A:middle
So what you're doing is you're
taking this little Princess Ida

1344
01:03:30,536 --> 01:03:33,066 A:middle
and you've got to get her to
the top of these, you know,

1345
01:03:33,146 --> 01:03:34,316 A:middle
to the top of the scenes.

1346
01:03:34,316 --> 01:03:35,936 A:middle
In this case the top
of the tower there.

1347
01:03:35,936 --> 01:03:40,016 A:middle
But we're looking at this
very Escheresque 3-D model,

1348
01:03:40,246 --> 01:03:41,726 A:middle
and a lot of things
don't line up.

1349
01:03:42,066 --> 01:03:44,876 A:middle
Anyway, so we'll
figure it out as we go.

1350
01:03:45,386 --> 01:03:48,576 A:middle
No. 1, you know, you can
interact with objects onscreen.

1351
01:03:48,576 --> 01:03:50,566 A:middle
So this one's pretty
straightforward - let's just tap

1352
01:03:50,566 --> 01:03:51,756 A:middle
and tell her where to go.

1353
01:03:52,466 --> 01:03:55,156 A:middle
She's going to go up here,
we're going to put her up here.

1354
01:03:55,156 --> 01:03:56,676 A:middle
But now, now what do we do?

1355
01:03:57,166 --> 01:04:01,716 A:middle
But you get these hints onscreen
that so you can turn this

But you get these hints onscreen
that so you can turn this

1359
01:04:02,246 --> 01:04:06,156 A:middle
and so we'll walk around here,
we're going to walk her around,

1360
01:04:06,256 --> 01:04:09,266 A:middle
flip this around, and now
she's got to go and step

1361
01:04:09,266 --> 01:04:11,276 A:middle
on this special platform,
which is now going

1362
01:04:11,276 --> 01:04:13,236 A:middle
to deconstruct things.

1363
01:04:13,746 --> 01:04:16,346 A:middle
But you know, when you
look at this, okay,

1364
01:04:16,346 --> 01:04:17,326 A:middle
now where's she going to go?

1365
01:04:17,326 --> 01:04:19,966 A:middle
She can't climb that
center pole.

1366
01:04:19,966 --> 01:04:22,646 A:middle
She can't you know,
what are we going to do?

1367
01:04:22,646 --> 01:04:28,586 A:middle
But what's just so cool about
this app is that once you start

1368
01:04:28,586 --> 01:04:30,126 A:middle
to interact with these objects,

1369
01:04:30,796 --> 01:04:34,486 A:middle
you realize like look what's
going on here, you didn't think

1370
01:04:34,486 --> 01:04:36,946 A:middle
that that top bar
was the same height

1371
01:04:36,946 --> 01:04:38,226 A:middle
as the other walkway, right.

1372
01:04:38,766 --> 01:04:40,286 A:middle
But as you start to
rotate it around,

1373
01:04:40,286 --> 01:04:46,356 A:middle
they've just done this great job
of showing what you're doing.

you know, those stairs

1376
01:04:52,726 --> 01:04:55,316 A:middle
that just never end, right,
it's exactly that experience.

1377
01:04:55,786 --> 01:04:58,486 A:middle
So here you turn around,
now she's going to get

1378
01:04:58,486 --> 01:05:00,926 A:middle
to the final destination, right.

to the final destination, right.

1382
01:05:01,026 --> 01:05:04,376 A:middle
And so she gets there, we
get this path that appears,

1383
01:05:04,946 --> 01:05:07,086 A:middle
and now we get onto
this next level.

1384
01:05:07,086 --> 01:05:10,076 A:middle
So she's going to
walk around here.

1385

And this just goes
on and on and on.

1386
01:05:13,166 --> 01:05:17,286 A:middle
And it's just so awesome,
because in this level here,

1387
01:05:17,286 --> 01:05:20,366 A:middle
she suddenly learns to
walk sideways and walk

1388
01:05:20,366 --> 01:05:21,276 A:middle
on different surfaces.

1389
01:05:21,276 --> 01:05:24,096 A:middle
So here she's going up here.

1390
01:05:24,156 --> 01:05:25,926 A:middle
We're going to walk
her around here.

1391

soundtrack that's going

happening here, right?

can I remember how to do this?

demo there because - oh,

what to do, that's right.
