1
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:14,716 A:middle
>> Good morning.

2
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:18,846 A:middle
And welcome to WWDC
session on iAd Workbench.

3
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:22,726 A:middle
I'm Paresh Rajwat and I'm
here with my colleague,

4
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:26,616 A:middle
Ravi Chittari, to share with
you how we're evolving the iAd

5
00:00:26,616 --> 00:00:27,626 A:middle
Workbench platform.

6
00:00:28,116 --> 00:00:31,576 A:middle
We have some awesome stuff we
are bringing to you this fall,

7
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:33,656 A:middle
and I can't wait to
share it with you.

8
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:37,996 A:middle
But before we go there, knowing
some of you are probably new

9
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:41,406 A:middle
to advertising, and perhaps
hearing the word iAd Workbench

10
00:00:41,406 --> 00:00:42,236 A:middle
for the first time.

11
00:00:43,046 --> 00:00:45,426 A:middle
Let's start with two
foundational questions.

12
00:00:46,626 --> 00:00:47,576 A:middle
Why advertise?

13
00:00:49,196 --> 00:00:49,956 A:middle
And why iAd?

14
00:00:49,956 --> 00:00:54,136 A:middle
Let's start with the first
question: why advertise.

15
00:00:54,736 --> 00:00:59,806 A:middle
Say you developed this app, you
put a lot of time and energy

16
00:00:59,806 --> 00:01:04,426 A:middle
in it and you put
it on the App Store.

17

18
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

19
00:00:59,806 --> 00:01:04,426 A:middle
in it and you put
it on the App Store.

20
00:01:04,616 --> 00:01:05,966 A:middle
Now two things can happen.

21
00:01:06,856 --> 00:01:11,526 A:middle
First, users can find
your app, or second,

22
00:01:12,086 --> 00:01:14,506 A:middle
you can find users for your app.

23
00:01:15,126 --> 00:01:18,276 A:middle
Users will find your app
if they know about you,

24
00:01:19,726 --> 00:01:21,336 A:middle
or your app is featured in one

25
00:01:21,336 --> 00:01:24,726 A:middle
of the categories
in the App Store.

26
00:01:24,926 --> 00:01:27,076 A:middle
But with thousands
of apps coming

27
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:30,586 A:middle
on the App Store every
day, natural discovery

28
00:01:30,586 --> 00:01:33,206 A:middle
of your app becomes
increasingly difficult

29
00:01:33,936 --> 00:01:35,986 A:middle
and you don't have
much control on it.

30
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:39,136 A:middle
So what can you do
to take more control

31
00:01:39,496 --> 00:01:43,436 A:middle
of the success of your app?

32
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:44,776 A:middle
You can advertise.

33
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:49,036 A:middle
When you advertise, you
can find the right users

34
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:50,716 A:middle
that will make the difference.

35
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:56,116 A:middle
And when it comes to advertising
your apps or your products

36
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,786 A:middle
to millions of Apple
costumers around the world,

37

38
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

39
00:02:01,116 --> 00:02:03,376 A:middle
iAd is your best choice.

40
00:02:04,756 --> 00:02:11,316 A:middle
Why? Because iAd is part of
Apple, and we know Apple users,

41
00:02:12,286 --> 00:02:14,036 A:middle
all 800 million of them.

42
00:02:15,146 --> 00:02:18,886 A:middle
We know what apps and other
items content they downloaded

43
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:22,236 A:middle
and we know how and
when they use it.

44
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,966 A:middle
Last June, we introduced
iAd Workbench.

45
00:02:27,886 --> 00:02:31,066 A:middle
It's self-service mobile
advertising platform

46
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:36,186 A:middle
that provides you the simplest
way to promote your product

47
00:02:37,046 --> 00:02:38,846 A:middle
to millions of Apple
users around the world.

48
00:02:39,256 --> 00:02:42,496 A:middle
Since we introduced
iAd Workbench,

49
00:02:42,766 --> 00:02:44,906 A:middle
we have successfully
helped developers,

50
00:02:46,076 --> 00:02:50,056 A:middle
many of them advertising for the
very first time, drive millions

51
00:02:50,056 --> 00:02:52,706 A:middle
of visits to their
iTunes product pages.

52
00:02:54,026 --> 00:02:56,906 A:middle
iAd Workbench is
open to everyone.

53
00:02:57,986 --> 00:03:01,506 A:middle
And you can promote
anything using iAd Workbench.

54

55
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

56
00:02:57,986 --> 00:03:01,506 A:middle
And you can promote
anything using iAd Workbench.

57
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,796 A:middle
You can promote your apps.

58
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:08,436 A:middle
You can promote your products,
your brands, your service,

59
00:03:08,436 --> 00:03:11,256 A:middle
including your iTunes content,

60
00:03:11,646 --> 00:03:14,656 A:middle
whether it's music,
books or movies.

61
00:03:15,256 --> 00:03:19,756 A:middle
Last June when we
introduced iAd Workbench,

62
00:03:19,976 --> 00:03:22,266 A:middle
we started in the U.S.
as the first market.

63
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:24,896 A:middle
And then a few months
after that,

64
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,886 A:middle
we expanded internationally.

65
00:03:27,556 --> 00:03:31,136 A:middle
iAd Workbench is now
available in 14 countries

66
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,116 A:middle
and expanding rapidly.

67
00:03:33,686 --> 00:03:37,986 A:middle
Now creating a campaign using
iAd Workbench is very easy.

68
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,536 A:middle
You can create one in
just a few minutes.

69
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:48,036 A:middle
To demonstrate, why don't I have
Ravi show you how easy it is

70
00:03:48,036 --> 00:03:49,446 A:middle
to advertise using
iAd Workbench.

71
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,256 A:middle
>> Thank you, Paresh.

72
00:03:52,456 --> 00:03:53,256 A:middle
Good morning everyone.

73
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:56,206 A:middle
I'm Ravi Chittari from
iAd Engineering team.

74
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,566 A:middle
I'm here to demo iAd Workbench.

75
00:03:58,996 --> 00:04:06,256 A:middle
In this demo, you will see how
easy it is to promote an app.

76

77
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

78
00:03:58,996 --> 00:04:06,256 A:middle
In this demo, you will see how
easy it is to promote an app.

79
00:04:06,506 --> 00:04:10,656 A:middle
During this demo, you will see
several options, but I'm going

80
00:04:10,656 --> 00:04:13,196 A:middle
to focus on a few and
will cover more later.

81
00:04:14,306 --> 00:04:15,786 A:middle
Let's get started.

82
00:04:17,546 --> 00:04:21,666 A:middle
iAd Workbench is accessible
through iadworkbench.apple.com.

83
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:25,846 A:middle
All you need is an
Apple ID to log in.

84
00:04:26,116 --> 00:04:30,026 A:middle
When you log in, the first page
you go to is the Dashboard.

85
00:04:30,996 --> 00:04:32,926 A:middle
Dashboard is a summary
of all the campaigns,

86
00:04:33,896 --> 00:04:35,266 A:middle
and also it gives basic metrics.

87
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:38,156 A:middle
To get into the campaign
creation flow,

88
00:04:38,636 --> 00:04:39,916 A:middle
let's click on Create Campaign.

89
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:47,486 A:middle
The first choice you have is
what do you want to promote?

90
00:04:48,896 --> 00:04:50,316 A:middle
App or a Product?

91
00:04:52,076 --> 00:04:55,096 A:middle
Let's select App.

92
00:04:55,346 --> 00:04:59,256 A:middle
Below are the three apps that
are published to the App Store

93
00:04:59,606 --> 00:05:01,846 A:middle
from my developer account.

94

95
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

96
00:04:59,606 --> 00:05:01,846 A:middle
from my developer account.

97
00:05:01,846 --> 00:05:05,416 A:middle
iAd Workbench automatically gets
all the apps that you published

98
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,786 A:middle
to the App Store and
makes it available here

99
00:05:08,606 --> 00:05:11,666 A:middle
so you can promote
through campaigns.

100
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:13,716 A:middle
Let me select Klara.

101
00:05:13,716 --> 00:05:19,896 A:middle
For a bid type, my goal
is to drive downloads.

102
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,786 A:middle
I'm going to select
CPC, cost per click.

103
00:05:23,246 --> 00:05:26,506 A:middle
Let me name my campaign.

104
00:05:34,136 --> 00:05:37,966 A:middle
Clicking on Next will take
me to step 2, Targeting.

105
00:05:38,826 --> 00:05:40,936 A:middle
Targeting is all about
finding the right audience

106
00:05:40,936 --> 00:05:41,546 A:middle
for your campaign.

107
00:05:41,546 --> 00:05:44,746 A:middle
We have two options,
Auto and Manual.

108
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:49,166 A:middle
In case of Auto, iAd finds
the right audience for you.

109
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,786 A:middle
In case of Manual, you get to
set the targeting preferences.

110
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:55,956 A:middle
Let me set up Auto.

111
00:05:56,176 --> 00:05:57,986 A:middle
Next, country where
your ad is going to run.

112
00:05:58,176 --> 00:06:00,066 A:middle
I'm going to select
United States.

113

114
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

115
00:05:58,176 --> 00:06:00,066 A:middle
I'm going to select
United States.

116
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:05,286 A:middle
Next, Ad. Ad is a combination
of Creative and Destination.

117
00:06:05,876 --> 00:06:08,456 A:middle
I'm going to select
Banner for Creative

118
00:06:09,126 --> 00:06:10,366 A:middle
and Destination: iTunes.

119
00:06:11,676 --> 00:06:15,136 A:middle
iTunes destination refers to
the App Store product page

120
00:06:15,806 --> 00:06:18,796 A:middle
where user can review
the app details

121
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:22,176 A:middle
and download the app
right from there.

122
00:06:22,306 --> 00:06:23,116 A:middle
Next, flight dates.

123
00:06:24,586 --> 00:06:26,646 A:middle
These are the dates during which
your campaign is going to run.

124
00:06:27,556 --> 00:06:30,446 A:middle
The default started is today
and ended is a month from now.

125
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:32,806 A:middle
Let's leave it as is.

126
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:33,826 A:middle
Next, budget.

127
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,166 A:middle
How much money you are willing
to spend on this campaign?

128
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,406 A:middle
Let me enter 2,000 dollars.

129
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:41,996 A:middle
Daily Spend Goal is
automatically calculated.

130
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:47,916 A:middle
CPC Bid: how much you are
willing to pay per click,

131
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:50,506 A:middle
the maximum you're
willing to pay per click.

132
00:06:50,696 --> 00:06:54,546 A:middle
You may enter 50 cents.

133
00:06:54,596 --> 00:06:56,456 A:middle
Let's leave the CPA
Goal optional.

134
00:06:57,646 --> 00:07:01,496 A:middle
Clicking on Calculate will
give us the estimated number

135

136
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

137
00:06:57,646 --> 00:07:01,496 A:middle
Clicking on Calculate will
give us the estimated number

138
00:07:01,496 --> 00:07:04,726 A:middle
of impressions and tabs.

139
00:07:04,726 --> 00:07:08,516 A:middle
If you want to see more
impressions and tabs,

140
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,526 A:middle
you can change the combination
of targeting, budget,

141
00:07:11,526 --> 00:07:17,056 A:middle
and bid, and you'll see more.

142
00:07:17,256 --> 00:07:18,586 A:middle
Next, let's name our line.

143
00:07:19,186 --> 00:07:21,876 A:middle
I've used the term "line"
several times in this page.

144
00:07:22,706 --> 00:07:23,216 A:middle
What is line?

145
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:27,576 A:middle
A line is a combination of
targeting, budget, and bid.

146
00:07:27,796 --> 00:07:29,626 A:middle
You can have several
lines in a campaign.

147
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:34,626 A:middle
I'm going to name this
line, My Simple Auto Line.

148
00:07:36,076 --> 00:07:39,756 A:middle
Clicking on Next will take me
to the Targeting Summary page

149
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:41,856 A:middle
where all the lines are listed.

150
00:07:42,356 --> 00:07:44,436 A:middle
For this campaign, we
have just one line.

151
00:07:45,136 --> 00:07:47,626 A:middle
You can always add more lines by
clicking on Create Line button.

152
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:54,226 A:middle
Clicking on Next will take us to
step 3, which is Creating an Ad.

153
00:07:55,336 --> 00:07:57,846 A:middle
The first choice we have
is selecting a device

154
00:07:57,846 --> 00:07:58,876 A:middle
where your ad is going to run.

155
00:07:59,606 --> 00:08:02,726 A:middle
Klara is a universal app,
so the system detected that

156

157
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

158
00:07:59,606 --> 00:08:02,726 A:middle
Klara is a universal app,
so the system detected that

159
00:08:02,726 --> 00:08:05,136 A:middle
and gave iPhone,
iPad on Universal.

160
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:06,556 A:middle
Let's select Universal.

161
00:08:07,716 --> 00:08:09,286 A:middle
For language, let's
stick with English.

162
00:08:09,696 --> 00:08:10,916 A:middle
We have more choices
there as well.

163
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:13,796 A:middle
Then let's define the creative.

164
00:08:14,276 --> 00:08:18,166 A:middle
There are two choices, Using a
Template and From My Desktop.

165
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:23,966 A:middle
From My Desktop is
upload your own Banner.

166
00:08:25,396 --> 00:08:27,366 A:middle
But for now, let's
select templates.

167
00:08:27,366 --> 00:08:31,276 A:middle
We have built several templates
for you to make it easy.

168
00:08:32,196 --> 00:08:36,666 A:middle
As you can see, there
are different formats

169
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:37,466 A:middle
for these templates.

170
00:08:38,546 --> 00:08:39,476 A:middle
Let me select marigold.

171
00:08:42,126 --> 00:08:46,106 A:middle
For title, let's give
the name of the app.

172
00:08:47,046 --> 00:08:50,106 A:middle
And for message, few
words about your app.

173
00:08:52,956 --> 00:08:56,776 A:middle
And for Call to Action, you
have several predefined ones

174
00:08:56,946 --> 00:08:58,626 A:middle
or you can always
enter a custom text.

175
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:00,486 A:middle
I'm going to select
Download Now.

177
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

178
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:00,486 A:middle
I'm going to select
Download Now.

179
00:09:00,776 --> 00:09:06,526 A:middle
And here is the preview of
how your Banner is going

180
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:07,306 A:middle
to look on the device.

181
00:09:08,556 --> 00:09:10,106 A:middle
You can click on View All Sizes

182
00:09:10,746 --> 00:09:14,126 A:middle
to see how we have prepared
this creative for iPhone, iPad,

183
00:09:14,196 --> 00:09:15,056 A:middle
portrait and landscape.

184
00:09:18,896 --> 00:09:19,956 A:middle
That's how simple it is.

185
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:23,056 A:middle
Let's select their
destination, iTunes.

186
00:09:23,056 --> 00:09:29,006 A:middle
As you saw, as soon as I
selected the destination,

187
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:34,886 A:middle
it's pointing to the
Klara iTunes product page.

188
00:09:34,986 --> 00:09:38,056 A:middle
For this ad to go live,
we need to associate this

189
00:09:38,056 --> 00:09:40,316 A:middle
with the line that
we just created.

190
00:09:43,886 --> 00:09:45,056 A:middle
I'm assigning to the line.

191
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:52,476 A:middle
We give that name, Marigold 1.

192
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,686 A:middle
Clicking on Next will take
us to the Ad Summary page

193
00:09:56,316 --> 00:09:57,436 A:middle
where you will see all the ads

194
00:09:57,476 --> 00:09:58,806 A:middle
that are created
for this campaign.

195

196
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

197
00:10:01,526 --> 00:10:03,926 A:middle
And you can always
create more Ads from here

198
00:10:04,496 --> 00:10:05,566 A:middle
by clicking on Create Ad.

199
00:10:06,546 --> 00:10:09,066 A:middle
Clicking on Next will take us
to the Campaign Summary page

200
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:12,946 A:middle
where you can review all
the details in one place.

201
00:10:13,136 --> 00:10:13,896 A:middle
Where you're promoting,

202
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:16,946 A:middle
what you're targeting,
what are your ads.

203
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:20,856 A:middle
In case you have not
set up the payment yet,

204
00:10:21,806 --> 00:10:24,636 A:middle
which is a credit card,
you can always click here,

205
00:10:24,636 --> 00:10:25,816 A:middle
but let's Submit.

206
00:10:25,816 --> 00:10:32,236 A:middle
When you submit, the
creatives are submitted

207
00:10:32,236 --> 00:10:33,966 A:middle
for iAd's Certification review.

208
00:10:34,886 --> 00:10:36,976 A:middle
Once they are approved,
your campaign goes live.

209
00:10:38,716 --> 00:10:39,746 A:middle
That's how simple it is.

210
00:10:40,926 --> 00:10:42,086 A:middle
Back to you, Paresh.

211
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:47,686 A:middle
>> So next, let's take a deeper
dive at the tools, options,

212
00:10:47,686 --> 00:10:49,676 A:middle
controls, flexibility you have

213
00:10:50,146 --> 00:10:53,596 A:middle
in making advertising
work using iAd Workbench.

214
00:10:53,976 --> 00:11:02,526 A:middle
We'll look at the choices you
have in choosing your audience,

215

216
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

217
00:10:53,976 --> 00:11:02,526 A:middle
We'll look at the choices you
have in choosing your audience,

218
00:11:03,156 --> 00:11:08,326 A:middle
the controls you have in
setting your price, the tools

219
00:11:08,326 --> 00:11:11,446 A:middle
and options you have to create
an ad that will make an impact,

220
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:15,366 A:middle
and finally, the data
and insights you have

221
00:11:16,136 --> 00:11:18,936 A:middle
to understand your campaign
performance and optimize.

222
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,826 A:middle
Let's start with
choosing your audience.

223
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:26,596 A:middle
Selecting the right audience
for your app or product is key.

224
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:31,126 A:middle
With iAd Workbench, we
make it very easy for you

225
00:11:31,406 --> 00:11:32,516 A:middle
to define your audience.

226
00:11:33,846 --> 00:11:37,896 A:middle
At the highest level,
you have two options.

227
00:11:37,896 --> 00:11:39,686 A:middle
Auto and Manual.

228
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:44,766 A:middle
Auto targeting, which you saw
in the demo is the simplest

229
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:47,726 A:middle
and probably the most powerful
option we have on iAd Workbench.

230
00:11:48,816 --> 00:11:52,386 A:middle
This is where iAd does all
the heavy lifting for you.

231
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:56,656 A:middle
If you want control,
you can choose Manual.

232
00:11:58,016 --> 00:12:01,396 A:middle
When you choose Manual,
you'll have several options

233

234
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

235
00:11:58,016 --> 00:12:01,396 A:middle
When you choose Manual,
you'll have several options

236
00:12:02,716 --> 00:12:03,666 A:middle
to define your audience.

237
00:12:04,346 --> 00:12:07,516 A:middle
On the left side, you see
simple targeting options

238
00:12:08,246 --> 00:12:12,256 A:middle
like gender, age,
geo, and device.

239
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:16,566 A:middle
You can choose, for age, you
can choose specific age groups

240
00:12:16,706 --> 00:12:17,636 A:middle
that you want to target.

241
00:12:18,526 --> 00:12:23,206 A:middle
For geo, you can choose
or specify states and DMAs

242
00:12:23,336 --> 00:12:24,786 A:middle
that you want to
target for your users.

243
00:12:26,156 --> 00:12:29,366 A:middle
On the right side, there are
some very powerful options.

244
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:35,046 A:middle
Starting to the top, iTunes
Preferences is an option

245
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,486 A:middle
that is exclusive to iAd.

246
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:41,036 A:middle
This is where the
power of the App Store

247
00:12:41,196 --> 00:12:44,026 A:middle
and the iTunes Store
comes together

248
00:12:44,186 --> 00:12:45,686 A:middle
to help you find
the right audience.

249
00:12:47,176 --> 00:12:51,616 A:middle
When you make a selection here,
you're basically selecting users

250
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:57,066 A:middle
who have actually downloaded
content in that category.

251
00:12:57,066 --> 00:13:01,406 A:middle
So if you were to promote
a health and fitness app,

252

253
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

254
00:12:57,066 --> 00:13:01,406 A:middle
So if you were to promote
a health and fitness app,

255
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:05,716 A:middle
wouldn't it be great if you
could choose the audience

256
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:08,406 A:middle
who like to download
health and fitness apps,

257
00:13:09,526 --> 00:13:12,696 A:middle
or who like to download
fitness and workout music.

258
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,856 A:middle
With iAd Workbench,
you can do that.

259
00:13:16,886 --> 00:13:17,776 A:middle
It's very powerful.

260
00:13:19,116 --> 00:13:22,206 A:middle
The next three options
lets you define

261
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:24,766 A:middle
where your ad wants-where
you want to show your ad,

262
00:13:25,116 --> 00:13:26,206 A:middle
which is App Channels.

263
00:13:27,726 --> 00:13:30,336 A:middle
When you want to show
your ad, that's scheduling

264
00:13:31,146 --> 00:13:34,546 A:middle
and how often do you want to
show an ad to a particular user,

265
00:13:35,026 --> 00:13:36,076 A:middle
which is frequency capping.

266
00:13:37,476 --> 00:13:40,046 A:middle
You can mix and match
any of these options

267
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,816 A:middle
to define the right
audience for your campaign.

268
00:13:45,996 --> 00:13:48,586 A:middle
Next, let's look at the
flexibility you have

269
00:13:48,636 --> 00:13:49,606 A:middle
in setting your price.

270
00:13:50,306 --> 00:13:55,046 A:middle
With iAd Workbench, you
can choose how you want

271
00:13:55,046 --> 00:13:56,236 A:middle
to pay for your campaign.

272
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:00,606 A:middle
If you want to pay for every
click, you can choose CPC.

273

274
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

275
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:00,606 A:middle
If you want to pay for every
click, you can choose CPC.

276
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,806 A:middle
If you want to pay for
every thousand impressions,

277
00:14:04,486 --> 00:14:05,676 A:middle
you can choose CPM.

278
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:10,416 A:middle
The bid you enter is the
maximum you're willing to pay

279
00:14:10,936 --> 00:14:12,006 A:middle
when you win the auction.

280
00:14:13,306 --> 00:14:16,086 A:middle
iAd Workbench is a
bidded marketplace.

281
00:14:16,996 --> 00:14:20,286 A:middle
And on this platform, you
have the peace of mind to know

282
00:14:21,276 --> 00:14:27,106 A:middle
that you only pay a penny more
than the next highest bidder.

283
00:14:27,286 --> 00:14:30,616 A:middle
Now let's look at the options
you have in creating your ad.

284
00:14:31,446 --> 00:14:33,256 A:middle
There are a range
of options you have

285
00:14:33,636 --> 00:14:35,066 A:middle
when it comes to
selecting your ad.

286
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:40,876 A:middle
You can have Banner Ads, Video
Ads, which are also known

287
00:14:40,876 --> 00:14:45,246 A:middle
as pre-roll, and Rich-Media Ads
if you want higher engagement

288
00:14:45,246 --> 00:14:50,786 A:middle
of the users with your ads.

289
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:54,426 A:middle
Banner ads provide a
direct path to action.

290
00:14:55,336 --> 00:14:58,016 A:middle
Upon tap of a banner, you
can take a user directly

291
00:14:58,046 --> 00:15:01,016 A:middle
to an iTunes product page
or to a mobile website.

292

293
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

294
00:14:58,046 --> 00:15:01,016 A:middle
to an iTunes product page
or to a mobile website.

295
00:15:02,156 --> 00:15:04,816 A:middle
Upon tap of a banner,
you can also take a user

296
00:15:05,596 --> 00:15:10,146 A:middle
and show them a video and then
take them to iTunes product page

297
00:15:10,246 --> 00:15:11,386 A:middle
or to a mobile website.

298
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:16,706 A:middle
Let's take a look as an example
how a banner ad looks like.

299
00:15:17,676 --> 00:15:21,456 A:middle
Here's an app, you see the
ad will render at the bottom.

300
00:15:21,976 --> 00:15:25,416 A:middle
After a few seconds,
the ad will refresh,

301
00:15:27,336 --> 00:15:28,916 A:middle
the user engages with the ad.

302
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:33,316 A:middle
And when the user clicks on it,

303
00:15:33,776 --> 00:15:35,066 A:middle
the user is taken
to the App Store.

304
00:15:36,076 --> 00:15:38,266 A:middle
The user can download
the app at this point.

305
00:15:39,376 --> 00:15:42,036 A:middle
Now once the user
downloads the app,

306
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:46,916 A:middle
you don't show the same
download ad again to this user,

307
00:15:47,826 --> 00:15:52,646 A:middle
which means you don't waste your
money showing your ads to users

308
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,466 A:middle
who already have your app.

309
00:15:57,446 --> 00:15:58,696 A:middle
Next is Video ads.

310
00:15:59,836 --> 00:16:03,406 A:middle
Video ads play automatically
before a video content.

311

312
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

313
00:15:59,836 --> 00:16:03,406 A:middle
Video ads play automatically
before a video content.

314
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,866 A:middle
They play directly
in fullscreen mode.

315
00:16:06,446 --> 00:16:10,196 A:middle
With video ads, you can also
have an optional call to action

316
00:16:10,756 --> 00:16:11,836 A:middle
which will take the user

317
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:14,896 A:middle
to an iTunes product
page or a mobile website.

318
00:16:15,936 --> 00:16:17,606 A:middle
Here's an example of a video ad.

319
00:16:17,606 --> 00:16:19,196 A:middle
>> [Background Music]
You can chase light,

320
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:22,316 A:middle
or let the light chase you.

321
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:23,776 A:middle
Introducing LightRight,

322
00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:26,896 A:middle
an iOS bookmarking
tool for natural light.

323
00:16:26,896 --> 00:16:34,626 A:middle
LightRight for iPhone, now
available in the App Store.

324
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,376 A:middle
>> As you noticed, there
was a Learn More link

325
00:16:36,376 --> 00:16:37,496 A:middle
at the bottom of that video.

326
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:41,686 A:middle
The user clicks on that Learn
More link and the user is taken

327
00:16:41,686 --> 00:16:42,676 A:middle
to the iTunes product page.

328
00:16:42,676 --> 00:16:45,036 A:middle
You can also have the user
go to a mobile website.

329
00:16:45,736 --> 00:16:51,276 A:middle
If you want to create rich-media
ads for more higher engagement,

330
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:53,906 A:middle
you can do that using
iAd Workbench as well.

331
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:57,976 A:middle
Upon tap of a banner, you
can immerse your users

332
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:01,676 A:middle
into a very custom product
or brand experience.

333

334
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

335
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:01,676 A:middle
into a very custom product
or brand experience.

336
00:17:02,716 --> 00:17:06,046 A:middle
You can choose any combination
of features and any combination

337
00:17:06,046 --> 00:17:08,386 A:middle
of call to actions to
create a rich-media ad.

338
00:17:09,116 --> 00:17:10,356 A:middle
I'll show you an example

339
00:17:11,366 --> 00:17:14,586 A:middle
that the client had actually
used really good features

340
00:17:14,705 --> 00:17:16,376 A:middle
to create a great experience.

341
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:17,675 A:middle
Let's take a look.

342
00:17:17,675 --> 00:17:19,326 A:middle
Here's the app.

343
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:22,756 A:middle
You see the ad being rendered.

344
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:27,056 A:middle
The user taps on the ad,
and is taken-is immersed

345
00:17:27,056 --> 00:17:28,185 A:middle
into a brand experience.

346
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,056 A:middle
The user can browse through
the pictures gallery.

347
00:17:35,496 --> 00:17:39,776 A:middle
The user is still
within the app.

348
00:17:40,036 --> 00:17:41,566 A:middle
You can take the
user to Facebook

349
00:17:41,926 --> 00:17:43,486 A:middle
so you can have a
Facebook integration.

350
00:17:43,816 --> 00:17:46,206 A:middle
You can have the user like
your page on Facebook.

351
00:17:46,506 --> 00:17:52,906 A:middle
You can have the reservations
module within the ad.

352
00:17:53,146 --> 00:17:55,916 A:middle
And finally, you can even
integrate the app download right

353
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,176 A:middle
from this place.

354
00:17:58,276 --> 00:18:01,016 A:middle
So as you see, you
can do a lot of things

355

356
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

357
00:17:58,276 --> 00:18:01,016 A:middle
So as you see, you
can do a lot of things

358
00:18:01,016 --> 00:18:02,226 A:middle
when it comes to rich-media ads.

359
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:08,126 A:middle
Now that awesome ad was
created using a free tool

360
00:18:08,126 --> 00:18:12,606 A:middle
that is available to everyone
which is called iAd Producer.

361
00:18:12,606 --> 00:18:19,196 A:middle
With iAd Producer, you can
create highly interactive

362
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:19,846 A:middle
rich-media ads.

363
00:18:21,126 --> 00:18:24,266 A:middle
They made it so easy for
you that you can just drag

364
00:18:24,266 --> 00:18:26,916 A:middle
and drop your assets
in a visual layout.

365
00:18:27,536 --> 00:18:29,056 A:middle
Or you can customize
the visual layout.

366
00:18:29,496 --> 00:18:35,526 A:middle
We provide you with an extensive
library of over 500 blueprints

367
00:18:36,286 --> 00:18:37,156 A:middle
which are like templates.

368
00:18:37,846 --> 00:18:39,516 A:middle
And when you use one
of these blueprints,

369
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:42,466 A:middle
they come with built-in
performance and analytics

370
00:18:42,606 --> 00:18:46,166 A:middle
so you can see how your user
is engaging and interacting

371
00:18:46,456 --> 00:18:47,996 A:middle
with the rich-media ad.

372
00:18:48,816 --> 00:18:51,436 A:middle
And finally, with
iAd Producer 4.2

373
00:18:51,716 --> 00:18:53,786 A:middle
that was introduced
just two weeks ago,

374
00:18:53,826 --> 00:19:00,156 A:middle
you have integrated iAd Producer
with Workbench, which means,

375

376
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

377
00:18:53,826 --> 00:19:00,156 A:middle
you have integrated iAd Producer
with Workbench, which means,

378
00:19:00,776 --> 00:19:02,656 A:middle
if you create an ad
using iAd Producer,

379
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:06,466 A:middle
you can now upload it
directly on to Workbench.

380
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:12,516 A:middle
And when you go to Workbench,
you'll have it available to use.

381
00:19:14,856 --> 00:19:16,516 A:middle
So once you create
your campaign,

382
00:19:17,036 --> 00:19:20,326 A:middle
your campaign is
running and you want

383
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,906 A:middle
to see how the campaign
is performing.

384
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:26,126 A:middle
When it comes to
campaign performance,

385
00:19:26,236 --> 00:19:28,866 A:middle
we provide you rich analytics

386
00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:31,556 A:middle
that helps you understand
how your campaign is doing

387
00:19:31,556 --> 00:19:33,046 A:middle
so you can take the
right actions.

388
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:36,556 A:middle
We give you data,
performance metrics,

389
00:19:36,556 --> 00:19:38,946 A:middle
as well as conversion metrics
which includes, you know,

390
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:40,906 A:middle
what your spend is,
your capture rate is,

391
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:44,556 A:middle
number of impressions you
got, as well as the downloads

392
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:47,946 A:middle
that you've received so
you can tune your campaign.

393
00:19:49,326 --> 00:19:51,236 A:middle
We provide you this
data at every level

394
00:19:52,586 --> 00:19:55,366 A:middle
at the aggregate
campaign level as well

395
00:19:55,366 --> 00:19:59,966 A:middle
as at lower line and ad levels.

396

397
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

398
00:20:00,046 --> 00:20:03,936 A:middle
You can also download this
data as a .CSV file from any

399
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:04,876 A:middle
of the analytic screens.

400
00:20:05,396 --> 00:20:10,256 A:middle
So, at this point, I'll ask
Ravi to walk us through some

401
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:11,676 A:middle
of these tools and
options that we talked

402
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:13,766 A:middle
about to make your
advertising work.

403
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:15,796 A:middle
>> Thank you, Paresh.

404
00:20:15,796 --> 00:20:22,926 A:middle
In this demo, I'm going
to walk you through some

405
00:20:22,926 --> 00:20:24,926 A:middle
of the core concepts that
Paresh has mentioned,

406
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:29,596 A:middle
touch and targeting, some of
the new ad formats analytics.

407
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:31,886 A:middle
Let's get started.

408
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:35,936 A:middle
I've been working on a
campaign I'm halfway through it,

409
00:20:37,146 --> 00:20:39,056 A:middle
let's finish this
campaign together.

410
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:46,086 A:middle
I created a campaign and
created just one line

411
00:20:47,506 --> 00:20:50,376 A:middle
with a manual targeting
and I want

412
00:20:50,376 --> 00:20:52,116 A:middle
to finish-show you
what targeting I've set

413
00:20:52,116 --> 00:20:57,416 A:middle
up by editing the
line and later,

414
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,896 A:middle
we'll add ads to this one.

415

416
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

417
00:21:00,446 --> 00:21:10,146 A:middle
A targeting option, we're going
to select as Manual and this-and

418
00:21:10,146 --> 00:21:12,576 A:middle
for the country, let's
leave it as United States.

419
00:21:12,696 --> 00:21:17,026 A:middle
And these are the
different targeting options

420
00:21:17,246 --> 00:21:18,186 A:middle
that we have available.

421
00:21:20,636 --> 00:21:23,256 A:middle
You can see all the options
on the left-hand side.

422
00:21:23,956 --> 00:21:26,566 A:middle
On the right, you will see the
options that we have selected.

423
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:28,176 A:middle
By default, it's All.

424
00:21:30,516 --> 00:21:35,936 A:middle
Next, I'm going to target
few of the app references.

425
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:43,886 A:middle
I'm going to select Lifestyle,
Photo and Video and Travel.

426
00:21:46,246 --> 00:21:48,896 A:middle
Then for App Channels, I
want to do similar thing.

427
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:51,946 A:middle
I'm going to do Lifestyle,

428
00:21:52,126 --> 00:21:56,946 A:middle
I'm going to do Photo
and Video and Travel.

429
00:21:58,746 --> 00:22:02,076 A:middle
You can always select
more based upon,

430

431
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

432
00:21:58,746 --> 00:22:02,076 A:middle
You can always select
more based upon,

433
00:22:02,076 --> 00:22:03,066 A:middle
you know, how it's performing.

434
00:22:04,426 --> 00:22:08,486 A:middle
For app type, last time we
did for creative: banner.

435
00:22:09,906 --> 00:22:12,026 A:middle
This time we're going to
do video as a creative

436
00:22:13,356 --> 00:22:14,716 A:middle
to a website as a destination.

437
00:22:15,746 --> 00:22:17,666 A:middle
My goal here is to drive
traffic to the website.

438
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:23,706 A:middle
And for flight dates,
let's leave it as a default

439
00:22:23,706 --> 00:22:27,226 A:middle
and I've given some
spend, budget and bid here.

440
00:22:27,226 --> 00:22:35,076 A:middle
Let's go to the next step
where we can create an ad.

441
00:22:36,936 --> 00:22:39,726 A:middle
Here we have two choices,
a banner or a video.

442
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:41,776 A:middle
Let's select video.

443
00:22:41,776 --> 00:22:48,486 A:middle
And where your ad-you want
your ad to run for devices

444
00:22:48,486 --> 00:22:50,746 A:middle
for maximum reach,
let's pick Universal.

445
00:22:52,006 --> 00:22:54,926 A:middle
For language, let's
keep it at English.

446
00:22:56,236 --> 00:22:59,556 A:middle
And here we are at a step where
we need to upload a video file.

447
00:22:59,556 --> 00:23:05,436 A:middle
iAd Workbench supports
two formats

448

449
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

450
00:22:59,556 --> 00:23:05,436 A:middle
iAd Workbench supports
two formats

451
00:23:05,436 --> 00:23:09,216 A:middle
for the video file,
.M4V and .MOV.

452
00:23:09,406 --> 00:23:11,156 A:middle
There are few more
specs here right here.

453
00:23:12,616 --> 00:23:14,586 A:middle
We encourage you to follow
the specs so you don't trip

454
00:23:14,586 --> 00:23:15,666 A:middle
on any validation errors.

455
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,656 A:middle
Let's upload.

456
00:23:22,856 --> 00:23:24,936 A:middle
The file is being
uploaded from my laptop

457
00:23:25,266 --> 00:23:28,556 A:middle
to the Workbench
servers right now.

458
00:23:28,626 --> 00:23:30,156 A:middle
Once the file reaches
the servers,

459
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:34,006 A:middle
the file will be transcoded
to multiple formats

460
00:23:35,336 --> 00:23:37,336 A:middle
to suit the devices
and resolutions

461
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:41,836 A:middle
like iPhone high res, low res,
iPad high res and low res.

462
00:23:43,626 --> 00:23:44,656 A:middle
It's uploading right now.

463
00:23:48,906 --> 00:23:50,386 A:middle
Let it take its time.

464
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,556 A:middle
I guess everybody is using
the network bandwidth I guess.

465
00:23:57,026 --> 00:23:58,876 A:middle
So, right now it seems like
the file has reached the server

466
00:23:58,876 --> 00:24:00,926 A:middle
as you saw the status
changed to Formatting.

467

468
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

469
00:23:58,876 --> 00:24:00,926 A:middle
as you saw the status
changed to Formatting.

470
00:24:02,686 --> 00:24:04,886 A:middle
This is when the video
transcoding is happening.

471
00:24:06,306 --> 00:24:09,026 A:middle
It's actually transforming the
video to suit the other devices.

472
00:24:09,126 --> 00:24:12,536 A:middle
Let's take a quick review.

473
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,776 A:middle
>> [Background Music]
You can chase light

474
00:24:19,776 --> 00:24:22,906 A:middle
or let the light chase you.

475
00:24:22,906 --> 00:24:24,356 A:middle
Introducing LightRight,

476
00:24:24,356 --> 00:24:27,676 A:middle
an iOS bookmarking
tool for natural light.

477
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:37,796 A:middle
LightRight for iPhone, now
available from the App Store.

478
00:24:37,796 --> 00:24:38,536 A:middle
>> That was a cool video.

479
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:42,056 A:middle
I just want to highlight
one thing here.

480
00:24:42,996 --> 00:24:48,446 A:middle
For you as an advertiser,
prepare one file

481
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:52,056 A:middle
to one technical
specification and be assured

482
00:24:52,056 --> 00:24:57,746 A:middle
that your ad-video ad is going
to run on all the Apple devices

483
00:24:58,276 --> 00:25:06,136 A:middle
in the best way possible,
so, that's how simple it is

484

485
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

486
00:24:58,276 --> 00:25:06,136 A:middle
in the best way possible,
so, that's how simple it is

487
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:10,806 A:middle
to create a video ad here.

488
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:15,466 A:middle
Use this ad format, we encourage
you to take advantage of it.

489
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:16,776 A:middle
Let's select the destination.

490
00:25:17,206 --> 00:25:19,916 A:middle
As I said I'm going
to the website.

491
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:23,076 A:middle
You can view the URL right here.

492
00:25:29,466 --> 00:25:33,356 A:middle
And then it will ask you for
the destination, for the name.

493
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:35,706 A:middle
I like the name LightRight
website here.

494
00:25:35,706 --> 00:25:38,276 A:middle
So I'm going to leave it as is.

495
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:40,776 A:middle
For this app to go live, you
need to assign to the line.

496
00:25:41,176 --> 00:25:43,316 A:middle
I'm going to assign to the video
line that I created earlier.

497
00:25:46,976 --> 00:25:47,986 A:middle
Let's name the ad.

498
00:25:49,086 --> 00:25:51,476 A:middle
I'm going to name it
as My Awesome Video.

499
00:25:57,886 --> 00:26:00,446 A:middle
Clicking on Next will take
us to the Ad Summary page.

500

501
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

502
00:25:57,886 --> 00:26:00,446 A:middle
Clicking on Next will take
us to the Ad Summary page.

503
00:26:02,446 --> 00:26:07,456 A:middle
So, that's the demo of the
powerful ad format video ad.

504
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:14,676 A:middle
So far in my two
demos, we mainly focused

505
00:26:14,676 --> 00:26:17,276 A:middle
on creating a campaign,
on editing a campaign,

506
00:26:17,866 --> 00:26:19,926 A:middle
focused on a little bit on
targeting and ad formats.

507
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:24,146 A:middle
Once a campaign is
created, the next thing

508
00:26:24,146 --> 00:26:27,686 A:middle
to focus is monitoring the
performance of the campaign

509
00:26:28,566 --> 00:26:33,136 A:middle
to ensure that it is going
towards the goal you have set

510
00:26:33,136 --> 00:26:33,526 A:middle
out for.

511
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,306 A:middle
In order to monitor the
performance of the campaign,

512
00:26:40,286 --> 00:26:41,206 A:middle
we have some analytics.

513
00:26:42,576 --> 00:26:44,846 A:middle
So, next, I want you to
take-I want to take you

514
00:26:44,846 --> 00:26:45,846 A:middle
to the analytics pages.

515
00:26:48,836 --> 00:26:51,626 A:middle
I have these two campaigns
that have been running

516
00:26:51,626 --> 00:26:54,066 A:middle
for the last 6 months.

517
00:26:54,066 --> 00:26:56,886 A:middle
I want to show the
performance of these campaigns.

518
00:26:57,086 --> 00:27:01,406 A:middle
As you see the Dashboard
used the basic metrics spend,

519

520
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

521
00:26:57,086 --> 00:27:01,406 A:middle
As you see the Dashboard
used the basic metrics spend,

522
00:27:01,846 --> 00:27:04,486 A:middle
impressions, TTR
and conversions.

523
00:27:04,986 --> 00:27:09,386 A:middle
You can click on any of these
metrics and go into the details.

524
00:27:12,396 --> 00:27:14,556 A:middle
By default, it gives
Since Campaign Start

525
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:20,426 A:middle
and you have different custom
data groups you can select

526
00:27:20,426 --> 00:27:21,356 A:middle
that we have prepared for you.

527
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:23,146 A:middle
Let me select last 30 days.

528
00:27:26,616 --> 00:27:29,076 A:middle
That's the spend for the last
30 days for this campaign.

529
00:27:30,506 --> 00:27:32,456 A:middle
Seems like we are spending
more in the weekends

530
00:27:32,626 --> 00:27:34,786 A:middle
and spend is coming down
during the weekdays.

531
00:27:35,386 --> 00:27:38,986 A:middle
You have different
metrics that you can view.

532
00:27:39,446 --> 00:27:40,166 A:middle
I've listed here.

533
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:48,276 A:middle
And you can overlay any
metric on top of it.

534
00:27:48,496 --> 00:27:50,746 A:middle
Or if you want to compare
how you've been spending,

535
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,056 A:middle
compare to the previous period,

536
00:27:53,586 --> 00:27:56,316 A:middle
you can always select
Compare with Previous Period.

537
00:27:57,256 --> 00:28:01,496 A:middle
That gives you how the last 30
days is performing as opposed

538

539
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

540
00:27:57,256 --> 00:28:01,496 A:middle
That gives you how the last 30
days is performing as opposed

541
00:28:01,496 --> 00:28:06,296 A:middle
to the previous 30 days.

542
00:28:06,326 --> 00:28:08,246 A:middle
Overlay is a pretty neat feature

543
00:28:08,246 --> 00:28:17,166 A:middle
where you can overlay any metric
here and compare to the spend.

544
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:18,596 A:middle
I ordered average CPA metric.

545
00:28:19,316 --> 00:28:22,226 A:middle
It seems like we are doing less

546
00:28:22,226 --> 00:28:23,646 A:middle
than 2 dollars for
download here.

547
00:28:27,336 --> 00:28:28,286 A:middle
Let's go into the lines.

548
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:32,906 A:middle
By default, it gives you
the cumulative number.

549
00:28:34,116 --> 00:28:36,936 A:middle
You can always select
Time, Time Series graph

550
00:28:37,186 --> 00:28:38,376 A:middle
to see how the lines
are performing.

551
00:28:38,936 --> 00:28:42,116 A:middle
It seems like we are spending
more on this line than this one.

552
00:28:42,316 --> 00:28:50,026 A:middle
And you can do similar
analysis on ad side as well.

553
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:53,066 A:middle
By default, it gives you
the spend for cumulative.

554
00:28:53,156 --> 00:28:56,466 A:middle
You can always change
the metrics and change

555
00:28:56,466 --> 00:28:57,566 A:middle
to the time series graph.

556
00:28:58,866 --> 00:29:00,626 A:middle
We're pretty close on
these two ads here.

557

558
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

559
00:28:58,866 --> 00:29:00,626 A:middle
We're pretty close on
these two ads here.

560
00:29:00,626 --> 00:29:04,786 A:middle
Let me go back to
the summary and find

561
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:05,686 A:middle
out a couple of things here.

562
00:29:06,356 --> 00:29:08,886 A:middle
You can easily toggle between
a graph and a table view

563
00:29:09,296 --> 00:29:10,156 A:middle
if you choose to do so.

564
00:29:12,906 --> 00:29:16,536 A:middle
Or if you can scroll down and
you can click on Download CSV

565
00:29:16,536 --> 00:29:22,136 A:middle
to get a file onto your
desktop and do offline analysis.

566
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,676 A:middle
And Download CSV is available
across the board on Dashboard

567
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:28,946 A:middle
on every analytic
space that we have.

568
00:29:32,636 --> 00:29:35,176 A:middle
So, that's a quick
overview of, you know,

569
00:29:35,176 --> 00:29:37,576 A:middle
how to measure the
performance of your campaign.

570
00:29:39,276 --> 00:29:42,056 A:middle
All the data that I've been
showing in last 5 minutes,

571
00:29:42,596 --> 00:29:44,376 A:middle
that data is available
through the API.

572
00:29:45,896 --> 00:29:48,346 A:middle
So, next, I'm going to drop you
through the complete overview

573
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:51,216 A:middle
of iAd Workbench API that
we have released this year.

574
00:29:52,366 --> 00:29:54,966 A:middle
So, your-you are an advertiser.

575
00:29:55,406 --> 00:29:57,586 A:middle
You have created
multiple campaigns

576
00:29:58,286 --> 00:30:00,336 A:middle
and managing all
those campaigns.

577

578
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

579
00:29:58,286 --> 00:30:00,336 A:middle
and managing all
those campaigns.

580
00:30:01,336 --> 00:30:03,756 A:middle
And you want to scale
beyond the web interface.

581
00:30:05,556 --> 00:30:06,696 A:middle
API is for you.

582
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,076 A:middle
Say you're an advertiser who
wanted to get the metrics

583
00:30:11,256 --> 00:30:14,216 A:middle
and incorporate it to
your own dashboards.

584
00:30:15,516 --> 00:30:16,356 A:middle
API is for you.

585
00:30:17,766 --> 00:30:19,586 A:middle
Let's get into the-more details.

586
00:30:20,846 --> 00:30:22,456 A:middle
You can also use it
for bulk operations.

587
00:30:26,316 --> 00:30:29,176 A:middle
API has two broad categories.

588
00:30:31,486 --> 00:30:37,576 A:middle
Reporting, where you can get the
metrics and perform the offline

589
00:30:37,576 --> 00:30:38,636 A:middle
and real-time analysis.

590
00:30:39,056 --> 00:30:42,966 A:middle
What do I mean by
real-time analysis here?

591
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:45,406 A:middle
You can write a program for
example that runs at the top

592
00:30:45,406 --> 00:30:50,446 A:middle
of every hour, get some
metrics, analyze the data

593
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:53,296 A:middle
and modify your campaign data.

594
00:30:53,296 --> 00:30:57,426 A:middle
You can trace the bid, start
and stop a campaign ad.

595
00:30:58,726 --> 00:31:00,456 A:middle
That's what I'm talking
about real-time analysis.

596

597
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

598
00:30:58,726 --> 00:31:00,456 A:middle
That's what I'm talking
about real-time analysis.

599
00:31:00,886 --> 00:31:04,296 A:middle
For offline analysis, you
can do your own dashboards.

600
00:31:04,456 --> 00:31:11,196 A:middle
And campaign management, you
can get the campaign details,

601
00:31:11,526 --> 00:31:13,956 A:middle
update the critical
campaign data and start

602
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:15,926 A:middle
and stop campaign lines or ads.

603
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:20,996 A:middle
Let's get into some very basics.

604
00:31:20,996 --> 00:31:22,256 A:middle
We're talking about API here.

605
00:31:23,946 --> 00:31:29,876 A:middle
For communication, API
uses JSON or HTTPS.

606
00:31:29,876 --> 00:31:33,326 A:middle
We want to keep the data
protocol pretty simple

607
00:31:33,326 --> 00:31:35,896 A:middle
so it's easy to understand
and it's easy to test.

608
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:41,266 A:middle
We use JSON for data protocol
and secure HTTPS for security.

609
00:31:41,856 --> 00:31:50,306 A:middle
The next: authentication, we use
client certificates, private key

610
00:31:50,306 --> 00:31:55,106 A:middle
and access token as a
combination for authentication,

611
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:56,776 A:middle
making it a very
strong authentication.

612
00:31:57,286 --> 00:32:02,616 A:middle
And for key management, we want
to make it as easy as possible

613

614
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

615
00:31:57,286 --> 00:32:02,616 A:middle
And for key management, we want
to make it as easy as possible

616
00:32:03,616 --> 00:32:05,896 A:middle
so you can be having
web interface

617
00:32:05,896 --> 00:32:08,086 A:middle
for that on Workbench app.

618
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:13,466 A:middle
So, how do you initiate
this API?

619
00:32:13,466 --> 00:32:17,826 A:middle
We have three basic
steps: download keys,

620
00:32:18,096 --> 00:32:19,676 A:middle
verify keys and integrate.

621
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:25,886 A:middle
Go to Workbench,
go to the API page,

622
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,126 A:middle
click on the Download
link to download the keys.

623
00:32:30,306 --> 00:32:32,696 A:middle
When you download the keys,
we give you a .zip file

624
00:32:32,696 --> 00:32:34,446 A:middle
that has keys and
sample programs.

625
00:32:34,576 --> 00:32:39,826 A:middle
And sample programs are
already embedded with your keys.

626
00:32:40,026 --> 00:32:42,616 A:middle
Run those sample programs
and verify the keys.

627
00:32:43,106 --> 00:32:47,686 A:middle
And then download the
API programming guide,

628
00:32:49,966 --> 00:32:53,096 A:middle
write your own programs,
deploy them on your servers

629
00:32:53,146 --> 00:32:56,196 A:middle
and integrate, that's
how simple it is.

630
00:32:57,946 --> 00:33:00,296 A:middle
Let me quickly walk you through
some of the core methods here.

631

632
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

633
00:32:57,946 --> 00:33:00,296 A:middle
Let me quickly walk you through
some of the core methods here.

634
00:33:00,776 --> 00:33:05,996 A:middle
We have InitSession for session
initialization, which is key

635
00:33:06,436 --> 00:33:08,506 A:middle
because you need to pass the
sessionId for every method

636
00:33:08,506 --> 00:33:11,476 A:middle
that you are going to call
in your program for API.

637
00:33:12,766 --> 00:33:18,106 A:middle
Campaign method-metadata methods
to get the campaign details,

638
00:33:18,216 --> 00:33:20,226 A:middle
reporting API to
get the metrics.

639
00:33:20,226 --> 00:33:26,626 A:middle
And campaign management
API to update the details

640
00:33:26,626 --> 00:33:32,446 A:middle
as well as start and stop.

641
00:33:32,566 --> 00:33:33,856 A:middle
Now, I'm going to
walk you through some

642
00:33:33,856 --> 00:33:36,926 A:middle
of the sample program that
I've already done using the

643
00:33:36,926 --> 00:33:39,136 A:middle
highlighted methods
here, InitSession,

644
00:33:39,626 --> 00:33:45,746 A:middle
GetCampaignDetails
and UpdateLine.

645
00:33:45,746 --> 00:33:49,836 A:middle
So, here is a sample program,
sample method where I'm trying

646
00:33:49,836 --> 00:33:53,666 A:middle
to pass access token,
prepare the request tab,

647
00:33:55,596 --> 00:34:00,386 A:middle
post it to the server
then get the response back

648

649
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

650
00:33:55,596 --> 00:34:00,386 A:middle
post it to the server
then get the response back

651
00:34:00,386 --> 00:34:03,646 A:middle
and read the session from that,
sessionId from the response.

652
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:08,786 A:middle
Once I get the sessionId,
I pass the sessionId

653
00:34:09,516 --> 00:34:14,826 A:middle
to getCampaignDetails method,
get the campaign IDs and filter

654
00:34:14,826 --> 00:34:18,246 A:middle
by running state, post
that to the server,

655
00:34:18,246 --> 00:34:20,646 A:middle
get the response back.

656
00:34:22,386 --> 00:34:27,686 A:middle
Next, for the campaign details
I got, I'm passing the LineId

657
00:34:27,686 --> 00:34:29,005 A:middle
for which I want to
increase the bid.

658
00:34:29,936 --> 00:34:33,426 A:middle
So I gave the line-SessionId,
LineId and the CPMBid,

659
00:34:37,016 --> 00:34:40,096 A:middle
post to server, and
get the response back.

660
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:44,275 A:middle
That's how simple it is
to write the programs

661
00:34:44,275 --> 00:34:49,206 A:middle
to communicate with the API.

662
00:34:49,426 --> 00:34:55,545 A:middle
Powerful, secure and easy
to use, go try it out.

663
00:34:56,146 --> 00:35:00,746 A:middle
With this, I'm going to
pass on to Paresh to walk us

664

665
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

666
00:34:56,146 --> 00:35:00,746 A:middle
With this, I'm going to
pass on to Paresh to walk us

667
00:35:00,746 --> 00:35:02,026 A:middle
through what's coming next.

668
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:03,486 A:middle
There you go Paresh.

669
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:05,496 A:middle
>> Thank you, Ravi.

670
00:35:05,786 --> 00:35:08,286 A:middle
It's fascinating what
you can do with the APIs

671
00:35:08,626 --> 00:35:10,816 A:middle
and how you can make bulk
changes to your campaigns

672
00:35:10,996 --> 00:35:12,176 A:middle
from your own user interface.

673
00:35:12,816 --> 00:35:17,506 A:middle
So, what's coming this fall?

674
00:35:17,706 --> 00:35:21,146 A:middle
So far, we've talked about
how iAd Workbench can help you

675
00:35:21,146 --> 00:35:22,706 A:middle
acquire new customers.

676
00:35:24,026 --> 00:35:25,556 A:middle
But that's just half the battle.

677
00:35:26,356 --> 00:35:30,566 A:middle
For you to grow your business,
you also need to re-engage

678
00:35:30,566 --> 00:35:34,586 A:middle
with your existing customers
and have them do more

679
00:35:34,586 --> 00:35:39,566 A:middle
of what you want, whether it's
spending more time in your app,

680
00:35:39,856 --> 00:35:42,966 A:middle
buying more of your products,
or even trying your new apps.

681
00:35:43,616 --> 00:35:47,116 A:middle
I came across a study
recently on the web

682
00:35:48,086 --> 00:35:49,866 A:middle
by a mobile analytics
firm, Localytics,

683
00:35:50,836 --> 00:35:53,196 A:middle
which said 22 percent
of the apps

684
00:35:53,196 --> 00:35:58,286 A:middle
that were downloaded were used
only once and over 60 percent

685
00:35:58,286 --> 00:36:01,416 A:middle
of them were used
less than 10 times.

686

687
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

688
00:35:58,286 --> 00:36:01,416 A:middle
of them were used
less than 10 times.

689
00:36:02,916 --> 00:36:05,516 A:middle
Now, you want users
to frequently engage

690
00:36:05,516 --> 00:36:07,346 A:middle
with your app or your website.

691
00:36:07,796 --> 00:36:11,766 A:middle
Let's take a few examples
how engaged-re-engaging

692
00:36:11,766 --> 00:36:14,076 A:middle
with your customers can
help you grow your business.

693
00:36:16,846 --> 00:36:19,816 A:middle
First example is
about a game app.

694
00:36:20,706 --> 00:36:26,536 A:middle
So you came up with a new iPad
version of your iPhone game.

695
00:36:26,736 --> 00:36:32,326 A:middle
Now, who will be the best
customers for this new app?

696
00:36:33,496 --> 00:36:37,156 A:middle
Of course, the users who
use that game on the iPhone.

697
00:36:37,156 --> 00:36:44,296 A:middle
What if you had a way to
connect with these customers

698
00:36:45,326 --> 00:36:48,056 A:middle
and inform them about
your new game?

699
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:52,126 A:middle
And what if you could inform
them about this new game

700
00:36:52,766 --> 00:36:56,966 A:middle
when they are on their iPad?

701
00:36:57,106 --> 00:36:59,296 A:middle
Or, say you enhanced your app

702
00:36:59,296 --> 00:37:01,466 A:middle
and you added more
levels more game levels

703

704
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

705
00:36:59,296 --> 00:37:01,466 A:middle
and you added more
levels more game levels

706
00:37:01,546 --> 00:37:05,886 A:middle
or you have more things that
you want to sell in your app.

707
00:37:06,156 --> 00:37:10,636 A:middle
What if you had a way to
re-engage with the users

708
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:17,196 A:middle
and show or promote these
levels only to users

709
00:37:17,196 --> 00:37:20,416 A:middle
who have reached certain
levels in your game

710
00:37:20,596 --> 00:37:23,436 A:middle
or show this merchandise
only to users

711
00:37:23,436 --> 00:37:28,086 A:middle
who actually buy
merchandise like this?

712
00:37:28,136 --> 00:37:32,796 A:middle
And what about all those
users who downloaded your app

713
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:37,386 A:middle
but haven't used it
in the last two weeks?

714
00:37:37,516 --> 00:37:40,496 A:middle
What if you had a way
to reconnect with them

715
00:37:41,356 --> 00:37:45,496 A:middle
and motivate them to try-come
back and try your app again?

716
00:37:46,496 --> 00:37:47,936 A:middle
And what if you could
connect with them

717
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,046 A:middle
when they're not in your app?

718
00:37:49,616 --> 00:37:51,756 A:middle
Let's take another example.

719
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:55,446 A:middle
A retail app.

720
00:37:55,446 --> 00:37:57,026 A:middle
Say you have a retail app.

721
00:37:57,336 --> 00:38:00,576 A:middle
Now, you have users who browse
through your product catalog

722

723
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

724
00:37:57,336 --> 00:38:00,576 A:middle
Now, you have users who browse
through your product catalog

725
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:03,206 A:middle
and add things to
the shopping basket.

726
00:38:04,106 --> 00:38:08,896 A:middle
Many of these users exit the
app before they actually make

727
00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:10,706 A:middle
a purchase.

728
00:38:10,836 --> 00:38:16,416 A:middle
What if you had a way to find
these users and bring them back

729
00:38:16,696 --> 00:38:19,126 A:middle
to finish the purchase and what

730
00:38:19,126 --> 00:38:22,266 A:middle
if you could bring them
back exactly at the point

731
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:24,326 A:middle
where they had left
in the shopping basket

732
00:38:25,296 --> 00:38:27,766 A:middle
so they can finish the
transaction in next step.

733
00:38:28,116 --> 00:38:33,776 A:middle
And if you want to send offers
to your loyal customers,

734
00:38:34,976 --> 00:38:36,416 A:middle
what if you could
show these offers

735
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:38,496 A:middle
to your loyal customers
irrespective

736
00:38:38,496 --> 00:38:40,616 A:middle
of what iOS device they are on?

737
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:47,066 A:middle
And for users and your
customers who have items

738
00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:50,326 A:middle
in their wish list, what if
you could reconnect with these

739
00:38:51,436 --> 00:38:54,436 A:middle
and inform them when the items
on the wish list are on sale?

740
00:38:54,436 --> 00:38:59,626 A:middle
Now, in each of these
examples that we talked about,

741
00:38:59,826 --> 00:39:02,086 A:middle
we talked about reconnecting

742

743
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

744
00:38:59,826 --> 00:39:02,086 A:middle
we talked about reconnecting

745
00:39:02,086 --> 00:39:03,856 A:middle
with a specific group
of audience.

746
00:39:05,396 --> 00:39:08,486 A:middle
Whether it's all the customers
who have downloaded your app

747
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:12,896 A:middle
or the dormant users who
haven't used your app,

748
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:17,936 A:middle
or the loyal users who do
purchases for you, or the users

749
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:22,186 A:middle
who have an abandoned cart
on your shopping-on your app.

750
00:39:22,406 --> 00:39:28,696 A:middle
We call this group of
audiences as "segments".

751
00:39:29,426 --> 00:39:32,976 A:middle
Now there are probably
a million ways you could

752
00:39:32,976 --> 00:39:34,116 A:middle
segment audiences.

753
00:39:35,266 --> 00:39:38,246 A:middle
You know your business and
your app, and your users best.

754
00:39:38,946 --> 00:39:42,156 A:middle
So you will segment your
users the way you want it.

755
00:39:42,866 --> 00:39:45,326 A:middle
And for you to easily
create segments,

756
00:39:47,156 --> 00:39:49,876 A:middle
we're introducing a new
functionality this fall

757
00:39:50,146 --> 00:39:54,346 A:middle
with iOS 8 which we call
Audience Segmentation.

758
00:39:55,736 --> 00:39:59,026 A:middle
Building segments using Audience
Segmentation is very easy.

759
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:01,386 A:middle
You can do it in just two steps.

760

761
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

762
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:01,386 A:middle
You can do it in just two steps.

763
00:40:03,436 --> 00:40:08,686 A:middle
The first one is you get
segment IDs from iAd Workbench.

764
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:14,496 A:middle
Now, every segment is unique
so it has a unique segment ID.

765
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:17,846 A:middle
You can download the segment
IDs from iAd Workbench.

766
00:40:18,906 --> 00:40:20,286 A:middle
Once you get the segment IDs,

767
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:24,546 A:middle
you then integrate those
segment IDs in your app.

768
00:40:26,496 --> 00:40:29,886 A:middle
You map the user behavior of
the functionality you have

769
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:32,466 A:middle
in the app with these
segment IDs.

770
00:40:33,816 --> 00:40:36,596 A:middle
And when the user demonstrates
a particular user behavior

771
00:40:37,076 --> 00:40:40,226 A:middle
or reaches a functionality,
say reaches a particular level,

772
00:40:41,026 --> 00:40:42,776 A:middle
you instrument it in a way

773
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:48,136 A:middle
that you automatically make API
call using the new iOS 8 SDK,

774
00:40:48,136 --> 00:40:52,636 A:middle
and pass that segment
ID onto Workbench.

775
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:55,736 A:middle
Now when you do that,

776
00:40:56,446 --> 00:40:59,366 A:middle
your segments will automatically
start getting populated

777
00:40:59,476 --> 00:41:00,296 A:middle
on iAd Workbench.

778

779
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

780
00:40:59,476 --> 00:41:00,296 A:middle
on iAd Workbench.

781
00:41:00,756 --> 00:41:03,986 A:middle
Here's an example where
segmentation was done based

782
00:41:03,986 --> 00:41:05,976 A:middle
on time spent in an app.

783
00:41:07,116 --> 00:41:10,616 A:middle
To avail your segments, users
who have spent less than 1 hour

784
00:41:10,616 --> 00:41:17,486 A:middle
in the app, 1 to 10 hours, 10 to
20 and 20 plus hours in the app.

785
00:41:17,746 --> 00:41:21,106 A:middle
Now, if you were to reconnect
or re-engage with these users,

786
00:41:21,976 --> 00:41:25,066 A:middle
you would probably have a very
different strategy when it comes

787
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:28,506 A:middle
to reengaging you with users
who have spent less than an hour

788
00:41:28,506 --> 00:41:32,306 A:middle
in your app compared to who
have spent more than 20 hours.

789
00:41:34,476 --> 00:41:36,256 A:middle
Here's another example

790
00:41:36,406 --> 00:41:39,296 A:middle
where segmentation is
based on levels of use.

791
00:41:41,996 --> 00:41:44,536 A:middle
Whenever a user reaches
a particular level,

792
00:41:45,646 --> 00:41:47,276 A:middle
they go from level 1 to level 2.

793
00:41:47,946 --> 00:41:50,826 A:middle
The API call that I talked
about is automatically made

794
00:41:50,826 --> 00:41:52,466 A:middle
from the client side
from your app

795
00:41:53,316 --> 00:41:54,866 A:middle
and the right segment
ID is passed

796
00:41:55,406 --> 00:41:57,736 A:middle
and the user gets added
to this new segment.

797
00:41:58,636 --> 00:42:01,616 A:middle
So once you do segmentation
this way using iOS 8,

798

799
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

800
00:41:58,636 --> 00:42:01,616 A:middle
So once you do segmentation
this way using iOS 8,

801
00:42:02,956 --> 00:42:07,456 A:middle
we can unlock some amazing
things which brings us

802
00:42:07,456 --> 00:42:09,376 A:middle
to the second thing that
we're introducing this fall,

803
00:42:10,326 --> 00:42:12,096 A:middle
we call it Audience Insights.

804
00:42:14,296 --> 00:42:17,776 A:middle
When your segments reach a
particular threshold of users,

805
00:42:19,176 --> 00:42:22,576 A:middle
we will show you unique audience
insights into your segments,

806
00:42:23,826 --> 00:42:26,826 A:middle
all for free at no charge.

807
00:42:27,356 --> 00:42:29,306 A:middle
These insights are
based on iTunes data.

808
00:42:30,726 --> 00:42:33,556 A:middle
So we'll show you how the
distribution is of the users

809
00:42:33,556 --> 00:42:35,976 A:middle
in your segment, the
demographic distribution.

810
00:42:36,936 --> 00:42:40,236 A:middle
How age, gender, household
income distribution is

811
00:42:40,346 --> 00:42:41,076 A:middle
for these users.

812
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:46,666 A:middle
We'll show you the top regions,
the top countries, top states,

813
00:42:46,896 --> 00:42:51,556 A:middle
DMAs these users come from, the
top languages these users have

814
00:42:51,556 --> 00:42:53,976 A:middle
on their devices as well

815
00:42:53,976 --> 00:42:56,176 A:middle
as the top iTunes
preferences of these users.

816
00:42:56,176 --> 00:42:58,906 A:middle
So you know what are the things
they really like to download.

817
00:42:59,316 --> 00:43:02,086 A:middle
Now once you have
these unique insights,

818

819
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

820
00:42:59,316 --> 00:43:02,086 A:middle
Now once you have
these unique insights,

821
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:05,566 A:middle
you can take some
very tangible actions.

822
00:43:06,256 --> 00:43:12,026 A:middle
If you know the demographics of
your audience in the segment,

823
00:43:13,066 --> 00:43:17,416 A:middle
you can fine tune your app to
suit more of the demographics.

824
00:43:18,806 --> 00:43:23,556 A:middle
If you know the top regions and
the languages of your audience,

825
00:43:24,526 --> 00:43:27,136 A:middle
you might want to consider
localizing your app.

826
00:43:27,976 --> 00:43:30,736 A:middle
If you have an English
app and you know

827
00:43:30,736 --> 00:43:33,176 A:middle
that the top region
is Asia Pacific

828
00:43:33,176 --> 00:43:37,626 A:middle
and the top language is
Japanese, you might want

829
00:43:37,626 --> 00:43:39,126 A:middle
to make a Japanese app.

830
00:43:39,186 --> 00:43:42,126 A:middle
If you created a segment
of all your loyal users,

831
00:43:42,816 --> 00:43:45,756 A:middle
now you understand
the characteristics

832
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:46,606 A:middle
of those audience.

833
00:43:47,946 --> 00:43:51,676 A:middle
And then using Workbench
targeting, you can find more

834
00:43:51,676 --> 00:43:55,096 A:middle
of the same and you can
build your audience pool.

835
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:58,176 A:middle
And finally, with
audience segmentation

836
00:43:58,926 --> 00:44:00,596 A:middle
and audience targeting together,

837

838
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

839
00:43:58,926 --> 00:44:00,596 A:middle
and audience targeting together,

840
00:44:01,786 --> 00:44:03,966 A:middle
we can bring you
another big thing

841
00:44:04,656 --> 00:44:06,266 A:middle
which we are also
introducing this fall

842
00:44:06,806 --> 00:44:09,476 A:middle
and we call it Audience
Retargeting.

843
00:44:09,826 --> 00:44:15,786 A:middle
Audience retargeting lets you
re-engage with every segment

844
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:17,916 A:middle
that you have in
a customized way

845
00:44:18,176 --> 00:44:19,766 A:middle
so you can give a
custom experience

846
00:44:20,436 --> 00:44:21,506 A:middle
through each of your segments.

847
00:44:23,056 --> 00:44:25,306 A:middle
So now when you have
those dormant users

848
00:44:25,306 --> 00:44:28,916 A:middle
who didn't use your
app, you can re-engage

849
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,856 A:middle
with those users
with that segment.

850
00:44:31,566 --> 00:44:34,626 A:middle
Show them a custom message,
motivate them to come back

851
00:44:34,626 --> 00:44:35,526 A:middle
and try your app again.

852
00:44:36,026 --> 00:44:40,966 A:middle
And when you have users who
have reached a certain level

853
00:44:41,216 --> 00:44:43,026 A:middle
and you want to push
them to the next level,

854
00:44:44,096 --> 00:44:46,946 A:middle
you can create a
segment of the users

855
00:44:46,946 --> 00:44:48,746 A:middle
who have reached say level 2.

856
00:44:48,996 --> 00:44:51,946 A:middle
Show them a custom
message about level 3.

857
00:44:52,706 --> 00:44:56,306 A:middle
When they engage with
that, take them to level 3,

858
00:44:57,306 --> 00:45:01,886 A:middle
not open the app, deep link
them directly to level 3.

859

860
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

861
00:44:57,306 --> 00:45:01,886 A:middle
not open the app, deep link
them directly to level 3.

862
00:45:02,336 --> 00:45:05,706 A:middle
And those users who
had an abundant cart

863
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:08,976 A:middle
in your retail app,
you can now re-engage

864
00:45:09,136 --> 00:45:12,156 A:middle
or retarget those
users irrespective

865
00:45:12,156 --> 00:45:17,216 A:middle
of what device they are on and
bring them back to your app.

866
00:45:17,976 --> 00:45:23,176 A:middle
And not only bring them
back, deep link them directly

867
00:45:23,666 --> 00:45:24,486 A:middle
to the shopping basket,

868
00:45:25,396 --> 00:45:30,256 A:middle
so in the next step they
can finish the purchase.

869
00:45:30,356 --> 00:45:31,786 A:middle
So really anything is possible.

870
00:45:32,586 --> 00:45:37,046 A:middle
For each of your segments, you
can create that awesome message

871
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:40,746 A:middle
and take the user to
wherever you want in the app

872
00:45:41,306 --> 00:45:42,366 A:middle
or even to any website.

873
00:45:43,346 --> 00:45:45,096 A:middle
Now that's not it.

874
00:45:46,066 --> 00:45:49,656 A:middle
With audience retargeting,
we'll actually find those users

875
00:45:49,656 --> 00:45:52,756 A:middle
for you on any iOS device.

876
00:45:54,696 --> 00:45:58,106 A:middle
So now when you had that example
but you introduce your iPad app,

877
00:45:58,536 --> 00:46:03,736 A:middle
a new app, now you can
find you iPhone app users

878

879
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

880
00:45:58,536 --> 00:46:03,736 A:middle
a new app, now you can
find you iPhone app users

881
00:46:04,976 --> 00:46:06,096 A:middle
when they're on the iPad.

882
00:46:06,546 --> 00:46:11,326 A:middle
So what we are introducing
here is a cross-app,

883
00:46:12,726 --> 00:46:14,656 A:middle
cross-device retargeting.

884
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:16,656 A:middle
That is huge.

885
00:46:18,556 --> 00:46:20,726 A:middle
What else is unique about this?

886
00:46:20,976 --> 00:46:24,186 A:middle
The first thing is
automation that comes with it.

887
00:46:25,036 --> 00:46:28,536 A:middle
When you build segments
using iOS 8,

888
00:46:29,296 --> 00:46:32,056 A:middle
your segments are automatically
updated in real-time.

889
00:46:33,396 --> 00:46:38,126 A:middle
No more of manually harvesting
idea phase, sharing them

890
00:46:38,126 --> 00:46:39,026 A:middle
with your network partners.

891
00:46:40,546 --> 00:46:43,716 A:middle
Your data is most secure
when it's in one place.

892
00:46:43,716 --> 00:46:47,536 A:middle
And there's no better
place than Apple iAd.

893
00:46:47,536 --> 00:46:51,266 A:middle
When you create segments this
way, segmentation is automated,

894
00:46:52,106 --> 00:46:54,786 A:middle
audience insights run
based on segmentation,

895
00:46:55,616 --> 00:46:58,206 A:middle
that's real-time updated as well

896
00:46:58,206 --> 00:47:01,606 A:middle
as the audience retargeting
is updated in real-time.

897

898
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

899
00:46:58,206 --> 00:47:01,606 A:middle
as the audience retargeting
is updated in real-time.

900
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:06,406 A:middle
The next thing is Privacy.

901
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:09,606 A:middle
Audience retargeting and this
entire solution we talked

902
00:47:09,606 --> 00:47:12,646 A:middle
about is deeply integrated
with iOS.

903
00:47:13,436 --> 00:47:15,576 A:middle
So you get all the benefits

904
00:47:15,706 --> 00:47:18,136 A:middle
of the built-in privacy
controls that come with it.

905
00:47:18,576 --> 00:47:21,726 A:middle
The solution complies with
the Limit Ad Tracking.

906
00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:26,496 A:middle
So now if you have a user
who has Limit Ad Tracking on,

907
00:47:26,966 --> 00:47:30,256 A:middle
that user is removed
automatically from the segments.

908
00:47:31,346 --> 00:47:33,006 A:middle
So the user is not retargeted.

909
00:47:34,346 --> 00:47:35,476 A:middle
Everything is automated.

910
00:47:36,306 --> 00:47:37,396 A:middle
You have nothing to worry about.

911
00:47:37,836 --> 00:47:42,756 A:middle
So with Audience
Segmentation, Audience Insights,

912
00:47:43,316 --> 00:47:45,516 A:middle
and Audience Retargeting,

913
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:50,186 A:middle
iAd becomes-iAd Workbench
becomes a complete solution.

914
00:47:51,256 --> 00:47:54,616 A:middle
You can, not only acquire
new users and new customers,

915
00:47:55,246 --> 00:47:59,566 A:middle
you can now understand your
existing users and re-engage

916
00:47:59,566 --> 00:48:01,336 A:middle
with them to grow your business.

917

918
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

919
00:47:59,566 --> 00:48:01,336 A:middle
with them to grow your business.

920
00:48:02,766 --> 00:48:03,466 A:middle
What else is coming?

921
00:48:04,096 --> 00:48:07,256 A:middle
We'll be introducing two
new ad formats this fall.

922
00:48:08,356 --> 00:48:11,546 A:middle
Interstitial ads which are also
called as fullscreen banners

923
00:48:12,686 --> 00:48:15,346 A:middle
and Medium Rectangle
also call as MREC.

924
00:48:16,646 --> 00:48:18,556 A:middle
Both these ad formats
will be available

925
00:48:18,556 --> 00:48:20,706 A:middle
on iPad as well as on iPhone.

926
00:48:21,776 --> 00:48:24,926 A:middle
So with that, you will have
four ad formats to choose:

927
00:48:25,286 --> 00:48:30,346 A:middle
the banner ads, video ads,
interstitials and MREC.

928
00:48:32,256 --> 00:48:33,366 A:middle
The next is we're going

929
00:48:33,366 --> 00:48:36,556 A:middle
to continue enhancing
the iAd Workbench APIs.

930
00:48:37,476 --> 00:48:39,876 A:middle
We'll introduce iAd
Workbench API 2.0

931
00:48:40,156 --> 00:48:42,866 A:middle
which will give you a
full read-write campaign

932
00:48:42,866 --> 00:48:43,896 A:middle
creation capability.

933
00:48:45,266 --> 00:48:47,576 A:middle
So if you work with a
Demand Side Partner,

934
00:48:47,576 --> 00:48:51,886 A:middle
also called as DSP, you
can now have your DSP plug

935
00:48:51,886 --> 00:48:55,876 A:middle
into iAd Workbench and
create and manage campaigns

936
00:48:55,876 --> 00:48:59,066 A:middle
on your behalf from their
own UI ad interface.

937
00:48:59,326 --> 00:49:01,176 A:middle
That's a move towards
programmatic buying,

938

939
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

940
00:48:59,326 --> 00:49:01,176 A:middle
That's a move towards
programmatic buying,

941
00:49:02,016 --> 00:49:04,946 A:middle
automated way of
booking campaigns

942
00:49:04,946 --> 00:49:06,506 A:middle
and managing them
from your own UI.

943
00:49:06,756 --> 00:49:09,246 A:middle
We'll also provide you APIs
for segmentation that we talked

944
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:10,776 A:middle
about just in-a little bit ago.

945
00:49:11,536 --> 00:49:13,746 A:middle
And finally, we'll continue
with the geo expansion.

946
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,736 A:middle
We'll go in more countries
and there is bunch more things

947
00:49:16,736 --> 00:49:17,716 A:middle
that we have in plans for you.

948
00:49:18,216 --> 00:49:22,976 A:middle
So to summarize, as
you saw in the demos

949
00:49:22,976 --> 00:49:25,946 A:middle
and throughout the talk, iAd
Workbench is the simplest way

950
00:49:25,946 --> 00:49:27,416 A:middle
for you to reach Apple users.

951
00:49:27,916 --> 00:49:31,276 A:middle
It's very powerful and
it's open to everyone.

952
00:49:31,906 --> 00:49:34,436 A:middle
So if you haven't tried
iAd Workbench yet,

953
00:49:35,396 --> 00:49:41,246 A:middle
go to iadworkbench.apple.com and
log in with just your Apple ID.

954
00:49:41,446 --> 00:49:44,126 A:middle
Make sure you take advantage of
the APIs that we reviewed today.

955
00:49:44,786 --> 00:49:47,166 A:middle
And the new ad formats
that are available now

956
00:49:47,376 --> 00:49:48,166 A:middle
and coming in fall.

957
00:49:49,526 --> 00:49:53,366 A:middle
And finally, the key thing,
make sure you enable your app

958
00:49:54,636 --> 00:49:58,126 A:middle
for segmentation so you
can get those free insights

959
00:49:58,126 --> 00:50:01,046 A:middle
that we just talked about
and you can also re-engage

960

961
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

962
00:49:58,126 --> 00:50:01,046 A:middle
that we just talked about
and you can also re-engage

963
00:50:01,446 --> 00:50:02,476 A:middle
with your current customers.

964
00:50:04,046 --> 00:50:06,846 A:middle
If you have more
questions, please reach

965
00:50:06,846 --> 00:50:08,836 A:middle
out to our evangelist,
Mark Malone.

966
00:50:09,356 --> 00:50:16,816 A:middle
We have lots of documentation
on iAd Online Workbench Help.

967
00:50:17,376 --> 00:50:21,126 A:middle
And you can also find us in
the Apple Developer Forum.

968
00:50:21,656 --> 00:50:26,186 A:middle
There was a session which
is very related to some

969
00:50:26,186 --> 00:50:27,896 A:middle
of the things that we
talked about today.

970
00:50:27,896 --> 00:50:29,076 A:middle
It was yesterday.

971
00:50:29,076 --> 00:50:32,416 A:middle
In case you missed it, make
sure you watch it later on.

972
00:50:33,486 --> 00:50:34,986 A:middle
In that session,
we talked about how

973
00:50:34,986 --> 00:50:36,966 A:middle
to use the API for segmentation.

974
00:50:36,966 --> 00:50:38,156 A:middle
So if you're interested in that,

975
00:50:38,156 --> 00:50:40,496 A:middle
make sure you take
a look at that.

976
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:40,886 A:middle
That's it.

977
00:50:41,296 --> 00:50:43,386 A:middle
Thank you and have a great WWDC.

978
