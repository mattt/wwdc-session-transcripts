00:00:11,516 --> 00:00:15,736 A:middle
[ Applause ]

2
00:00:16,236 --> 00:00:17,206 A:middle
>> Hi, everybody.

3
00:00:17,356 --> 00:00:18,106 A:middle
Good morning.

4
00:00:18,256 --> 00:00:21,286 A:middle
My name is Rachel
Roth and I'm one

5
00:00:21,286 --> 00:00:23,556 A:middle
of Apple's User Experience
Evangelists.

6
00:00:24,746 --> 00:00:28,366 A:middle
Now this session is
not about monetizing.

7
00:00:28,876 --> 00:00:33,846 A:middle
It's about having a great
experience with in-app purchases

8
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:36,716 A:middle
because a great experience
is what's going

9
00:00:36,716 --> 00:00:39,966 A:middle
to keep people coming back
to your app or game time

10
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:41,836 A:middle
and time and time again.

11
00:00:42,746 --> 00:00:45,616 A:middle
Think about the last time you
had a really fantastic meal

12
00:00:45,616 --> 00:00:46,726 A:middle
at a great restaurant.

13
00:00:47,496 --> 00:00:49,666 A:middle
So it's a place you always
want to come back to, right?

14
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:54,376 A:middle
So this is the bigger
picture of what it takes

15
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:57,066 A:middle
to have a great experience
with in-app purchases

16
00:00:57,786 --> 00:01:01,466 A:middle
and today's session is all
based on the assumption

17

18
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

19
00:00:57,786 --> 00:01:01,466 A:middle
and today's session is all
based on the assumption

20
00:01:01,556 --> 00:01:05,296 A:middle
that you already have a
really amazing app or game.

21
00:01:06,756 --> 00:01:09,636 A:middle
Your app meets the
needs of your audience.

22
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,566 A:middle
It's got a really
intuitive interface design.

23
00:01:13,046 --> 00:01:14,636 A:middle
It's been executed really well.

24
00:01:15,586 --> 00:01:17,326 A:middle
For game, it's just fun to play.

25
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:20,046 A:middle
And there's really
no design secrets

26
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,546 A:middle
or shortcuts around this one.

27
00:01:21,906 --> 00:01:23,746 A:middle
But I know that you guys
all have it handled.

28
00:01:24,346 --> 00:01:27,316 A:middle
So we don't have to dwell
on this for too long.

29
00:01:27,906 --> 00:01:30,606 A:middle
Now, if you're using the
freemium or the paymium model

30
00:01:30,606 --> 00:01:33,456 A:middle
with in-app purchases,
it's so important

31
00:01:33,456 --> 00:01:37,756 A:middle
that people can enjoy your app
or game without buying anything.

32
00:01:38,626 --> 00:01:40,866 A:middle
I mean, I think most of us
have had the experience.

33
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:43,746 A:middle
You get a new app from the
App Store and you download it

34
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:45,846 A:middle
and you launch it only to find

35
00:01:45,846 --> 00:01:47,516 A:middle
that you can't do
anything with it.

36
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,476 A:middle
That's frustrating.

37
00:01:49,706 --> 00:01:51,326 A:middle
You need to make it
a purchase in order

38
00:01:51,326 --> 00:01:52,866 A:middle
to get some utility out of it.

39
00:01:54,116 --> 00:01:57,086 A:middle
It would be like if you bought
a mixer for your kitchen

40
00:01:57,086 --> 00:01:59,316 A:middle
and it didn't come
with any attachments.

41
00:01:59,316 --> 00:02:01,166 A:middle
You couldn't mix anything.

42

43
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

44
00:01:59,316 --> 00:02:01,166 A:middle
You couldn't mix anything.

45
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:03,626 A:middle
That would be really
disappointing.

46
00:02:04,176 --> 00:02:07,546 A:middle
And that's why mixers come
with a basic attachment

47
00:02:07,546 --> 00:02:10,776 A:middle
that you can use to mix and
see how great the mixer is.

48
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:14,986 A:middle
And then you buy some additional
attachments for specialty tasks

49
00:02:14,986 --> 00:02:17,796 A:middle
like making bread or
some kind of pastry.

50
00:02:18,656 --> 00:02:21,146 A:middle
And that's what you want
to achieve with your apps.

51
00:02:21,406 --> 00:02:24,586 A:middle
You want to let people really
enjoy the functionality

52
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:28,466 A:middle
and the utility, the
quality of your app,

53
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:30,666 A:middle
and then you offer
them advantages

54
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:34,676 A:middle
or additional functionality,
some advanced features.

55
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:38,226 A:middle
And when you offer those
things, you want to make sure

56
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:39,766 A:middle
that you make buying easy.

57
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:43,996 A:middle
And I know this probably sounds
obvious but I'm not just talking

58
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:46,986 A:middle
about sending the
transaction to the App Store

59
00:02:46,986 --> 00:02:48,056 A:middle
and getting a response back.

60
00:02:48,996 --> 00:02:50,686 A:middle
You want to make sure
that the decision

61
00:02:50,686 --> 00:02:52,906 A:middle
to buy something is really easy

62
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,816 A:middle
for the people coming
to your app or game.

63
00:02:55,796 --> 00:03:00,896 A:middle
There's a lot of friction to
making that decision to buy

64

65
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

66
00:02:55,796 --> 00:03:00,896 A:middle
There's a lot of friction to
making that decision to buy

67
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,456 A:middle
and a lot of it is
outside of your control.

68
00:03:04,586 --> 00:03:08,066 A:middle
But as app developers, you
want to eliminate any obstacle

69
00:03:08,306 --> 00:03:09,306 A:middle
to making that decision

70
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:11,356 A:middle
to purchase something
inside of your app.

71
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:14,976 A:middle
Make it easy as possible
because that decision

72
00:03:14,976 --> 00:03:19,136 A:middle
to buy is a fleeting moment
and there's many traps.

73
00:03:20,156 --> 00:03:23,346 A:middle
So one of the best
things that you can do is

74
00:03:23,346 --> 00:03:25,926 A:middle
to integrate your merchandise
into the experience.

75
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:28,626 A:middle
I mean, people aren't
going to buy things

76
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:30,206 A:middle
if they don't know
what you're offering,

77
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:31,456 A:middle
if they can't see them.

78
00:03:32,356 --> 00:03:34,146 A:middle
I talk to a lot of developers

79
00:03:34,226 --> 00:03:37,476 A:middle
who create a really great store
section inside of their app

80
00:03:37,476 --> 00:03:39,426 A:middle
or game and then they're
really disappointed

81
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:40,716 A:middle
because no one's going there.

82
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:42,146 A:middle
They're not buying anything.

83
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:44,546 A:middle
That's because people don't
know what you're offering.

84
00:03:45,216 --> 00:03:47,046 A:middle
It's kind of like the
difference of if I said,

85
00:03:47,046 --> 00:03:49,026 A:middle
"Do you want to buy something?"

86
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:51,936 A:middle
Or if I said, "How would you

87
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,656 A:middle
like a really great
drawing tool?"

88
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:58,126 A:middle
And that's what you want to
help explain with your app

89
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,186 A:middle
by putting the merchandise
out on display,

90

91
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

92
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,186 A:middle
by putting the merchandise
out on display,

93
00:04:00,876 --> 00:04:02,876 A:middle
integrating it into
the experience.

94
00:04:03,846 --> 00:04:06,366 A:middle
But when you're doing
that, I'm not suggesting

95
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:08,906 A:middle
that you become a pushy
salesperson about it.

96
00:04:09,386 --> 00:04:12,606 A:middle
Nobody wants this guy following
them around saying, "Hey,

97
00:04:12,606 --> 00:04:13,676 A:middle
you want to buy something?

98
00:04:13,676 --> 00:04:14,706 A:middle
Hey, hey, hey.

99
00:04:14,706 --> 00:04:15,546 A:middle
You want to buy something?

100
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,606 A:middle
Do you want to buy something?

101
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:17,555 A:middle
Do you want to buy something?"

102
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:20,296 A:middle
Every minute, and that's
what you're risking

103
00:04:20,296 --> 00:04:23,276 A:middle
if you're flashing a lot
of alerts or notifications

104
00:04:23,276 --> 00:04:26,486 A:middle
or crazy animations to try and
entice people into that store.

105
00:04:27,956 --> 00:04:29,876 A:middle
It's really about timing.

106
00:04:30,526 --> 00:04:32,676 A:middle
And with some apps, it's

107
00:04:32,676 --> 00:04:35,956 A:middle
about offering the right
thing at the right time.

108
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,476 A:middle
Like at a restaurant, when the
waiter brings you the dessert

109
00:04:39,476 --> 00:04:40,556 A:middle
menu at the end of the meal.

110
00:04:41,606 --> 00:04:43,796 A:middle
I mean, you might not
even want dessert, right,

111
00:04:43,926 --> 00:04:45,706 A:middle
but it doesn't feel pushy
that they offered it.

112
00:04:47,116 --> 00:04:50,116 A:middle
It would feel pushy if they
offered it to you before you sat

113
00:04:50,116 --> 00:04:52,766 A:middle
down and while you're
eating your appetizer.

114
00:04:53,796 --> 00:04:56,136 A:middle
So you want to think about
what's the right moment

115
00:04:56,136 --> 00:04:58,486 A:middle
to offer something
to someone and do

116
00:04:58,486 --> 00:04:59,896 A:middle
that in a way that's
really thoughtful.

117

118
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

119
00:05:01,196 --> 00:05:04,196 A:middle
Now with other apps, it's
about the presentation.

120
00:05:05,186 --> 00:05:08,376 A:middle
You want to think about a
really great window display

121
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:09,206 A:middle
for a store.

122
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:11,636 A:middle
I happen to be very partial

123
00:05:11,636 --> 00:05:13,516 A:middle
to the Apple Retail
window displays.

124
00:05:13,696 --> 00:05:15,736 A:middle
I'm sure that will come as
no surprise to you guys.

125
00:05:17,236 --> 00:05:18,616 A:middle
Now they do a great job

126
00:05:18,616 --> 00:05:21,306 A:middle
of showing off the
merchandise and drawing you in.

127
00:05:21,426 --> 00:05:23,596 A:middle
It makes you want to find
out more about the products.

128
00:05:23,596 --> 00:05:24,776 A:middle
It's really intriguing.

129
00:05:25,496 --> 00:05:26,976 A:middle
And that's what you
want to think

130
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:28,586 A:middle
about with your app
or your game.

131
00:05:29,176 --> 00:05:31,216 A:middle
You want to integrate
the merchandise in a way

132
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:32,756 A:middle
that feels really natural.

133
00:05:34,216 --> 00:05:36,736 A:middle
This is Paper by Fifty Three.

134
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,586 A:middle
It's an Apple Design Award
winner from years ago

135
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:41,906 A:middle
that is still a fantastic
example

136
00:05:41,996 --> 00:05:45,396 A:middle
of integrating in-app
purchases into their experience.

137
00:05:46,286 --> 00:05:49,806 A:middle
If you haven't used it, the app
is designed to capture ideas

138
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:52,596 A:middle
through sketches and
diagrams and notes.

139
00:05:53,726 --> 00:05:55,656 A:middle
And like that mixer
in your kitchen,

140
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:58,246 A:middle
they give you some basic
drawing tools for free,

141
00:05:59,016 --> 00:06:00,446 A:middle
your pen and your eraser.

142

143
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

144
00:05:59,016 --> 00:06:00,446 A:middle
your pen and your eraser.

145
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:02,946 A:middle
And you can see from
this example

146
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,386 A:middle
that you can do tons with it.

147
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:06,446 A:middle
But there might be an occasion

148
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:09,306 A:middle
when you need a more advanced
drawing tool or a different kind

149
00:06:09,306 --> 00:06:13,746 A:middle
of line or texture and so that's
why they leave these empty spots

150
00:06:13,746 --> 00:06:16,226 A:middle
here where the advanced
drawing tools should go.

151
00:06:17,016 --> 00:06:19,626 A:middle
And that's like that
window display in the store.

152
00:06:20,216 --> 00:06:21,606 A:middle
It's putting them
out for you to see.

153
00:06:21,606 --> 00:06:24,026 A:middle
There's no question
what's available.

154
00:06:24,756 --> 00:06:27,536 A:middle
What they didn't do
is hide everything

155
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:30,936 A:middle
in an arts supply store or
tuck it in a pencil case

156
00:06:30,936 --> 00:06:33,836 A:middle
that then you have to go push
open to see what's available.

157
00:06:33,836 --> 00:06:35,186 A:middle
That's creating friction.

158
00:06:35,326 --> 00:06:38,356 A:middle
That's expecting the
player, or your audience

159
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,836 A:middle
to do work, to see what's there.

160
00:06:40,386 --> 00:06:44,956 A:middle
And another thing that
they didn't do is trick you

161
00:06:44,956 --> 00:06:47,106 A:middle
into thinking that you
already owned all these tools.

162
00:06:47,826 --> 00:06:50,486 A:middle
Because if you could see them
all but then when you tapped

163
00:06:50,486 --> 00:06:52,666 A:middle
on one to use it, it
told you that you need

164
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:55,006 A:middle
to pay money just
to test out a brush?

165
00:06:55,436 --> 00:06:56,696 A:middle
Well, that would
be disappointing.

166
00:06:57,056 --> 00:06:58,916 A:middle
That's not a great experience.

167
00:06:58,916 --> 00:06:59,926 A:middle
It's a frustrating one.

168

169
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

170
00:07:00,476 --> 00:07:05,016 A:middle
And that's why this design
is so elegant and so great.

171
00:07:05,456 --> 00:07:07,876 A:middle
It's informative
but it's not pushy.

172
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:13,346 A:middle
Now next up, let's look at that
timing I mentioned earlier,

173
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:16,176 A:middle
a totally different kind of
app, Bloomberg Businessweek.

174
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,716 A:middle
And this is a business
publication

175
00:07:18,716 --> 00:07:20,936 A:middle
that has regular
updates, new content.

176
00:07:21,756 --> 00:07:25,366 A:middle
And without a subscription, you
can still browse, read several

177
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:27,856 A:middle
of the articles,
browse all the headlines

178
00:07:27,856 --> 00:07:31,146 A:middle
and the introductory sentences.

179
00:07:31,336 --> 00:07:34,696 A:middle
Now if you tap on something
that requires a subscription,

180
00:07:35,806 --> 00:07:37,396 A:middle
they bring up the
subscription options.

181
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:39,606 A:middle
It's like the dessert menu.

182
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,466 A:middle
You're interested in
reading some of their content

183
00:07:42,906 --> 00:07:47,686 A:middle
so here's the information about
subscription so you can get it.

184
00:07:49,196 --> 00:07:51,776 A:middle
They're presenting it right
at that perfect moment.

185
00:07:53,346 --> 00:07:56,056 A:middle
They're making it easy for
you to get the subscription.

186
00:07:58,116 --> 00:08:01,206 A:middle
Now, they also have this
Subscribe button down here

187

188
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

189
00:07:58,116 --> 00:08:01,206 A:middle
Now, they also have this
Subscribe button down here

190
00:08:01,206 --> 00:08:05,066 A:middle
in the corner of every
screen and that's great too.

191
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:07,506 A:middle
But having that in addition

192
00:08:07,606 --> 00:08:10,226 A:middle
to the integrated message
helps them reach more people.

193
00:08:11,256 --> 00:08:13,616 A:middle
So I'm not saying you
can't have a store section.

194
00:08:14,116 --> 00:08:15,936 A:middle
You just don't want to
make it the only place

195
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:18,336 A:middle
that people can find
what you're offering.

196
00:08:20,706 --> 00:08:23,036 A:middle
Now this also works for games.

197
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:25,456 A:middle
I don't know how many of
you have played "Smash Hit".

198
00:08:25,556 --> 00:08:29,266 A:middle
It's a really fun arcade game
that involves smashing things

199
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:33,086 A:middle
as you might have guessed, very
satisfying after a long day.

200
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:37,106 A:middle
The way that it works is
that it's an arcade game

201
00:08:37,186 --> 00:08:39,046 A:middle
and the more accurate you
are at smashing things,

202
00:08:39,046 --> 00:08:39,956 A:middle
the further you're going to get.

203
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,316 A:middle
You progress through the
checkpoints unlocking them.

204
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:46,076 A:middle
And they also offer a premium
version and they've a great way

205
00:08:46,076 --> 00:08:47,686 A:middle
of illustrating exactly what

206
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:48,886 A:middle
that advanced feature
does for you.

207
00:08:49,516 --> 00:08:52,056 A:middle
[ Music ]

208
00:08:52,556 --> 00:08:53,316 A:middle
So here we are.

209
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:54,766 A:middle
Let's start from checkpoint 2,

210
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:56,976 A:middle
maybe I can get a little
bit further this time.

211
00:08:57,516 --> 00:09:00,626 A:middle
[ Music ]

212

213
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

214
00:08:57,516 --> 00:09:00,626 A:middle
[ Music ]

215
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:03,186 A:middle
Oh, but this requires
the premium version

216
00:09:03,186 --> 00:09:03,976 A:middle
and I'm not ready to buy it.

217
00:09:04,516 --> 00:09:07,696 A:middle
[ Music ]

218
00:09:08,196 --> 00:09:09,626 A:middle
Pretty compelling, right?

219
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:13,006 A:middle
I mean, if you had any doubt
about what that advantage is

220
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:15,046 A:middle
that they're offering,
that spells it

221
00:09:15,046 --> 00:09:16,186 A:middle
out for you right away.

222
00:09:17,786 --> 00:09:19,296 A:middle
Now I don't know how
many of you notice

223
00:09:19,296 --> 00:09:21,336 A:middle
that there's also this
Get Premium button here

224
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:22,126 A:middle
in the corner.

225
00:09:22,746 --> 00:09:26,626 A:middle
And if you did, would
you have guessed

226
00:09:26,626 --> 00:09:28,196 A:middle
that that's what the
premium version meant?

227
00:09:28,826 --> 00:09:31,866 A:middle
I mean, some of you might
have tapped on it to find out

228
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:33,486 A:middle
and some of you may not have.

229
00:09:34,636 --> 00:09:36,696 A:middle
And they have the details
here about what you get.

230
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:38,936 A:middle
But having this in addition

231
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:42,936 A:middle
to that integrated message
is just much more effective

232
00:09:43,156 --> 00:09:46,816 A:middle
at explaining what the feature
does for you and offering it

233
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:50,966 A:middle
to you at the time
that you can use it.

234
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:54,016 A:middle
Just remember, don't
be this guy.

235
00:09:54,936 --> 00:09:58,636 A:middle
Nobody wants someone pushing
in your face pestering you.

236
00:09:59,756 --> 00:10:02,776 A:middle
Pestering people is not going to
get the results that you want.

237

238
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

239
00:09:59,756 --> 00:10:02,776 A:middle
Pestering people is not going to
get the results that you want.

240
00:10:03,376 --> 00:10:05,746 A:middle
But thoughtful integration
of the merchandise will.

241
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:11,916 A:middle
Now another challenge is to
help people understand the value

242
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,026 A:middle
of what you're offering.

243
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:16,076 A:middle
And if you walked
into a clothing store,

244
00:10:16,076 --> 00:10:17,596 A:middle
this is easy to figure out.

245
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:21,256 A:middle
You can touch the merchandise,
feel what the fabric feels like.

246
00:10:21,926 --> 00:10:25,076 A:middle
Does it feel luxurious or
does it feel kind of cheap?

247
00:10:26,046 --> 00:10:26,846 A:middle
Is it well made?

248
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,186 A:middle
Are the seams are falling apart?

249
00:10:29,156 --> 00:10:30,626 A:middle
Most importantly,
does it fit you?

250
00:10:30,956 --> 00:10:31,656 A:middle
Does it look good?

251
00:10:31,656 --> 00:10:33,026 A:middle
Is it going to suit
your purposes?

252
00:10:34,686 --> 00:10:36,166 A:middle
So letting people try

253
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:39,656 A:middle
out merchandise before they buy
it is a really effective way

254
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:42,636 A:middle
of helping them understand
the quality and the value

255
00:10:42,636 --> 00:10:45,256 A:middle
and the utility of
what you're offering.

256
00:10:46,176 --> 00:10:48,906 A:middle
I mean, you wouldn't buy
a car without taking it

257
00:10:48,906 --> 00:10:50,676 A:middle
for a test drive first, right?

258
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:52,546 A:middle
It's the same principle.

259
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:55,796 A:middle
Letting people use it will
be the best way for them

260
00:10:55,796 --> 00:10:57,716 A:middle
to understand how
awesome they are.

261
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:02,466 A:middle
And again, Paper by Fifty Three
does a great job with this.

262

263
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

264
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:02,466 A:middle
And again, Paper by Fifty Three
does a great job with this.

265
00:11:03,506 --> 00:11:05,906 A:middle
In addition to providing
a lot of samples

266
00:11:05,906 --> 00:11:08,086 A:middle
of what the tools
are capable of,

267
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:10,726 A:middle
they put together an
entire journal made

268
00:11:10,726 --> 00:11:13,466 A:middle
by their staff showing
off the different tools

269
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:14,456 A:middle
and their capabilities.

270
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:17,526 A:middle
And then of course, they
let you use the tools,

271
00:11:17,526 --> 00:11:18,966 A:middle
the basic tools for free.

272
00:11:19,976 --> 00:11:22,846 A:middle
And if you haven't used
this app, I can tell you

273
00:11:22,846 --> 00:11:25,326 A:middle
that the tools respond
beautifully to your finger.

274
00:11:25,906 --> 00:11:29,566 A:middle
Now me telling you that
isn't nearly as effective

275
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:33,466 A:middle
as you actually using the app
and so that's why when you go

276
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:35,376 A:middle
to find out about these
advanced drawing tools,

277
00:11:35,376 --> 00:11:36,926 A:middle
they let you test
them out right there.

278
00:11:38,116 --> 00:11:40,806 A:middle
You've got these sketch pads
along with detailed information

279
00:11:40,806 --> 00:11:44,976 A:middle
and testing them out is how
you can determine the quality

280
00:11:44,976 --> 00:11:45,776 A:middle
and the utility.

281
00:11:46,196 --> 00:11:47,826 A:middle
What kind of texture
do they provide?

282
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:50,146 A:middle
How do they react to your
finger when you're drawing?

283
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:51,966 A:middle
Which one is going to be right

284
00:11:51,966 --> 00:11:53,246 A:middle
for what you're trying
to achieve?

285
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:57,336 A:middle
And each of those sketch
pads has drawings already

286
00:11:57,336 --> 00:11:58,206 A:middle
in progress.

287
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,276 A:middle
It's kind of like the test
drive where they take you

288

289
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

290
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,276 A:middle
It's kind of like the test
drive where they take you

291
00:12:01,276 --> 00:12:03,816 A:middle
down certain roads to show
you how well the car handles?

292
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:07,046 A:middle
Paper by Fifty Three is
setting up the sketchpads

293
00:12:07,046 --> 00:12:09,146 A:middle
to show you the optimal uses

294
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,376 A:middle
or some suggested
uses for those tools.

295
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:13,366 A:middle
This one's great at watercolors.

296
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,376 A:middle
They've set up a
watercolor drawing for you

297
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:19,286 A:middle
so then you can jump in and add
on or try your own drawings.

298
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:24,016 A:middle
And it might seem obvious
to take this approach

299
00:12:24,016 --> 00:12:26,196 A:middle
with drawing tools but
I promise it will work

300
00:12:26,196 --> 00:12:28,136 A:middle
for almost any kind
of virtual good.

301
00:12:29,036 --> 00:12:31,746 A:middle
Here's a really different
example and that's Line.

302
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:34,256 A:middle
So it's a popular messaging app.

303
00:12:34,256 --> 00:12:37,486 A:middle
You can send and receive
messages for free.

304
00:12:38,436 --> 00:12:40,836 A:middle
Now one of the things
that differentiates Line

305
00:12:40,896 --> 00:12:44,516 A:middle
from its competitors
is the vast array

306
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:46,476 A:middle
of stickers that they offer.

307
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,276 A:middle
Stickers are kind of
like really crazy Emoji.

308
00:12:49,276 --> 00:12:52,386 A:middle
You can include them in your
messages and send them back

309
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:54,046 A:middle
and forth to your friends.

310
00:12:54,046 --> 00:12:56,146 A:middle
It gives your text
messages a whole new life.

311
00:12:57,436 --> 00:12:59,866 A:middle
Now Line gives you a
very generous selection

312
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:02,036 A:middle
of these stickers for
free so you can try them

313

314
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

315
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:02,036 A:middle
of these stickers for
free so you can try them

316
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:05,106 A:middle
out plus the ability
to earn stickers

317
00:13:05,106 --> 00:13:06,256 A:middle
without paying anything.

318
00:13:07,106 --> 00:13:09,556 A:middle
So all you have to do is
add Hello Kitty as a friend

319
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:10,986 A:middle
and then you get
Hello Kitty stickers.

320
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:13,506 A:middle
And some people love
Hello Kitty stickers.

321
00:13:14,246 --> 00:13:20,156 A:middle
And using them really helps you
understand how great they are.

322
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:24,066 A:middle
Now another thing that
they offer are themes.

323
00:13:24,686 --> 00:13:27,226 A:middle
And when I first investigated
themes, I'll be honest,

324
00:13:27,226 --> 00:13:30,106 A:middle
I had no idea what to expect
and I thought, "Oh great,

325
00:13:30,106 --> 00:13:31,106 A:middle
there's some free ones.

326
00:13:31,106 --> 00:13:32,516 A:middle
Let me try out the Brown Bear."

327
00:13:33,456 --> 00:13:34,786 A:middle
Let's see what happens here.

328
00:13:35,376 --> 00:13:37,906 A:middle
So when you choose
the Brown Bear theme,

329
00:13:37,906 --> 00:13:41,916 A:middle
instead of getting the
standard UI, you get bears!

330
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:45,236 A:middle
Hurray! Everywhere,
all over the place.

331
00:13:45,406 --> 00:13:47,606 A:middle
Even the tab bar
icons are bears.

332
00:13:49,116 --> 00:13:52,636 A:middle
Now, sure they could have put a
description of what a theme is

333
00:13:52,636 --> 00:13:55,286 A:middle
or even a screenshot but that
wouldn't have been nearly

334
00:13:55,286 --> 00:13:58,706 A:middle
as effective at conveying what
happens when you use the themes.

335
00:13:59,386 --> 00:14:02,766 A:middle
Giving people some free ones
to try out is the best way

336

337
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

338
00:13:59,386 --> 00:14:02,766 A:middle
Giving people some free ones
to try out is the best way

339
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:05,606 A:middle
to really understand
what they're all about.

340
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:09,306 A:middle
And this works for publications.

341
00:14:09,596 --> 00:14:11,226 A:middle
Does anyone have any
question about where

342
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,676 A:middle
to get the free preview
content on the screen?

343
00:14:14,056 --> 00:14:16,496 A:middle
They've made it really
easy for everybody.

344
00:14:17,896 --> 00:14:21,196 A:middle
"Esquire Magazine" wants
to make sure that you know

345
00:14:21,196 --> 00:14:22,476 A:middle
that reading their content

346
00:14:22,556 --> 00:14:25,346 A:middle
on an iPad is the best
experience possible.

347
00:14:25,746 --> 00:14:28,846 A:middle
And so they give you free
content to check out.

348
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:32,766 A:middle
It's got videos, interactivity
and this is the equivalent

349
00:14:32,766 --> 00:14:36,076 A:middle
to standing in line at the store
and flipping through a magazine

350
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,906 A:middle
or going to a comics store
and checking out the artwork.

351
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:42,356 A:middle
It helps you to really know
whether the reading experience

352
00:14:42,356 --> 00:14:44,366 A:middle
is going to be good and
whether the content's going

353
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:46,466 A:middle
to be something that
you're interested in.

354
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,956 A:middle
And again, this also
works for games.

355
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:53,566 A:middle
Now, I'm pretty sure
that everyone

356
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:56,556 A:middle
in this room has played Candy
Crush Saga at some point

357
00:14:56,906 --> 00:14:59,506 A:middle
but for the 2 of you who
haven't, it's a puzzle game.

358

359
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

360
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:05,256 A:middle
And they've done okay with
in-app purchases, you know.

361
00:15:05,256 --> 00:15:07,296 A:middle
So what they do at the
beginning of every level is

362
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:08,936 A:middle
that they offer you
these boosters.

363
00:15:08,936 --> 00:15:13,516 A:middle
And these boosters give you a
leg up on completing the task

364
00:15:13,516 --> 00:15:15,746 A:middle
and they've become much
more valuable the harder the

365
00:15:15,746 --> 00:15:16,436 A:middle
puzzle is.

366
00:15:17,526 --> 00:15:19,856 A:middle
And if you've never used one,
you can just ignore them,

367
00:15:20,226 --> 00:15:23,316 A:middle
go for that big pink play button
and you're into a puzzle game.

368
00:15:25,316 --> 00:15:28,326 A:middle
So that's why they introduced
the Daily Booster Wheel.

369
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:32,666 A:middle
Every day you can come and get
one of their boosters for free.

370
00:15:33,756 --> 00:15:37,306 A:middle
So there is nothing standing in
the way of you trying them out.

371
00:15:37,966 --> 00:15:39,386 A:middle
And once you try them out,

372
00:15:39,386 --> 00:15:41,656 A:middle
you really know what a
difference that they can make.

373
00:15:42,326 --> 00:15:46,596 A:middle
So that's what I mean about
offering a test drive.

374
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,066 A:middle
Letting someone really
experience that merchandise,

375
00:15:50,246 --> 00:15:53,226 A:middle
trying it out before they
buy it, is the best way

376
00:15:53,226 --> 00:15:57,386 A:middle
to communicate the value and
the usefulness and the quality.

377
00:15:57,976 --> 00:16:01,036 A:middle
And that's why it's going
to make the decision

378

379
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

380
00:15:57,976 --> 00:16:01,036 A:middle
And that's why it's going
to make the decision

381
00:16:01,036 --> 00:16:06,056 A:middle
to buy something
easier on people.

382
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:09,186 A:middle
Now, another way to reduce
the friction to buying is

383
00:16:09,186 --> 00:16:10,366 A:middle
to stick with your theme.

384
00:16:11,766 --> 00:16:14,836 A:middle
It's really important that
every screen in your app

385
00:16:14,836 --> 00:16:16,556 A:middle
or your game is cohesive.

386
00:16:16,556 --> 00:16:18,196 A:middle
And you want to carry

387
00:16:18,196 --> 00:16:20,486 A:middle
that visual design
all the way through.

388
00:16:20,806 --> 00:16:22,986 A:middle
That interaction model
needs to be consistent.

389
00:16:22,986 --> 00:16:26,826 A:middle
And you want to put as
much effort and time

390
00:16:27,206 --> 00:16:29,866 A:middle
into designing these screens
as you do anything else

391
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:33,176 A:middle
in your app or your game.

392
00:16:33,176 --> 00:16:36,806 A:middle
So this is Ruzzle Adventure
and it's got hundreds of levels

393
00:16:36,806 --> 00:16:39,366 A:middle
of puzzle games and all
these various theme worlds.

394
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:43,086 A:middle
You start out in the
forest and you work

395
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,126 A:middle
through the different
puzzles in the forest

396
00:16:45,126 --> 00:16:46,476 A:middle
to get to other lands.

397
00:16:47,226 --> 00:16:51,386 A:middle
Now, every aspect of the
forest looks like the forest.

398
00:16:51,826 --> 00:16:54,456 A:middle
They've got -- it doesn't matter
the objective of the game.

399
00:16:54,456 --> 00:16:58,086 A:middle
You can see the forest details
creeping in at every corner.

400
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:03,446 A:middle
Now there are in-app purchases
involved and in-app currency

401

402
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

403
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:03,446 A:middle
Now there are in-app purchases
involved and in-app currency

404
00:17:03,446 --> 00:17:06,685 A:middle
which you can use to
then buy advantages

405
00:17:06,836 --> 00:17:08,935 A:middle
for the different
levels, powerful boosts.

406
00:17:09,836 --> 00:17:12,476 A:middle
And you can earn the in-app
currency as you're playing

407
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:15,996 A:middle
but you can also, of course,
make an in-app purchase

408
00:17:15,996 --> 00:17:17,086 A:middle
for their in-app currency.

409
00:17:17,665 --> 00:17:20,506 A:middle
So imagine you're up against
Chief Smartypants here

410
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,506 A:middle
and he's tough.

411
00:17:22,536 --> 00:17:24,996 A:middle
So it might be worth
getting some in-app currency

412
00:17:25,406 --> 00:17:28,286 A:middle
so that you can -- so that you
go buy some in-app currency

413
00:17:28,286 --> 00:17:31,256 A:middle
so you can get some
of those boosters.

414
00:17:31,256 --> 00:17:32,786 A:middle
So imagine you're excited.

415
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:34,366 A:middle
You want to beat
Chief Smartypants.

416
00:17:35,046 --> 00:17:36,726 A:middle
But the next screen
you saw was this.

417
00:17:38,036 --> 00:17:39,306 A:middle
It would be terrible, right?

418
00:17:40,316 --> 00:17:42,886 A:middle
I mean, suddenly there's
an entirely different UI

419
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:44,426 A:middle
that you have to understand.

420
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,216 A:middle
You got to think about it.

421
00:17:46,216 --> 00:17:47,866 A:middle
It's really sterile-looking.

422
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,436 A:middle
It's not very well laid out.

423
00:17:50,766 --> 00:17:52,476 A:middle
It takes you right
out of the experience.

424
00:17:52,476 --> 00:17:53,816 A:middle
You're not in the
forest anymore.

425
00:17:54,936 --> 00:17:56,296 A:middle
And that creates friction.

426
00:17:56,726 --> 00:17:58,156 A:middle
It makes you feel
more like work.

427
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:00,786 A:middle
That's making it
harder to buy something.

428

429
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

430
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:00,786 A:middle
That's making it
harder to buy something.

431
00:18:01,786 --> 00:18:04,996 A:middle
Now thankfully, Ruzzle
Adventure does not do that.

432
00:18:05,936 --> 00:18:08,806 A:middle
They have a nice forest
theme purchasing experience

433
00:18:08,806 --> 00:18:11,656 A:middle
and all the visual design
and interaction is consistent

434
00:18:12,146 --> 00:18:14,686 A:middle
with everything else
in the game.

435
00:18:15,936 --> 00:18:19,436 A:middle
So make sure that you
maintain the world of your game

436
00:18:19,436 --> 00:18:22,226 A:middle
or the look of your app
on every single screen

437
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,956 A:middle
and with every single control.

438
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:27,436 A:middle
Because when you suddenly
snatch people out of that world

439
00:18:28,596 --> 00:18:31,246 A:middle
and they have to deal with a
new interface or a new look,

440
00:18:31,346 --> 00:18:32,596 A:middle
it's going to feel like work.

441
00:18:32,716 --> 00:18:34,196 A:middle
It's going to be hard.

442
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,696 A:middle
And buying, we want
it to be easy, right?

443
00:18:37,736 --> 00:18:41,676 A:middle
Now just a word of warning
while you are busy sticking

444
00:18:41,676 --> 00:18:44,156 A:middle
with your theme,
don't take it so far

445
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,046 A:middle
that language becomes confusing.

446
00:18:46,956 --> 00:18:47,666 A:middle
You want to make sure

447
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,176 A:middle
that people can really
understand exactly what they're

448
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:51,336 A:middle
going to be getting
for their money.

449
00:18:51,856 --> 00:18:53,066 A:middle
You use clear language.

450
00:18:54,506 --> 00:18:57,226 A:middle
Now have you guys ever seen a
description for an apartment

451
00:18:57,226 --> 00:19:00,046 A:middle
or house that said something
like "needs a little work"?

452

453
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

454
00:18:57,226 --> 00:19:00,046 A:middle
or house that said something
like "needs a little work"?

455
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:02,836 A:middle
And then you show up
and it's, you know,

456
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:03,876 A:middle
it looks more like this.

457
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:07,436 A:middle
I think we've all
had that experience.

458
00:19:07,806 --> 00:19:11,696 A:middle
Now with any purchase, it's
so important to be honest.

459
00:19:11,946 --> 00:19:14,826 A:middle
There is really a fine line
between trying to be positive

460
00:19:14,826 --> 00:19:16,746 A:middle
about something,
highlighting the features

461
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:19,076 A:middle
and really being
overly optimistic

462
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:20,156 A:middle
about what you're selling.

463
00:19:20,646 --> 00:19:23,666 A:middle
Nobody wants to be disappointed

464
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:26,636 A:middle
when they see what the
merchandise actually is.

465
00:19:27,146 --> 00:19:30,306 A:middle
And especially when you're
coming to subscriptions

466
00:19:30,306 --> 00:19:34,396 A:middle
or recurring content, you want
to be as specific as possible.

467
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:37,206 A:middle
Set people's expectations
correctly.

468
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,956 A:middle
When are they going
to get new content?

469
00:19:40,406 --> 00:19:42,216 A:middle
How much content are they
getting for the price?

470
00:19:42,946 --> 00:19:46,436 A:middle
And if you just saw something
like this, you don't know.

471
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,896 A:middle
Is it expensive or
is it a bargain?

472
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:52,026 A:middle
I mean, if it's 12
issues in a year,

473
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:53,566 A:middle
that's less than
a dollar an issue.

474
00:19:54,356 --> 00:19:55,946 A:middle
That's pretty reasonable, right?

475
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:59,596 A:middle
But if it's only two
issues, well, I don't know.

476

477
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

478
00:20:00,096 --> 00:20:03,116 A:middle
Is that content really
worth that much money to me

479
00:20:03,116 --> 00:20:05,566 A:middle
and see now, I'm off
thinking about whether

480
00:20:05,566 --> 00:20:08,146 A:middle
or not this is a purchase
I want to make instead

481
00:20:08,146 --> 00:20:11,466 A:middle
of quickly coming to a decision,
getting the new content

482
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:12,766 A:middle
and going off to enjoy it

483
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:14,816 A:middle
because that's what I've
come to an app to do.

484
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,756 A:middle
I've come to enjoy content.

485
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:19,226 A:middle
I've come to an app to
help me achieve something.

486
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:23,296 A:middle
Jamie Oliver does a much
better job with this.

487
00:20:23,296 --> 00:20:27,456 A:middle
He's a famous chef and
he has a recipes app.

488
00:20:27,906 --> 00:20:30,646 A:middle
And you'll see here that
here they let you know

489
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,206 A:middle
that new content is coming

490
00:20:32,206 --> 00:20:35,286 A:middle
on the second Wednesday
of every month.

491
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,156 A:middle
Crystal clear, very specific.

492
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:41,456 A:middle
I know exactly when
to expect things.

493
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:45,926 A:middle
FitStar is a personal
training application

494
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,536 A:middle
and they have a number of
workouts and they're tailored

495
00:20:49,636 --> 00:20:53,366 A:middle
to your goals and also
your actual performance.

496
00:20:54,226 --> 00:20:57,856 A:middle
Now their subscription screen
gives you detailed outlines

497
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:58,746 A:middle
of all the programs.

498
00:20:59,506 --> 00:21:02,276 A:middle
I mean, you can find out
the length of the workouts.

499

500
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

501
00:20:59,506 --> 00:21:02,276 A:middle
I mean, you can find out
the length of the workouts.

502
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:03,396 A:middle
Do you want something short?

503
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:04,536 A:middle
Do you want something long?

504
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:08,956 A:middle
They are offering both of
those, the advantages of them.

505
00:21:08,956 --> 00:21:11,596 A:middle
Are you interested in fat
burning or are you trying

506
00:21:11,596 --> 00:21:12,556 A:middle
to do strength training?

507
00:21:13,776 --> 00:21:17,126 A:middle
They've even pointed out which
one is recommended for me based

508
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:18,946 A:middle
on a couple of questions
I answered earlier.

509
00:21:19,506 --> 00:21:23,186 A:middle
And when you're ready to
buy that subscription,

510
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,486 A:middle
that screen is so clear about
exactly what you're going

511
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,606 A:middle
to be getting, all
of the programs,

512
00:21:29,796 --> 00:21:31,346 A:middle
unlimited free style moves.

513
00:21:32,146 --> 00:21:34,546 A:middle
And they've even highlighted
the annual subscription

514
00:21:34,936 --> 00:21:37,206 A:middle
with a discount.

515
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,356 A:middle
They've made it so easy
just through the use

516
00:21:40,356 --> 00:21:42,956 A:middle
of clear language for
me to make a decision

517
00:21:42,956 --> 00:21:44,046 A:middle
about buying something.

518
00:21:45,046 --> 00:21:47,446 A:middle
And now I really understand
what I'm getting for my money

519
00:21:47,486 --> 00:21:49,386 A:middle
and I can appreciate it.

520
00:21:49,946 --> 00:21:53,346 A:middle
Now another way that
you can make this clear

521
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:56,876 A:middle
to your audience is to
do the math for them.

522
00:21:57,106 --> 00:21:58,766 A:middle
I don't like doing math.

523
00:21:59,046 --> 00:22:00,036 A:middle
That's not fun for me.

524

525
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

526
00:21:59,046 --> 00:22:00,036 A:middle
That's not fun for me.

527
00:22:00,246 --> 00:22:01,176 A:middle
Don't make me do the math.

528
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,866 A:middle
It's your job as the app
developer to make it easy

529
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:06,196 A:middle
on people to make a decision.

530
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:10,016 A:middle
So quick, which one of
these is the best value?

531
00:22:11,116 --> 00:22:14,456 A:middle
I mean, I'm sure some of you can
really quickly calculate this

532
00:22:14,456 --> 00:22:16,226 A:middle
but most people are
not going to want to.

533
00:22:16,796 --> 00:22:18,016 A:middle
It's this one, by the way.

534
00:22:18,996 --> 00:22:22,966 A:middle
And so that's why you really
want to help people understand

535
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:26,266 A:middle
which is going to be the
most cost effective for them.

536
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:27,916 A:middle
This is Lovoo.

537
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:31,406 A:middle
It's a dating application and
they offer tons of utility

538
00:22:31,406 --> 00:22:32,766 A:middle
without a subscription.

539
00:22:32,766 --> 00:22:36,636 A:middle
You can fill out a
profile, message users.

540
00:22:36,636 --> 00:22:39,126 A:middle
There's lots of ways to
browse potential suitors,

541
00:22:39,536 --> 00:22:40,076 A:middle
including this.

542
00:22:40,076 --> 00:22:41,216 A:middle
This is a radar screen.

543
00:22:41,216 --> 00:22:42,276 A:middle
That's what you're seeing here.

544
00:22:42,336 --> 00:22:46,256 A:middle
You can see all the people,
all potential dates around me.

545
00:22:46,796 --> 00:22:50,876 A:middle
And of course, they have some
premium features that'll help

546
00:22:50,876 --> 00:22:52,356 A:middle
you get more exposure to people.

547
00:22:53,196 --> 00:22:57,286 A:middle
And here is how they explain
the subscription options.

548
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:01,956 A:middle
It's called pennies
a day to find love.

549

550
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

551
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:01,956 A:middle
It's called pennies
a day to find love.

552
00:23:02,446 --> 00:23:04,116 A:middle
Pennies a day to find love!

553
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,826 A:middle
Who can afford pennies
a day for love?

554
00:23:08,026 --> 00:23:09,856 A:middle
Now, there's no guesswork here.

555
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:12,696 A:middle
I know exactly which
subscription is going

556
00:23:12,696 --> 00:23:14,496 A:middle
to be the lowest cost per day.

557
00:23:14,806 --> 00:23:15,916 A:middle
But it's really important.

558
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,756 A:middle
If you're going to
take it to this level,

559
00:23:18,506 --> 00:23:19,846 A:middle
make sure that you're
still calling

560
00:23:19,846 --> 00:23:22,286 A:middle
out the total purchase
price because again,

561
00:23:22,286 --> 00:23:24,826 A:middle
we want to be honest and
clear with our language.

562
00:23:25,306 --> 00:23:28,016 A:middle
People are going to want to
know what they expect to pay.

563
00:23:28,286 --> 00:23:30,256 A:middle
Don't make them do the
math in reverse, right?

564
00:23:30,256 --> 00:23:34,796 A:middle
Now, if your app is available
worldwide, I want to make sure

565
00:23:34,796 --> 00:23:36,516 A:middle
that you localize your currency

566
00:23:36,836 --> 00:23:38,776 A:middle
because that's a huge
roadblock if you don't.

567
00:23:39,386 --> 00:23:44,456 A:middle
So that's what I mean about
doing the math for people.

568
00:23:44,596 --> 00:23:49,746 A:middle
It can be so helpful in
making that decision quickly.

569
00:23:50,576 --> 00:23:53,816 A:middle
Now, another thing that's really
helpful is showing fewer things.

570
00:23:54,336 --> 00:23:57,176 A:middle
It's about quality,
not about quantity.

571
00:23:57,856 --> 00:24:00,806 A:middle
Too many choices, you
risk overwhelming people.

572

573
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

574
00:23:57,856 --> 00:24:00,806 A:middle
Too many choices, you
risk overwhelming people.

575
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,236 A:middle
And I don't know how
many of you have heard

576
00:24:03,236 --> 00:24:04,866 A:middle
of the paradox of choice.

577
00:24:05,056 --> 00:24:08,176 A:middle
It essentially means that the
more choices that you have,

578
00:24:08,556 --> 00:24:10,236 A:middle
the harder it is
to make a decision.

579
00:24:10,236 --> 00:24:13,666 A:middle
And in fact, when
you've too many choices,

580
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:16,506 A:middle
that choice overload,
it stresses you out.

581
00:24:16,726 --> 00:24:17,816 A:middle
And what you, people wind

582
00:24:17,816 --> 00:24:20,276 A:middle
up doing is avoiding making
a decision altogether.

583
00:24:21,016 --> 00:24:24,236 A:middle
And you want people to make a
decision to purchase something.

584
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:29,026 A:middle
It's kind of like if you've
ever gone on to make a recipe

585
00:24:29,026 --> 00:24:30,916 A:middle
and it calls for apples.

586
00:24:31,316 --> 00:24:34,326 A:middle
Maybe you're making apple
pie and so you got your list.

587
00:24:34,326 --> 00:24:36,786 A:middle
You go to the grocery store and
then you're faced with this.

588
00:24:37,856 --> 00:24:39,056 A:middle
Well, what kind of apples?

589
00:24:39,056 --> 00:24:42,806 A:middle
Is it Golden Delicious
or Red Delicious

590
00:24:42,806 --> 00:24:45,346 A:middle
or Fuji or Pink Lady or oh!

591
00:24:45,856 --> 00:24:46,536 A:middle
It's too much!

592
00:24:46,806 --> 00:24:47,756 A:middle
It's overwhelming!

593
00:24:48,016 --> 00:24:49,196 A:middle
Too many apples!

594
00:24:49,746 --> 00:24:53,006 A:middle
And this will result in you just
abandoning that pie altogether.

595
00:24:53,006 --> 00:24:56,736 A:middle
You want to avoid that
reaction in your app.

596
00:24:57,616 --> 00:25:01,076 A:middle
Too many choices becomes
stressful and that's going

597

598
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

599
00:24:57,616 --> 00:25:01,076 A:middle
Too many choices becomes
stressful and that's going

600
00:25:01,076 --> 00:25:04,396 A:middle
to result in people avoiding the
purchase decision altogether.

601
00:25:04,986 --> 00:25:07,206 A:middle
So here is Match.

602
00:25:07,926 --> 00:25:09,976 A:middle
It's a different
dating application.

603
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,996 A:middle
Again, loads of utility
without subscription.

604
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:15,696 A:middle
More than letting you
test-drive the app.

605
00:25:15,696 --> 00:25:17,876 A:middle
They're practically
giving you an entire car.

606
00:25:18,326 --> 00:25:21,436 A:middle
You can fill out your profile,
message people, a million ways

607
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,826 A:middle
of browsing including
recommended partners.

608
00:25:24,726 --> 00:25:28,466 A:middle
They do offer some premium
features though and one

609
00:25:28,466 --> 00:25:30,676 A:middle
of the things is
seeing who's viewed me.

610
00:25:31,316 --> 00:25:34,366 A:middle
So tapping on that
viewed me button brings

611
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,836 A:middle
up their subscription choices.

612
00:25:36,406 --> 00:25:38,016 A:middle
So they're offering
me that information

613
00:25:38,016 --> 00:25:40,206 A:middle
at the time that I need it.

614
00:25:40,436 --> 00:25:43,236 A:middle
Now look, I've got
3 easy choices here.

615
00:25:43,866 --> 00:25:48,016 A:middle
They've even highlighted
the one with the best value.

616
00:25:48,016 --> 00:25:50,506 A:middle
3 choices is an easy
decision to make.

617
00:25:51,246 --> 00:25:55,496 A:middle
I don't have to scroll through
a long list of options or page

618
00:25:55,496 --> 00:25:56,926 A:middle
through screen after screen

619
00:25:56,926 --> 00:25:58,786 A:middle
with different subscription
numbers on it.

620
00:25:59,156 --> 00:26:00,696 A:middle
Then I have to remember
them in my head

621

622
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

623
00:25:59,156 --> 00:26:00,696 A:middle
Then I have to remember
them in my head

624
00:26:00,696 --> 00:26:01,856 A:middle
and try and figure it out.

625
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,806 A:middle
That makes it hard.

626
00:26:04,036 --> 00:26:06,056 A:middle
Buying things shouldn't be hard.

627
00:26:06,686 --> 00:26:11,626 A:middle
So fewer things all on one
screen, no paging, no scrolling.

628
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:18,066 A:middle
People want to be able to see
all their options at once.

629
00:26:19,386 --> 00:26:23,046 A:middle
Now, if someone's ready to
make that decision to buy,

630
00:26:23,046 --> 00:26:25,736 A:middle
they're ready to press that
buy button, you really want

631
00:26:25,736 --> 00:26:28,386 A:middle
to execute on it as
efficiently as possible.

632
00:26:28,946 --> 00:26:31,236 A:middle
I mean, have you ever gone
to get a cup of coffee

633
00:26:31,236 --> 00:26:34,436 A:middle
and then you're faced with
a long, slow-moving line?

634
00:26:34,436 --> 00:26:36,066 A:middle
And so, you're just
like, "Forget it."

635
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:40,216 A:middle
That's what you don't want to
happen in your app or game.

636
00:26:41,206 --> 00:26:44,946 A:middle
Minimizing both the time and the
number of steps that it takes

637
00:26:45,206 --> 00:26:48,666 A:middle
to make a purchase keeps people
really engaged in your app,

638
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:50,786 A:middle
not thinking about that
purchasing process.

639
00:26:51,496 --> 00:26:55,106 A:middle
So this is Supernauts.

640
00:26:55,106 --> 00:26:58,426 A:middle
It's a builder game that
takes place in space.

641
00:26:58,976 --> 00:27:02,006 A:middle
It's not quite out worldwide
yet so stayed tuned very soon

642

643
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

644
00:26:58,976 --> 00:27:02,006 A:middle
It's not quite out worldwide
yet so stayed tuned very soon

645
00:27:02,006 --> 00:27:03,756 A:middle
because you're probably going
to want to play it after this.

646
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:06,336 A:middle
Now right now, I'm
in the process

647
00:27:06,336 --> 00:27:08,216 A:middle
of repairing my tiki hut.

648
00:27:08,216 --> 00:27:10,866 A:middle
As you can see, it's a little
pathetic at the moment.

649
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,306 A:middle
I want to add some more
timber but this is going

650
00:27:14,306 --> 00:27:17,106 A:middle
to cost me 8 diamonds.

651
00:27:18,046 --> 00:27:20,596 A:middle
Now, I only have 1.

652
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:24,816 A:middle
So what happens when I
press that green button?

653
00:27:25,376 --> 00:27:28,106 A:middle
I can get some gems right here.

654
00:27:28,206 --> 00:27:29,636 A:middle
I don't have to go anywhere.

655
00:27:30,336 --> 00:27:34,656 A:middle
I can stay right in that
moment of tiki hut repair.

656
00:27:35,686 --> 00:27:38,486 A:middle
So in addition to clearly
stating what I'm going to get,

657
00:27:38,926 --> 00:27:43,616 A:middle
200 gems for $4.99, they're also
reminding me why I'm seeing this

658
00:27:43,616 --> 00:27:44,466 A:middle
in the first place.

659
00:27:45,586 --> 00:27:46,736 A:middle
I need 7 more.

660
00:27:46,736 --> 00:27:47,446 A:middle
I only have 1.

661
00:27:47,446 --> 00:27:48,076 A:middle
I needed 8.

662
00:27:49,156 --> 00:27:50,706 A:middle
And they've even
selected the package

663
00:27:50,706 --> 00:27:53,036 A:middle
of gems that's closest
to what I needed.

664
00:27:54,076 --> 00:27:56,886 A:middle
It happens that this is the
smallest package of gems

665
00:27:56,936 --> 00:27:58,926 A:middle
but then I can make a
decision really quickly.

666
00:27:59,256 --> 00:28:02,066 A:middle
I mean, yes, they have
a gem store and yes,

667

668
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

669
00:27:59,256 --> 00:28:02,066 A:middle
I mean, yes, they have
a gem store and yes,

670
00:28:02,066 --> 00:28:03,986 A:middle
it has many more options in it.

671
00:28:04,876 --> 00:28:08,406 A:middle
But taking me away from my
tiki hut is more disruptive

672
00:28:08,406 --> 00:28:11,926 A:middle
than letting me just stay
put, stay focused on building

673
00:28:12,396 --> 00:28:14,406 A:middle
because building is
what I came here to do.

674
00:28:15,596 --> 00:28:17,716 A:middle
You never want to
distract a game player

675
00:28:17,716 --> 00:28:18,966 A:middle
from playing the game.

676
00:28:19,456 --> 00:28:20,476 A:middle
That's the fun part.

677
00:28:20,956 --> 00:28:23,116 A:middle
Distracting them makes
it easier for them

678
00:28:23,116 --> 00:28:24,486 A:middle
to just walk away entirely.

679
00:28:26,256 --> 00:28:30,406 A:middle
Similarly, Candy Crush Saga
handles this really well also.

680
00:28:31,446 --> 00:28:34,286 A:middle
You have those boosters at
the beginning of every level

681
00:28:35,126 --> 00:28:37,746 A:middle
and you have the option of
purchasing them right here.

682
00:28:38,396 --> 00:28:40,706 A:middle
They're not shipping
me off to a candy store

683
00:28:40,706 --> 00:28:42,736 A:middle
with a million different
things to choose from.

684
00:28:42,986 --> 00:28:44,936 A:middle
It's just, "Would you
like this booster?

685
00:28:44,936 --> 00:28:45,796 A:middle
Here's the price.

686
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:47,246 A:middle
Buy it. Back in the game."

687
00:28:47,586 --> 00:28:52,536 A:middle
Fast and efficient, right at
the moment when I can use it.

688
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,916 A:middle
Now another thing to think about
is preloading images and data

689
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:58,276 A:middle
so it's there when
people need it.

690
00:28:58,896 --> 00:29:00,416 A:middle
This is the Bejeweled Blitz.

691

692
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

693
00:28:58,896 --> 00:29:00,416 A:middle
This is the Bejeweled Blitz.

694
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:02,726 A:middle
It's another kind of
match-3 puzzle game.

695
00:29:03,346 --> 00:29:05,276 A:middle
Now you earn coins
as you're playing

696
00:29:05,336 --> 00:29:07,636 A:middle
and then you use the
coins to buy rare gems

697
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:10,746 A:middle
which then help you to do
better on the various puzzles.

698
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:13,976 A:middle
Now every day, you can
also get some free coins

699
00:29:14,426 --> 00:29:15,876 A:middle
from this daily wheel.

700
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:20,466 A:middle
Now you get 1 free spin
per day but of course,

701
00:29:20,466 --> 00:29:23,476 A:middle
you can buy some more
spins, if you like.

702
00:29:23,646 --> 00:29:25,706 A:middle
And the wheel's pretty generous.

703
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:27,626 A:middle
So imagine that you're excited

704
00:29:27,626 --> 00:29:29,006 A:middle
and you're like,
"Okay, you know what?

705
00:29:29,006 --> 00:29:31,016 A:middle
I'm doing really good on
the tournament this week.

706
00:29:31,016 --> 00:29:32,286 A:middle
I want to beat my friends.

707
00:29:32,836 --> 00:29:35,206 A:middle
Let me go get some more
spins and see what happens."

708
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:38,126 A:middle
Well, what if you're
faced with this?

709
00:29:39,116 --> 00:29:40,566 A:middle
People don't like waiting.

710
00:29:40,566 --> 00:29:42,516 A:middle
That's like that long
line at the coffee store.

711
00:29:43,206 --> 00:29:44,946 A:middle
You risk them not
sticking around.

712
00:29:46,336 --> 00:29:50,006 A:middle
Now thankfully, Bejeweled
Blitz doesn't do this.

713
00:29:50,276 --> 00:29:51,716 A:middle
They load everything
immediately.

714
00:29:53,106 --> 00:29:56,206 A:middle
What you want to do is to be
aware of what people are likely

715
00:29:56,206 --> 00:29:58,976 A:middle
to purchase based on where
they are in your app or game.

716
00:29:59,656 --> 00:30:02,776 A:middle
And then you can look for times
to thoughtfully preload it

717

718
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

719
00:29:59,656 --> 00:30:02,776 A:middle
And then you can look for times
to thoughtfully preload it

720
00:30:03,186 --> 00:30:06,076 A:middle
so that the data and the images
are available should someone

721
00:30:06,076 --> 00:30:07,036 A:middle
need it.

722
00:30:07,326 --> 00:30:09,516 A:middle
So this screen is
only accessible

723
00:30:09,966 --> 00:30:11,136 A:middle
from that wheel screen.

724
00:30:11,426 --> 00:30:14,326 A:middle
So this is a perfect opportunity
to preload those images

725
00:30:14,706 --> 00:30:15,796 A:middle
so then they'll be available.

726
00:30:15,796 --> 00:30:20,056 A:middle
The images and data will be
there when people seek it out.

727
00:30:20,266 --> 00:30:24,536 A:middle
And 1 final tip is you should
cache artwork appropriately

728
00:30:25,016 --> 00:30:27,286 A:middle
so it's not going to have
to load every single time

729
00:30:27,286 --> 00:30:28,886 A:middle
if it doesn't need to.

730
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:32,206 A:middle
Now after lunch in this
room, we have a great session

731
00:30:32,506 --> 00:30:35,466 A:middle
about optimizing in-app
purchases with StoreKit

732
00:30:35,676 --> 00:30:39,256 A:middle
so I highly recommend you come
back after lunch and check it

733
00:30:39,256 --> 00:30:41,356 A:middle
out because there's
a lot of great tips

734
00:30:41,396 --> 00:30:43,476 A:middle
for avoiding common pitfalls.

735
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:49,296 A:middle
Now finally, what you can do to
make the buying process easier

736
00:30:49,296 --> 00:30:51,446 A:middle
on people is to inspire people.

737
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:54,206 A:middle
Someone may not want something

738
00:30:54,206 --> 00:30:56,846 A:middle
because they don't know what
the possibility of it is.

739
00:30:57,136 --> 00:31:00,036 A:middle
They don't understand how a tool
or a feature could help them

740

741
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

742
00:30:57,136 --> 00:31:00,036 A:middle
They don't understand how a tool
or a feature could help them

743
00:31:01,116 --> 00:31:05,236 A:middle
or what they could
achieve with them.

744
00:31:05,456 --> 00:31:08,126 A:middle
Now, I'm not saying that
you want to turn everything

745
00:31:08,126 --> 00:31:09,736 A:middle
into an advertising experience.

746
00:31:09,736 --> 00:31:11,286 A:middle
Again, we're not
trying to be pushy.

747
00:31:11,606 --> 00:31:12,506 A:middle
But there's a lot of ways

748
00:31:12,506 --> 00:31:16,686 A:middle
that you can really naturally
illustrate how things can

749
00:31:16,686 --> 00:31:18,636 A:middle
be used.

750
00:31:19,196 --> 00:31:21,836 A:middle
Paper by Fifty Three
does this beautifully.

751
00:31:22,856 --> 00:31:25,606 A:middle
They've got this sample
journal that the staff has made

752
00:31:25,606 --> 00:31:28,506 A:middle
that shows off not only what
the tools are capable of

753
00:31:28,876 --> 00:31:30,986 A:middle
but also different ways
they could be used.

754
00:31:31,636 --> 00:31:34,616 A:middle
You know, maybe you
want a wireframe with it

755
00:31:34,616 --> 00:31:36,496 A:middle
or maybe you want to
make some artwork.

756
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:41,726 A:middle
Now another thing they do
well is give suggestive titles

757
00:31:41,726 --> 00:31:42,646 A:middle
to the blank journals.

758
00:31:43,706 --> 00:31:46,786 A:middle
Maybe you hadn't considered
sketching or journaling

759
00:31:46,786 --> 00:31:48,396 A:middle
with this app but
now you're going to.

760
00:31:48,396 --> 00:31:52,646 A:middle
And they also have a
gallery of artwork created

761
00:31:52,646 --> 00:31:55,176 A:middle
by people using the
app, regular people.

762
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:58,306 A:middle
And this gallery
shows off the variety

763
00:31:58,306 --> 00:32:02,146 A:middle
of styles that's achievable,
what you can do with the tools

764

765
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

766
00:31:58,306 --> 00:32:02,146 A:middle
of styles that's achievable,
what you can do with the tools

767
00:32:02,876 --> 00:32:05,336 A:middle
and also how the
app can be used.

768
00:32:05,336 --> 00:32:09,116 A:middle
I mean, you can make
some amazing artwork

769
00:32:09,116 --> 00:32:11,786 A:middle
but you also might want to use
it for architectural renderings.

770
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:16,686 A:middle
And if that doesn't get you
inspired, maybe the idea

771
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:19,516 A:middle
of having your work featured
here is very exciting.

772
00:32:20,206 --> 00:32:24,026 A:middle
So you've just got a plethora
of ways that you can use the app

773
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:26,616 A:middle
and see what the
tools are capable of.

774
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:32,516 A:middle
Now again, with games, and with
Supernauts does this very well,

775
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,846 A:middle
it's kind of a different
approach with the same idea.

776
00:32:36,796 --> 00:32:40,016 A:middle
So after you learn the basic
game play with Supernauts,

777
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:43,546 A:middle
they reward you for visiting
other people's worlds.

778
00:32:44,206 --> 00:32:46,456 A:middle
Now like I said, this is a
builder game so you're working

779
00:32:46,456 --> 00:32:48,526 A:middle
on building up your property.

780
00:32:49,336 --> 00:32:52,046 A:middle
And seeing how creative other
people have been is super

781
00:32:52,046 --> 00:32:53,996 A:middle
inspiring for your own place.

782
00:32:55,446 --> 00:32:57,756 A:middle
Now this is how you
start off, pretty basic.

783
00:32:57,836 --> 00:32:59,866 A:middle
In the first 15 minutes,
you're going

784
00:32:59,866 --> 00:33:01,796 A:middle
to get some real basic
structures going.

785

786
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

787
00:32:59,866 --> 00:33:01,796 A:middle
to get some real basic
structures going.

788
00:33:02,706 --> 00:33:04,886 A:middle
And after a couple of hours,
you might wind up with something

789
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:09,096 A:middle
like this or something
like my tiki hut.

790
00:33:09,096 --> 00:33:12,046 A:middle
And when you get through a
couple of hours, you think,

791
00:33:12,046 --> 00:33:13,206 A:middle
"Okay, I know what's going on.

792
00:33:13,776 --> 00:33:15,306 A:middle
I have an idea of
what's possible."

793
00:33:15,856 --> 00:33:17,696 A:middle
But it's only when you go

794
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:21,146 A:middle
to visit other people's worlds
do you really get a sense

795
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:24,276 A:middle
for what's coming, for
what can be created.

796
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:28,846 A:middle
So check these out.

797
00:33:28,846 --> 00:33:30,336 A:middle
These are all real players.

798
00:33:31,056 --> 00:33:34,686 A:middle
This is not the Supernauts
crew who created these.

799
00:33:35,756 --> 00:33:37,006 A:middle
Amazing, right?

800
00:33:37,236 --> 00:33:40,976 A:middle
I mean, my tiki hut is
super lame by comparison.

801
00:33:41,516 --> 00:33:44,566 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

802
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:46,936 A:middle
And now I'm excited.

803
00:33:46,936 --> 00:33:51,726 A:middle
Now I want to go in and add a
dragon or you know, a rainbow

804
00:33:51,726 --> 00:33:54,216 A:middle
or a flag or messages
to my friends.

805
00:33:54,256 --> 00:33:55,836 A:middle
I mean, it makes,
it gets you excited

806
00:33:55,836 --> 00:33:57,856 A:middle
about spending more
time building things.

807
00:33:58,206 --> 00:33:59,386 A:middle
You make something really cool

808
00:33:59,386 --> 00:34:02,106 A:middle
and you can see what materials
are still forthcoming.

809

810
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

811
00:33:59,386 --> 00:34:02,106 A:middle
and you can see what materials
are still forthcoming.

812
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:07,146 A:middle
So as you're thinking about how

813
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:09,646 A:middle
to make the buying
process easier,

814
00:34:10,795 --> 00:34:14,376 A:middle
make sure that people can see
what's available with no effort.

815
00:34:14,876 --> 00:34:18,686 A:middle
Help people understand the
value of what you're offering.

816
00:34:18,876 --> 00:34:20,735 A:middle
Give them that test
drive experience.

817
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:24,556 A:middle
And then when it comes
to the transaction,

818
00:34:24,556 --> 00:34:29,286 A:middle
make sure that you can process
on it fast and efficient.

819
00:34:29,286 --> 00:34:31,636 A:middle
And don't forget to
get people excited

820
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:32,696 A:middle
about what you're offering.

821
00:34:33,226 --> 00:34:36,065 A:middle
But the story doesn't end here.

822
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:37,886 A:middle
Your job is not over
just getting them

823
00:34:37,886 --> 00:34:39,076 A:middle
to push the buy button.

824
00:34:39,466 --> 00:34:41,266 A:middle
There's a lot of things
that need to happen

825
00:34:41,396 --> 00:34:44,716 A:middle
to complete the transaction
in order to have it continue

826
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:46,505 A:middle
to be a really great experience.

827
00:34:47,856 --> 00:34:51,916 A:middle
The first of which is a new
feature coming in the fall

828
00:34:51,996 --> 00:34:54,235 A:middle
and Tim touched on
this very briefly,

829
00:34:54,556 --> 00:34:57,045 A:middle
but I'd like to spend a little
more time because this is going

830
00:34:57,045 --> 00:35:01,126 A:middle
to impact everyone
and that's Ask to Buy.

831

832
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

833
00:34:57,045 --> 00:35:01,126 A:middle
to impact everyone
and that's Ask to Buy.

834
00:35:01,126 --> 00:35:05,186 A:middle
So in the fall, you'll be able
to associate up to 6 people

835
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,556 A:middle
in the household as a family.

836
00:35:07,176 --> 00:35:08,666 A:middle
And as part of this, we're going

837
00:35:08,666 --> 00:35:10,986 A:middle
to have a new parental
control called Ask to Buy.

838
00:35:11,826 --> 00:35:14,556 A:middle
And if it's enabled, this
means that a parent is going

839
00:35:14,556 --> 00:35:18,076 A:middle
to approve or decline any
purchases that a child makes.

840
00:35:19,036 --> 00:35:20,836 A:middle
So it's basically the
equivalent of this.

841
00:35:22,296 --> 00:35:23,046 A:middle
"Can I have it?

842
00:35:23,046 --> 00:35:24,166 A:middle
Please, please, please?"

843
00:35:24,946 --> 00:35:27,306 A:middle
But it's all going to
happen through your devices.

844
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:29,386 A:middle
So here's how it works.

845
00:35:30,106 --> 00:35:34,606 A:middle
Today, when your app sends a
request to purchase something,

846
00:35:35,756 --> 00:35:37,986 A:middle
you're going to get a
response right back.

847
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:40,456 A:middle
That purchased or failed.

848
00:35:40,456 --> 00:35:46,686 A:middle
Now with Ask to Buy, we're going
to check with the parent first

849
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,036 A:middle
if Ask to Buy is enabled.

850
00:35:48,036 --> 00:35:50,156 A:middle
So you're going to send
the request for purchasing.

851
00:35:50,616 --> 00:35:51,916 A:middle
The child's going to
ask for something.

852
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,336 A:middle
And then the App Store is
going to check with the parent.

853
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:56,356 A:middle
So what does that mean to you?

854
00:35:57,986 --> 00:35:59,926 A:middle
During this time, you're going

855
00:35:59,926 --> 00:36:01,966 A:middle
to get a response
back of deferred.

856

857
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

858
00:35:59,926 --> 00:36:01,966 A:middle
to get a response
back of deferred.

859
00:36:02,466 --> 00:36:08,216 A:middle
And then once the parent
accepts or declines the request,

860
00:36:09,246 --> 00:36:11,686 A:middle
that's when the App Store will
let you know whether it's been

861
00:36:11,686 --> 00:36:12,686 A:middle
purchased or failed.

862
00:36:13,976 --> 00:36:18,636 A:middle
And this deferred state can last
for up to 24 hours while waiting

863
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:19,916 A:middle
for a response from the parent.

864
00:36:20,206 --> 00:36:22,816 A:middle
And if there's no
response within 24 hours,

865
00:36:22,816 --> 00:36:25,886 A:middle
it's going to default to failed
and the child can request again.

866
00:36:27,156 --> 00:36:29,876 A:middle
So what does this mean
from a design perspective?

867
00:36:30,976 --> 00:36:34,046 A:middle
Well, if you have
modal situations

868
00:36:34,256 --> 00:36:37,206 A:middle
where people are doing
purchasing, you need to shift

869
00:36:37,206 --> 00:36:39,226 A:middle
over to an asynchronous model.

870
00:36:39,786 --> 00:36:43,566 A:middle
Let's say your game offers
boosters at the beginning

871
00:36:43,566 --> 00:36:46,156 A:middle
of a level and a child
makes a request to buy one.

872
00:36:46,716 --> 00:36:50,516 A:middle
You don't want that child stuck
there waiting for up to 24 hours

873
00:36:50,516 --> 00:36:52,616 A:middle
to hear whether they
can have a booster

874
00:36:52,616 --> 00:36:53,786 A:middle
for the next level, right?

875
00:36:54,116 --> 00:36:56,486 A:middle
I can guarantee you, they're not
going to stick around that long.

876
00:36:57,746 --> 00:36:59,206 A:middle
So what can you do?

877
00:36:59,206 --> 00:37:02,156 A:middle
Well, you have to figure
what's going to be best

878

879
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

880
00:36:59,206 --> 00:37:02,156 A:middle
Well, you have to figure
what's going to be best

881
00:37:02,156 --> 00:37:03,766 A:middle
for your app or your game.

882
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:07,036 A:middle
The important thing is that
you let people keep using

883
00:37:07,036 --> 00:37:08,926 A:middle
and enjoying your
app during this time.

884
00:37:09,636 --> 00:37:11,876 A:middle
So if a child's requested
a booster,

885
00:37:11,876 --> 00:37:14,746 A:middle
well you send the request
off for the parent to approve

886
00:37:15,146 --> 00:37:17,406 A:middle
but then you could let
them play other levels

887
00:37:17,446 --> 00:37:19,466 A:middle
or maybe they continue
playing the level

888
00:37:20,046 --> 00:37:22,746 A:middle
but without the booster and
when that approval comes in,

889
00:37:22,746 --> 00:37:25,536 A:middle
you bank it and let them
use it at a different time.

890
00:37:26,676 --> 00:37:29,746 A:middle
Another thing that you want to
think about is giving some sort

891
00:37:29,746 --> 00:37:32,116 A:middle
of feedback inside
of the application

892
00:37:32,466 --> 00:37:35,506 A:middle
so that the child remembers
that something is pending,

893
00:37:35,636 --> 00:37:37,466 A:middle
that they've already
asked Mom and Dad.

894
00:37:38,326 --> 00:37:41,846 A:middle
And so that you could update
the label on the button

895
00:37:41,846 --> 00:37:46,426 A:middle
to say something else or in the
App Store, we show a message

896
00:37:46,476 --> 00:37:48,926 A:middle
to help the child remember
that it's actually pending.

897
00:37:50,036 --> 00:37:53,266 A:middle
So if any people using
your app are under 18,

898
00:37:53,686 --> 00:37:55,956 A:middle
you need to start
preparing for this now.

899
00:37:56,926 --> 00:37:59,676 A:middle
That deferred state is
entirely new and you need

900
00:37:59,676 --> 00:38:01,416 A:middle
to make sure you're
handling it well.

901

902
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

903
00:37:59,676 --> 00:38:01,416 A:middle
to make sure you're
handling it well.

904
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:05,156 A:middle
Make sure people can still
continue to use your app

905
00:38:05,206 --> 00:38:07,906 A:middle
or your game while that
deferred state is happening.

906
00:38:08,446 --> 00:38:14,436 A:middle
And you want to make sure
that if a response is pending,

907
00:38:14,436 --> 00:38:15,906 A:middle
that they have some
feedback there.

908
00:38:17,366 --> 00:38:20,586 A:middle
It's really important to note
that this isn't just iOS 8.

909
00:38:20,586 --> 00:38:24,056 A:middle
So don't think that waiting to
update your app or game is going

910
00:38:24,056 --> 00:38:25,956 A:middle
to get you out of this
because it's not going to.

911
00:38:26,916 --> 00:38:30,646 A:middle
The ability to create families
is what's coming with iOS 8

912
00:38:31,426 --> 00:38:34,566 A:middle
but this Ask to Buy
permission is going to apply

913
00:38:34,716 --> 00:38:38,876 A:middle
to older versions of
iOS, Mac OS and Apple TV,

914
00:38:39,826 --> 00:38:42,836 A:middle
so start preparing now.

915
00:38:43,426 --> 00:38:45,366 A:middle
Now, whether or not a
transaction completes

916
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:49,386 A:middle
immediately or up to 24
hours later, you always want

917
00:38:49,456 --> 00:38:52,026 A:middle
to confirm that that
transaction is completed.

918
00:38:52,026 --> 00:38:52,626 A:middle
Let people know.

919
00:38:53,936 --> 00:38:57,736 A:middle
So at a minimum, help people
find whatever they just bought.

920
00:38:57,736 --> 00:38:59,916 A:middle
Let them know that
it's available for use.

921

922
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

923
00:39:00,896 --> 00:39:03,806 A:middle
An example that you guys
probably see all the time is the

924
00:39:03,806 --> 00:39:04,666 A:middle
App Store.

925
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:08,016 A:middle
So as soon as you confirm
payment for an application,

926
00:39:08,496 --> 00:39:10,566 A:middle
you see that the app
starts to download.

927
00:39:10,866 --> 00:39:12,816 A:middle
You get that feedback that
something's happening.

928
00:39:13,696 --> 00:39:14,756 A:middle
Nothing's gone wrong.

929
00:39:14,906 --> 00:39:17,096 A:middle
Your merchandise is
being transferred to you.

930
00:39:18,116 --> 00:39:21,606 A:middle
And then you can open that app
directly from the App Store.

931
00:39:21,606 --> 00:39:22,566 A:middle
You don't have to go digging

932
00:39:22,566 --> 00:39:25,176 A:middle
around all your home screens
filled with apps to find it.

933
00:39:25,476 --> 00:39:29,656 A:middle
You can just start playing
3's right there for hours.

934
00:39:30,586 --> 00:39:33,706 A:middle
Now, another thing to think
about is if you have a game

935
00:39:33,706 --> 00:39:36,066 A:middle
or a children's app,
something really fun,

936
00:39:36,216 --> 00:39:37,936 A:middle
you can make this
a fun experience

937
00:39:37,936 --> 00:39:39,856 A:middle
by using sound and animation.

938
00:39:40,766 --> 00:39:42,076 A:middle
So this is Heads Up!

939
00:39:42,476 --> 00:39:45,666 A:middle
It's a game that's really
popular with Ellen DeGeneres.

940
00:39:45,956 --> 00:39:48,286 A:middle
She plays it on her
TV show all the time.

941
00:39:48,706 --> 00:39:49,956 A:middle
It's a little bit like Charades.

942
00:39:49,956 --> 00:39:53,226 A:middle
It's designed to play it with
real people in real life.

943
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:57,576 A:middle
Each of this deck of theme cards
are topics that you then act

944
00:39:57,576 --> 00:39:58,976 A:middle
out for your friends
and try and guess.

945
00:39:59,186 --> 00:40:02,266 A:middle
Now they give you a
couple of theme packs

946

947
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

948
00:39:59,186 --> 00:40:02,266 A:middle
Now they give you a
couple of theme packs

949
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:03,886 A:middle
to get going to start playing.

950
00:40:04,566 --> 00:40:08,986 A:middle
But then they also offer
a ton of other theme packs

951
00:40:08,986 --> 00:40:10,386 A:middle
to enhance the experience.

952
00:40:10,886 --> 00:40:13,486 A:middle
So check out what happens
when you buy one of these.

953
00:40:13,736 --> 00:40:14,976 A:middle
I happen to be into
the 80's one.

954
00:40:22,181 --> 00:40:24,181 A:middle
[ Music ]

955
00:40:24,346 --> 00:40:26,786 A:middle
So you get that sound
and that animation

956
00:40:26,816 --> 00:40:28,576 A:middle
that lets you know
something has happened.

957
00:40:28,806 --> 00:40:31,476 A:middle
The purchase has gone through
and then they animate back

958
00:40:31,476 --> 00:40:34,416 A:middle
up to the top so you can
see where your cards are

959
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:39,146 A:middle
and start playing right away.

960
00:40:39,986 --> 00:40:45,306 A:middle
Now confirming that the
transaction is completed is

961
00:40:45,306 --> 00:40:47,156 A:middle
especially important
with Ask to Buy

962
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:50,846 A:middle
because your customer may
not be at the same place

963
00:40:50,846 --> 00:40:53,056 A:middle
where they were when they
requested the transaction,

964
00:40:53,056 --> 00:40:53,406 A:middle
right?

965
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:56,496 A:middle
So if you had a comic app

966
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:59,116 A:middle
and say the child is
browsing all the comics

967
00:40:59,116 --> 00:41:02,686 A:middle
that are available, they request
one and while they're waiting

968

969
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

970
00:40:59,116 --> 00:41:02,686 A:middle
that are available, they request
one and while they're waiting

971
00:41:02,686 --> 00:41:06,746 A:middle
for Mom or Dad to accept it,
well then they go and read one

972
00:41:06,746 --> 00:41:07,806 A:middle
of the issues they already have.

973
00:41:09,116 --> 00:41:12,426 A:middle
So you need to think about if
that transaction completes,

974
00:41:13,276 --> 00:41:15,866 A:middle
how are you going to let
people know if it completes

975
00:41:15,866 --> 00:41:17,706 A:middle
at a later time how you're
going to let people know

976
00:41:17,706 --> 00:41:23,566 A:middle
where their merchandise
is and how to find it.

977
00:41:23,836 --> 00:41:27,146 A:middle
Now no one wants to see
Error Code 128, right?

978
00:41:27,146 --> 00:41:29,676 A:middle
It's confusing.

979
00:41:29,676 --> 00:41:33,196 A:middle
It's frustrating to someone and
it can be a little alarming.

980
00:41:34,406 --> 00:41:37,216 A:middle
So you want to know your error
codes and present information

981
00:41:37,216 --> 00:41:38,696 A:middle
in a way that's going
to be meaningful

982
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:41,326 A:middle
to the people using your apps.

983
00:41:41,736 --> 00:41:43,836 A:middle
Not all errors may
require a response.

984
00:41:44,246 --> 00:41:46,056 A:middle
You don't have to tell
your people everything.

985
00:41:47,476 --> 00:41:50,256 A:middle
Now if someone did
cancel a transaction,

986
00:41:50,256 --> 00:41:51,896 A:middle
let's say that you're
using an app or game,

987
00:41:51,896 --> 00:41:53,116 A:middle
you change your mind
about something.

988
00:41:53,116 --> 00:41:53,836 A:middle
You cancel it.

989
00:41:54,506 --> 00:41:55,706 A:middle
Is this what you want to see?

990
00:41:56,356 --> 00:41:57,356 A:middle
This doesn't make sense.

991
00:41:57,996 --> 00:42:00,016 A:middle
You may not need to
notify people at all

992

993
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

994
00:41:57,996 --> 00:42:00,016 A:middle
You may not need to
notify people at all

995
00:42:00,696 --> 00:42:02,426 A:middle
or you may just want to
make this a little more

996
00:42:02,636 --> 00:42:03,426 A:middle
customer friendly.

997
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:07,816 A:middle
So the best experience,
of course,

998
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:09,726 A:middle
is to avoid errors entirely.

999
00:42:09,726 --> 00:42:11,616 A:middle
So again, this afternoon's
session

1000
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:15,216 A:middle
on optimizing StoreKit is going
to have a ton of technical tips

1001
00:42:15,676 --> 00:42:18,546 A:middle
about avoiding errors and
all those common pitfalls.

1002
00:42:19,046 --> 00:42:25,246 A:middle
Now another thing that I see
sometimes is that people tend

1003
00:42:25,246 --> 00:42:26,926 A:middle
to over ask for purchases.

1004
00:42:28,376 --> 00:42:30,486 A:middle
You want to let folks
get some enjoyment

1005
00:42:30,586 --> 00:42:33,006 A:middle
out of what they just bought
before you start asking them

1006
00:42:33,006 --> 00:42:33,916 A:middle
to buy something again.

1007
00:42:34,546 --> 00:42:36,456 A:middle
Again, don't be this guy.

1008
00:42:37,936 --> 00:42:41,276 A:middle
It's like at Christmas,
so you unwrap the toy

1009
00:42:41,276 --> 00:42:44,446 A:middle
and you're all excited
and then you realize, "Oh,

1010
00:42:44,446 --> 00:42:46,506 A:middle
it didn't come with
any batteries!"

1011
00:42:47,706 --> 00:42:49,186 A:middle
It's disappointing right?

1012
00:42:49,186 --> 00:42:50,656 A:middle
I mean, you just took something

1013
00:42:50,656 --> 00:42:53,426 A:middle
that was a really joyous
occasion and turned it

1014
00:42:53,426 --> 00:42:55,546 A:middle
into a frustrating
experience for people.

1015
00:42:56,186 --> 00:42:58,686 A:middle
So make sure that when
someone buys something,

1016
00:42:58,686 --> 00:43:00,366 A:middle
they can use what
they just bought.

1017

1018
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1019
00:42:58,686 --> 00:43:00,366 A:middle
they can use what
they just bought.

1020
00:43:00,906 --> 00:43:02,606 A:middle
Give them that satisfaction.

1021
00:43:02,706 --> 00:43:05,276 A:middle
They shouldn't have to
make a subsequent purchase

1022
00:43:05,326 --> 00:43:06,976 A:middle
in order to enjoy it.

1023
00:43:09,376 --> 00:43:13,096 A:middle
And then like I said
earlier, less is more.

1024
00:43:13,646 --> 00:43:16,056 A:middle
You want to prioritize
the remaining purchases.

1025
00:43:16,606 --> 00:43:20,076 A:middle
Help people focus on what's
still available to them.

1026
00:43:20,076 --> 00:43:22,956 A:middle
If there's things they
can't buy, do prioritize

1027
00:43:22,956 --> 00:43:26,086 A:middle
that in the UI, especially
with nonconsumables.

1028
00:43:26,206 --> 00:43:28,346 A:middle
There is no need to keep
showing people something

1029
00:43:28,346 --> 00:43:29,236 A:middle
that they've already bought.

1030
00:43:29,436 --> 00:43:31,726 A:middle
They already own it.

1031
00:43:32,136 --> 00:43:35,356 A:middle
Now in some cases, it may
not make sense to hide items

1032
00:43:35,356 --> 00:43:36,576 A:middle
that have already been purchased

1033
00:43:36,866 --> 00:43:42,636 A:middle
but just don't let them
be the star of the show.

1034
00:43:43,056 --> 00:43:45,956 A:middle
And I think you're all aware
that it's very important

1035
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,336 A:middle
that you let people
restore their purchases

1036
00:43:48,336 --> 00:43:50,406 A:middle
that they've made previously.

1037
00:43:50,606 --> 00:43:52,776 A:middle
They could have made
it on another device

1038
00:43:53,136 --> 00:43:57,036 A:middle
or they got a new piece of
hardware and it's important

1039
00:43:57,036 --> 00:43:58,616 A:middle
that they can retrieve what
they've already bought.

1040
00:43:59,596 --> 00:44:03,436 A:middle
This is "Brooklyn Magazine"
and they make it super easy.

1041

1042
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1043
00:43:59,596 --> 00:44:03,436 A:middle
This is "Brooklyn Magazine"
and they make it super easy.

1044
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:05,276 A:middle
If you already have
a subscription,

1045
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:08,276 A:middle
well here's where to go to
start that restore process.

1046
00:44:10,076 --> 00:44:11,456 A:middle
But they took it
one step further.

1047
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:15,636 A:middle
So if you were to tap on one
of these subscription options,

1048
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,376 A:middle
you get the confirmation
to subscribe just

1049
00:44:18,376 --> 00:44:19,306 A:middle
like you would expect.

1050
00:44:20,246 --> 00:44:24,916 A:middle
But if you hit Cancel, they ask
if you're already a subscriber.

1051
00:44:25,476 --> 00:44:29,156 A:middle
And that's because there's
basically 2 reasons why you

1052
00:44:29,156 --> 00:44:31,426 A:middle
might cancel subscription
confirmation.

1053
00:44:32,126 --> 00:44:35,846 A:middle
One is if you changed your mind
about subscribing, of course.

1054
00:44:36,126 --> 00:44:38,686 A:middle
And that's a much bigger
problem for them to tackle.

1055
00:44:39,546 --> 00:44:42,006 A:middle
But the other is if you
already had a subscription.

1056
00:44:42,396 --> 00:44:46,946 A:middle
So in this case, they're
helping get you back on track.

1057
00:44:47,266 --> 00:44:49,306 A:middle
Now you all know it's
an App Store requirement

1058
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:51,766 A:middle
to make restoring available.

1059
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:54,596 A:middle
But a great experience
is going to make it easy.

1060
00:44:54,596 --> 00:44:59,146 A:middle
All right, so one last
tip in this section.

1061
00:44:59,486 --> 00:45:01,516 A:middle
And this is about notifications.

1062

1063
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1064
00:44:59,486 --> 00:45:01,516 A:middle
And this is about notifications.

1065
00:45:02,206 --> 00:45:05,746 A:middle
You want to use them
thoughtfully and this applies

1066
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:09,086 A:middle
to push notifications as
well as local notifications.

1067
00:45:10,506 --> 00:45:13,036 A:middle
Now you're not going to have
to notify children about Ask

1068
00:45:13,226 --> 00:45:16,026 A:middle
to Buy, purchases completing
because the App Store is going

1069
00:45:16,026 --> 00:45:17,006 A:middle
to handle that for you.

1070
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:20,746 A:middle
But you do want to use
notifications to let people know

1071
00:45:20,746 --> 00:45:24,436 A:middle
about new content for
a subscription or maybe

1072
00:45:24,436 --> 00:45:26,376 A:middle
in those dating apps,
they could let me know

1073
00:45:26,376 --> 00:45:28,656 A:middle
if I have new recommended
matches.

1074
00:45:29,826 --> 00:45:33,196 A:middle
Circa does a great job
with their notifications.

1075
00:45:33,616 --> 00:45:36,336 A:middle
They serve up bite-sized
news articles

1076
00:45:36,336 --> 00:45:38,566 A:middle
and they give you
updates as it's happening.

1077
00:45:39,366 --> 00:45:42,436 A:middle
Now they're only going to send
notification if it's an article

1078
00:45:42,436 --> 00:45:45,446 A:middle
that I explicitly followed
or if it's something

1079
00:45:45,446 --> 00:45:46,986 A:middle
that they consider
breaking news.

1080
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:49,916 A:middle
And they're very choosy

1081
00:45:50,336 --> 00:45:52,076 A:middle
about what they consider
breaking news.

1082
00:45:52,506 --> 00:45:54,906 A:middle
Now this is not breaking news.

1083
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:56,486 A:middle
This is what I followed earlier.

1084
00:45:57,166 --> 00:46:00,006 A:middle
Swiping on that notification
takes you directly

1085

1086
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1087
00:45:57,166 --> 00:46:00,006 A:middle
Swiping on that notification
takes you directly

1088
00:46:00,006 --> 00:46:01,956 A:middle
to the article so you
can read all about it.

1089
00:46:02,306 --> 00:46:05,096 A:middle
So they've made it really easy
for me to return to the content.

1090
00:46:05,156 --> 00:46:10,186 A:middle
So you want to be really
thoughtful about the kind

1091
00:46:10,506 --> 00:46:13,126 A:middle
and the number of notifications
that you're sending

1092
00:46:13,506 --> 00:46:15,856 A:middle
because too many
notifications is just going

1093
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,106 A:middle
to annoy everybody.

1094
00:46:17,656 --> 00:46:20,406 A:middle
And not only do you risk them
turning off notifications

1095
00:46:20,406 --> 00:46:23,566 A:middle
entirely, they might just
wind up deleting your app,

1096
00:46:23,566 --> 00:46:25,456 A:middle
if they get tired of
all the notifications.

1097
00:46:26,426 --> 00:46:28,806 A:middle
That's not the experience
that we're after, right?

1098
00:46:28,936 --> 00:46:30,876 A:middle
You want thoughtful
notifications

1099
00:46:30,936 --> 00:46:32,896 A:middle
that will keep people
coming back

1100
00:46:33,716 --> 00:46:35,566 A:middle
and make the app
feel more valuable

1101
00:46:35,566 --> 00:46:40,236 A:middle
because suddenly there's
new content there.

1102
00:46:40,536 --> 00:46:43,116 A:middle
Okay, so make sure that
you consider these things

1103
00:46:43,986 --> 00:46:46,156 A:middle
after your customer's
pressed the buy button.

1104
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:48,766 A:middle
Completing the transaction
is super important.

1105
00:46:49,296 --> 00:46:53,266 A:middle
Which brings us to the
final sort of stage

1106
00:46:53,266 --> 00:46:55,296 A:middle
of a great experience
with in-app purchases

1107
00:46:55,296 --> 00:46:58,256 A:middle
and that's measuring
and refining.

1108
00:46:59,186 --> 00:47:02,046 A:middle
With all good design, it's
so important to iterate,

1109

1110
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1111
00:46:59,186 --> 00:47:02,046 A:middle
With all good design, it's
so important to iterate,

1112
00:47:02,476 --> 00:47:05,056 A:middle
you want to measure the
success and quite frankly,

1113
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:07,126 A:middle
the failures of what you tried.

1114
00:47:07,626 --> 00:47:09,676 A:middle
See how that has
an effect on things

1115
00:47:10,056 --> 00:47:12,546 A:middle
and then make changes
based on those.

1116
00:47:13,586 --> 00:47:16,276 A:middle
I mean, that all the things
that I mentioned today are going

1117
00:47:16,276 --> 00:47:19,096 A:middle
to work for all product
types and all audiences.

1118
00:47:19,816 --> 00:47:22,816 A:middle
So the more that you really fine
tune your approach, the better,

1119
00:47:23,256 --> 00:47:26,036 A:middle
the more effective
it's going to be.

1120
00:47:26,036 --> 00:47:28,756 A:middle
So here are some questions
that you can ask yourself

1121
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,706 A:middle
about the changes that you made

1122
00:47:30,706 --> 00:47:32,846 A:middle
to help determine whether
they were successful.

1123
00:47:33,756 --> 00:47:36,646 A:middle
So when were the changes
made and what were they?

1124
00:47:37,096 --> 00:47:40,246 A:middle
Super important, you want
to make a detailed note

1125
00:47:40,246 --> 00:47:43,196 A:middle
about exactly when you made
changes and all the things

1126
00:47:43,196 --> 00:47:44,616 A:middle
that you updated so
you have something

1127
00:47:44,616 --> 00:47:45,776 A:middle
to measure against later.

1128
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:50,856 A:middle
You also want to think about
how has the number of changes,

1129
00:47:51,096 --> 00:47:52,866 A:middle
how has the number
of purchases changed?

1130
00:47:54,006 --> 00:47:55,426 A:middle
Hopefully they've
gone up, right?

1131
00:47:57,426 --> 00:48:00,626 A:middle
And are different things being
purchased from different places

1132

1133
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1134
00:47:57,426 --> 00:48:00,626 A:middle
And are different things being
purchased from different places

1135
00:48:00,626 --> 00:48:03,646 A:middle
in the application as a result
of integrating your merchandise?

1136
00:48:04,116 --> 00:48:05,966 A:middle
Are you selling higher
value items?

1137
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:10,686 A:middle
And what's the average
revenue per device?

1138
00:48:10,766 --> 00:48:13,116 A:middle
And this is going to be
really easy to see in the fall

1139
00:48:13,116 --> 00:48:15,646 A:middle
with the new iTunes Connect
because we have a ton

1140
00:48:15,646 --> 00:48:18,786 A:middle
of app analytics coming
for you all for free.

1141
00:48:18,786 --> 00:48:20,896 A:middle
And this helps you learn whether

1142
00:48:20,896 --> 00:48:23,016 A:middle
or not a marketing
campaign was worth it.

1143
00:48:23,376 --> 00:48:26,466 A:middle
If you invested a certain
amount of money per device

1144
00:48:26,796 --> 00:48:29,426 A:middle
and you're not seeing that
revenue come back in, well,

1145
00:48:29,596 --> 00:48:32,976 A:middle
that campaign's not going to
be a good investment for you.

1146
00:48:33,666 --> 00:48:35,716 A:middle
And finally, keep an eye out.

1147
00:48:35,806 --> 00:48:38,126 A:middle
Are people returning
more frequently?

1148
00:48:38,876 --> 00:48:41,406 A:middle
Because if they are,
that's an indication

1149
00:48:41,406 --> 00:48:44,826 A:middle
that you have a really great
experience, that the quality

1150
00:48:44,826 --> 00:48:48,306 A:middle
of the experience has gone up.

1151
00:48:49,146 --> 00:48:53,216 A:middle
So I hope that you guys
will take at least one

1152
00:48:53,216 --> 00:48:56,676 A:middle
of the design tips that I gave
you today and implement it

1153
00:48:56,676 --> 00:49:00,606 A:middle
in your app or game and
then see how it affects the

1154

1155
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1156
00:48:56,676 --> 00:49:00,606 A:middle
in your app or game and
then see how it affects the

1157
00:49:00,606 --> 00:49:01,806 A:middle
overall experience.

1158
00:49:02,396 --> 00:49:03,106 A:middle
Because I think you're going

1159
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,076 A:middle
to be really happy
with the results.

1160
00:49:05,796 --> 00:49:08,726 A:middle
And I would like to
hear how it goes.

1161
00:49:08,806 --> 00:49:10,026 A:middle
This is my email address.

1162
00:49:11,176 --> 00:49:12,016 A:middle
So let me know.

1163
00:49:12,476 --> 00:49:13,616 A:middle
Let me know what you changed.

1164
00:49:13,616 --> 00:49:16,276 A:middle
Let me know the effects that
it's having on your sales.

1165
00:49:17,216 --> 00:49:20,026 A:middle
And if you would like more
design advice, we have tons

1166
00:49:20,026 --> 00:49:24,256 A:middle
of it at Designing Great Apps
up at developer.apple.com.

1167
00:49:24,946 --> 00:49:26,726 A:middle
And if you don't all have a copy

1168
00:49:26,726 --> 00:49:28,526 A:middle
of the Human Interface
Guidelines,

1169
00:49:28,726 --> 00:49:31,276 A:middle
it's a great resource,
a lot of good tips.

1170
00:49:31,666 --> 00:49:33,216 A:middle
It's available on
the iBooks Store now.

1171
00:49:34,236 --> 00:49:38,216 A:middle
So here are all the related
sessions you might want to see.

00:49:38,626 --> 00:49:41,076 A:middle
Ingredients of Great Games
was yesterday and that talks

1173
00:49:41,076 --> 00:49:44,316 A:middle
about how to have a really
great gaming experience.

1174
00:49:44,766 --> 00:49:47,556 A:middle
And so the video should
be available online

1175
00:49:47,556 --> 00:49:48,436 A:middle
and you can watch it.

1176
00:49:48,976 --> 00:49:51,646 A:middle
And just before the session
was the new iTunes Connect

1177
00:49:52,196 --> 00:49:54,626 A:middle
which had all the information
about app analytics.

1178
00:49:54,696 --> 00:49:57,806 A:middle
So look for that video
to be out later today.

1179
00:49:58,196 --> 00:50:02,086 A:middle
And then we have our Optimizing

1182
00:49:58,196 --> 00:50:02,086 A:middle
And then we have our Optimizing
In-App Purchases later today

1183
00:50:02,086 --> 00:50:04,876 A:middle
in this room, tons of
great technical tips.

1184
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:10,606 A:middle
And there's a prototyping
session tomorrow morning that's

1185
00:50:10,606 --> 00:50:13,426 A:middle
going to tell you all about
how to quickly iterate and test

1186
00:50:13,426 --> 00:50:16,756 A:middle
out the value and it's a great
session to figure out how

1187
00:50:16,756 --> 00:50:19,286 A:middle
to quickly test things
out that you might want

1188
00:50:19,286 --> 00:50:21,026 A:middle
to integrate into your app.

1189
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:24,396 A:middle

to Preventing Unauthorized

1191
00:50:27,686 --> 00:50:30,356 A:middle
because you're offering
really valuable things

1192
00:50:30,466 --> 00:50:32,136 A:middle
and we only want you
to be giving them

1193
00:50:32,136 --> 00:50:33,276 A:middle
to people who've paid for them.

1194
00:50:33,476 --> 00:50:37,866 A:middle
So it's going to be a very
detailed technical heavy session

1195
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,086 A:middle
that you'll want to check out.

1196
00:50:39,976 --> 00:50:41,426 A:middle
