Thank you for coming.

00:00:22,396 --> 00:00:24,846 A:middle
This is a session not
just creating app previews

10
00:00:24,846 --> 00:00:27,336 A:middle
but creating great app previews.

11
00:00:27,786 --> 00:00:28,926 A:middle
And I really believe that.

12
00:00:28,926 --> 00:00:31,416 A:middle
After this session, I believe
you're going to be able

13
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:32,636 A:middle
to create a great app preview.

14
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:34,376 A:middle
My name is Paul Turner and I'm

15
00:00:34,676 --> 00:00:37,436 A:middle
from the iTunes Engineering
Division.

16
00:00:37,796 --> 00:00:41,496 A:middle
And what that fancy title behind
you says, is that I have a job

17
00:00:41,636 --> 00:00:43,236 A:middle
that requires many talents.

18
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:45,356 A:middle
It's true.

19
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:50,856 A:middle
Not only do I run several teams
that keep content processing

20
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,286 A:middle
such as your apps, processing
and flowing to the store.

21
00:00:53,706 --> 00:00:56,646 A:middle
But in my 10 years at Apple,
I've been lucky enough

22
00:00:56,646 --> 00:00:59,836 A:middle
to be able to participate
in producing and engineering

23

27
00:01:02,316 --> 00:01:05,346 A:middle
One of my first projects was
with some of these people

28
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:05,976 A:middle
in the front here,

29
00:01:05,976 --> 00:01:08,966 A:middle
it was actually the
original App Store launch.

30
00:01:08,966 --> 00:01:13,766 A:middle
Since then, we've done
iBooks Store and HD films

31
00:01:13,766 --> 00:01:18,066 A:middle
and iTunes Extras and LPs and
iTunes Match and The Beatles.

32
00:01:18,356 --> 00:01:20,246 A:middle
It's been awesome.

33

This isn't about me.

34
00:01:21,606 --> 00:01:26,296 A:middle
What's actually relevant to
you guys though is that one

35
00:01:26,296 --> 00:01:29,066 A:middle
of the teams that I run is
actually the logistics team

36
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:30,496 A:middle
for apps made by Apple.

37
00:01:30,856 --> 00:01:34,746 A:middle
So, not only do I help engineer
and support iTunes Connect

38
00:01:34,746 --> 00:01:36,656 A:middle
but I am a customer of
it, just like you guys.

00:01:37,426 --> 00:01:37,726 A:middle
All right.

40
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:42,086 A:middle
So, let's talk about you and
your apps and your app previews.

41
00:01:42,956 --> 00:01:48,116 A:middle
First, I want to talk about
how content is previewed

42
00:01:48,116 --> 00:01:49,526 A:middle
to customers on the store.

43
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:55,376 A:middle
Currently, with our
amazing and innovative

I sit and click and
buy all day long.

50
00:02:01,926 --> 00:02:05,376 A:middle
And for my favorite
store, the film store,

51
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,196 A:middle
we have those great
theatrical trailers.

52
00:02:07,196 --> 00:02:09,606 A:middle
And for the TV store, we
have episode previews.

53
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:13,626 A:middle
And for everyone's
favorite, the iBooks Store,

54
00:02:13,756 --> 00:02:16,296 A:middle
we have those enticing
downloadable samples.

55
00:02:16,296 --> 00:02:18,066 A:middle
So, what do we have
for the App Store?

56
00:02:18,936 --> 00:02:22,756 A:middle
This week, we're
introducing app previews.

57
00:02:23,486 --> 00:02:24,376 A:middle
So, let's get to know them.

58
00:02:24,376 --> 00:02:24,906 A:middle

00:02:32,756 --> 00:02:34,606 A:middle
Let's pick it up where
Tim left us on Monday.

68
00:02:34,606 --> 00:02:37,116 A:middle
With that app that he
showed, Monument Valley.

69
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:41,206 A:middle
And let's take a look at the way
that it's previewed to customers

70
00:02:41,206 --> 00:02:45,676 A:middle
on the store right now.

71
00:02:45,676 --> 00:02:46,546 A:middle
It's pretty.

72
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:47,666 A:middle
All right.

73
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,106 A:middle
So, on the store, on the store's
product page, you're going

74
00:02:50,106 --> 00:02:50,956 A:middle
to have description text.

75
00:02:50,956 --> 00:02:52,316 A:middle
You're going to have other
information but, you know,

76
00:02:52,316 --> 00:02:53,686 A:middle
a picture is worth
a thousand words.

77
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:56,436 A:middle
Let's look at these screenshots
and they're beautiful.

78
00:02:56,646 --> 00:02:57,226 A:middle
They're beautiful.

79
00:02:57,226 --> 00:02:58,076 A:middle

83
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:03,746 A:middle
But I'm curious as a customer,
I don't fully understand it.

84
00:03:03,746 --> 00:03:05,596 A:middle
I don't understand
how the app functions.

85
00:03:06,516 --> 00:03:07,636 A:middle
This is app previews.

86
00:03:08,136 --> 00:03:11,506 A:middle
So, if a picture is
worth a thousand words,

87
00:03:11,736 --> 00:03:12,546 A:middle
what's a video worth?

88
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:14,976 A:middle
And this is it.

And you make an immediate
emotional connection.

And that's app previews.

94
00:03:55,956 --> 00:03:58,416 A:middle
So, I want to start off,
get us all on the same page

95
00:03:59,346 --> 00:04:00,856 A:middle
with just some basic
information.

with just some basic
information.

99
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:04,976 A:middle
App previews are up to
30 seconds in length.

100
00:04:05,336 --> 00:04:10,556 A:middle
App previews are not really
brand or campaign-focused.

101
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:13,266 A:middle
They are not full of cut scenes.

102
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:15,126 A:middle
They're definitely not
theatrical trailers.

103
00:04:15,126 --> 00:04:18,076 A:middle
They're just brief videos
meant to demonstrate the UI,

104
00:04:18,336 --> 00:04:21,086 A:middle
the features or the
functionality of your app.

105
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:25,806 A:middle
App previews are made
primarily of captured footage.

106
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:29,476 A:middle
And we're going to show you how
to do that live on stage today.

107
00:04:29,556 --> 00:04:33,586 A:middle
And once you're finished
producing your app preview,

108
00:04:33,626 --> 00:04:36,816 A:middle
you're going to export out
a high-resolution source

109
00:04:37,156 --> 00:04:38,266 A:middle
that you're going
to upload right

110
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:39,936 A:middle
into iTunes Connect very easy.

111
00:04:40,356 --> 00:04:42,336 A:middle
It's going to be reviewed
along with your binary.

112
00:04:42,376 --> 00:04:43,906 A:middle
We're going to re-encode
it for streaming

113
00:04:43,906 --> 00:04:46,126 A:middle
out to devices all
around the world.

114
00:04:46,606 --> 00:04:47,636 A:middle
It's incredible.

115
00:04:48,386 --> 00:04:50,916 A:middle
So, with that, let's talk
about the agenda today.

116
00:04:52,206 --> 00:04:54,346 A:middle
First off, we're going to
go over a little bit more

117
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:56,356 A:middle
of the details in app
previews, the characteristics,

118
00:04:56,356 --> 00:04:57,346 A:middle
what makes them different

119
00:04:57,346 --> 00:04:58,816 A:middle
than anything you've
really seen before.

120
00:04:58,816 --> 00:05:01,456 A:middle
We're going to help you
take that first step.

123
00:04:58,816 --> 00:05:01,456 A:middle
We're going to help you
take that first step.

124
00:05:01,456 --> 00:05:02,936 A:middle
And that's kind of the
most important step is,

125
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:06,506 A:middle
the planning step, how to
plan your video creatively

126
00:05:06,746 --> 00:05:07,536 A:middle
and technically.

127
00:05:07,946 --> 00:05:11,576 A:middle
We're going to show you
that capture feature

128
00:05:12,106 --> 00:05:13,396 A:middle
and it's amazing and I love it.

129
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,596 A:middle
We're also going to do
a little bit of editing.

130
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:18,116 A:middle
We're going to show your
editing options with iMovie.

131
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,966 A:middle
Next, we're going to show
you some composition tips.

132
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:25,046 A:middle
We're going to demonstrate
the uploading right

133
00:05:25,046 --> 00:05:26,016 A:middle
into iTunes Connect.

134
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:29,676 A:middle
And we'll round out everything
at the end with some guidelines.

135
00:05:29,866 --> 00:05:30,956 A:middle
Does that sound good
to everybody?

136
00:05:31,006 --> 00:05:34,786 A:middle
Yes, OK. It's OK to talk.

137
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:36,946 A:middle
It's interactive.

138
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:37,946 A:middle
All right.

139
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:41,196 A:middle
Let's talk about those details.

140
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:42,936 A:middle
All right.

141
00:05:42,936 --> 00:05:43,706 A:middle
App previews.

142
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:47,146 A:middle
App previews are a feature
of the iOS App Stores.

143
00:05:47,456 --> 00:05:49,426 A:middle
And as you saw on the
Monument Valley that Tim showed

144
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:52,366 A:middle
and we just showed here, app
previews are going to show

145
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:55,706 A:middle
up in the first slot
of the new section

146
00:05:55,926 --> 00:05:57,546 A:middle
for screenshots and videos.

147
00:05:57,546 --> 00:05:59,806 A:middle
So, that first slot will be
dedicated to app previews

148
00:05:59,806 --> 00:06:01,076 A:middle
and show up on the product page.

149

150
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

151
00:05:59,806 --> 00:06:01,076 A:middle
and show up on the product page.

152
00:06:01,396 --> 00:06:07,006 A:middle
App previews are
device specific,

153
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,596 A:middle
meaning that if you
have a universal app,

154
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:14,606 A:middle
you will upload a distinct
iPhone and a distinct iPad video

155
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:18,006 A:middle
for your app previews.

156
00:06:18,056 --> 00:06:19,576 A:middle
Also, we're making it very easy.

157
00:06:20,376 --> 00:06:22,766 A:middle
You're going to upload just
that single set of videos

158
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:25,856 A:middle
to your apps primary
localization and we're going

159
00:06:25,856 --> 00:06:28,436 A:middle
to disperse them to
the other storefronts

160
00:06:28,646 --> 00:06:29,926 A:middle
that your app is for sale on.

161
00:06:30,836 --> 00:06:37,236 A:middle
A couple more details, we need
those beautiful widescreens

162
00:06:37,236 --> 00:06:38,756 A:middle
to show off your app preview.

163
00:06:38,756 --> 00:06:41,526 A:middle
So, app previews are going
to be a feature of iOS 8

164
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,946 A:middle
and they're going to
display on those iPhone,

165
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:47,106 A:middle
those widescreen iPhones, the
iPod touches, the iPhone 5,

166
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,636 A:middle
the iPod touches, the iPads
and the Desktop Store.

167
00:06:50,186 --> 00:06:54,486 A:middle
One question I get a lot,
they're not required,

168
00:06:54,976 --> 00:06:56,596 A:middle
but they're strongly encouraged.

169
00:06:56,596 --> 00:06:58,086 A:middle
And I'm glad you guys
are all here today.

170
00:06:58,086 --> 00:06:58,936 A:middle
You've taken the first step.

171
00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:01,776 A:middle

launch app previews

00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:01,776 A:middle
We didn't want to
launch app previews

175
00:07:01,776 --> 00:07:03,856 A:middle
until we made everything
available

176
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,536 A:middle
and accessible to
every developer.

177
00:07:05,536 --> 00:07:06,706 A:middle
And now that we're doing that,

178
00:07:06,846 --> 00:07:09,096 A:middle
we're strongly encouraging
everyone to get on board.

179
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,226 A:middle
We really want you
to get on board.

180
00:07:10,526 --> 00:07:11,366 A:middle
We're here for the session.

181
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:12,266 A:middle
We're going to be in the lab.

182
00:07:12,706 --> 00:07:14,296 A:middle
We're here to help you get
on board with app previews.

183
00:07:14,296 --> 00:07:15,186 A:middle
We just think they're amazing.

184
00:07:15,656 --> 00:07:17,846 A:middle
This is my favorite.

185
00:07:17,846 --> 00:07:19,486 A:middle
This is my favorite
of all, my favorite.

186
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:23,466 A:middle
We have native aspect
ratio support built in.

187
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:30,866 A:middle
No longer will you have
to stretch or pinch or add

188
00:07:31,996 --> 00:07:35,216 A:middle
that to your videos to fit
in a widescreen player.

189
00:07:35,526 --> 00:07:37,616 A:middle
I want that off the screen as
bad, it's just burning my eyes.

190
00:07:38,116 --> 00:07:40,376 A:middle
We have native aspect
ratio support right in,

191
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:40,976 A:middle
built right in.

192
00:07:40,976 --> 00:07:45,576 A:middle
So, you get the full UI
video in the playback.

193
00:07:45,696 --> 00:07:46,706 A:middle
It's fantastic.

194
00:07:46,706 --> 00:07:51,426 A:middle
I want to talk about
planning next.

195
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:54,286 A:middle
I'm sure you guys
are sitting here.

196
00:07:54,286 --> 00:07:56,186 A:middle
I'm giving you a little
bit of information.

197
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:57,686 A:middle
Maybe the wheels are spinning.

198
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:58,686 A:middle
Maybe you think about your app.

199
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,446 A:middle
Maybe you're wondering
what you're going to do.

200

201
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

202
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,446 A:middle
Maybe you're wondering
what you're going to do.

203
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,486 A:middle
So, let's talk about planning.

204
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:03,486 A:middle
Planning is the biggest part
about making your app preview.

205
00:08:03,486 --> 00:08:04,596 A:middle
The rest of it we
made really easy.

206
00:08:04,596 --> 00:08:08,486 A:middle
So, planning is where you're
going to have to start.

207
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:11,116 A:middle
First, you're going
to have to figure

208
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,576 A:middle
out the goal of your
app preview.

209
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:17,376 A:middle
Are you going to highlight
a feature, many features,

210
00:08:17,886 --> 00:08:20,426 A:middle
maybe the utility of your app?

211
00:08:20,706 --> 00:08:22,256 A:middle
Maybe you have a
really innovative UI.

212
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:25,466 A:middle
Start thinking about
what your goal

213
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:27,486 A:middle
of your 30-second app
preview is going to be.

214
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:30,096 A:middle
And a great way to think

215
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:33,116 A:middle
about this is what
makes my app magical

216
00:08:33,226 --> 00:08:34,196 A:middle
or what makes my app magic?

217
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,926 A:middle
And an easy way to kind of put
yourself in that question is,

218
00:08:39,496 --> 00:08:42,096 A:middle
if somebody walked up to
you with your app, you know,

219
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:43,496 A:middle
"Hey, I've got this app."

220
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:44,436 A:middle
It's your app.

221
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:46,326 A:middle
What would you want them to
say to you about the app?

222
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,266 A:middle
You know, "Oh, I've
got this app.

223
00:08:48,626 --> 00:08:50,996 A:middle
It does this for phone basics."

224
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:52,926 A:middle
Or, "Oh, I've got
this really cool app.

225
00:08:52,926 --> 00:08:55,696 A:middle
It revolutionizes
the way I...that"

226
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,156 A:middle
or "What's your plan
over there?"

227
00:08:57,156 --> 00:08:59,176 A:middle
"Oh, this new cool
new game, it does this

228
00:08:59,176 --> 00:09:00,316 A:middle
and this character does that."

229

230
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

231
00:08:59,176 --> 00:09:00,316 A:middle
and this character does that."

232
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:02,076 A:middle
What makes your app magical?

233
00:09:02,586 --> 00:09:04,636 A:middle
You know, that's going to
make your magical app preview

234
00:09:04,636 --> 00:09:05,996 A:middle
and your app preview magical.

235
00:09:05,996 --> 00:09:09,726 A:middle
That's going to get people
to purchase your app.

236
00:09:10,246 --> 00:09:13,516 A:middle
Just like Monument Valley, you
saw those beautiful screenshots

237
00:09:13,516 --> 00:09:15,346 A:middle
and screenshots are
a very powerful tool.

238
00:09:15,726 --> 00:09:17,436 A:middle
But now, you have
this story to tell.

239
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:21,036 A:middle
You have this...you have app
previews to fill in that story.

240
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:23,106 A:middle
So, you're going to look
beyond your screenshots.

241
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:27,646 A:middle
How do you tell your story
now with these videos?

242
00:09:27,646 --> 00:09:28,476 A:middle
It's fantastic.

243
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:31,976 A:middle
A couple more things
on content planning.

244
00:09:32,296 --> 00:09:36,016 A:middle
So now, you started to figure
out what makes your app magical.

245
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:40,346 A:middle
You're starting to
understand what your goal is.

246
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:43,426 A:middle
Now, it's time to start
listing out these elements,

247
00:09:43,426 --> 00:09:45,026 A:middle
maybe list out the
elements that you want

248
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:46,246 A:middle
to put in your app preview.

249
00:09:46,246 --> 00:09:49,456 A:middle
If you're an app that's already
on the store, a great place

250
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,086 A:middle
to start would probably
be a description text,

251
00:09:51,086 --> 00:09:53,836 A:middle
that's probably your
first list today.

252
00:09:53,836 --> 00:09:55,346 A:middle
I bet every one of
you got bulleted list

253
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:57,476 A:middle
in your description text right
now, you can just steal that,

254
00:09:58,216 --> 00:09:59,106 A:middle
put that in your list.

255
00:09:59,436 --> 00:10:00,976 A:middle
But add to it, start
playing with things.

256

257
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

258
00:09:59,436 --> 00:10:00,976 A:middle
But add to it, start
playing with things.

259
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:04,376 A:middle
Start thinking about what
your app is all about.

260
00:10:04,376 --> 00:10:07,086 A:middle
Or, "Oh man, I spent so much
time on this great level.

261
00:10:07,086 --> 00:10:08,546 A:middle
I really want to show this off.

262
00:10:08,546 --> 00:10:09,396 A:middle
Kids love this."

263
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:11,666 A:middle
Or, "I get so much feedback
about this portion of my app,

264
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,526 A:middle
that's a great thing to
put in my app preview."

265
00:10:14,326 --> 00:10:17,746 A:middle
And I-- having said that,
now I highly encourage you

266
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:20,736 A:middle
to make some kind of
outline or storyboard.

267
00:10:20,736 --> 00:10:21,896 A:middle
And you see the storyboard
that we have

268
00:10:21,896 --> 00:10:22,936 A:middle
up on here-- on the screen.

269
00:10:22,936 --> 00:10:24,426 A:middle
This is for storyboard
but we're going

270
00:10:24,426 --> 00:10:25,786 A:middle
to actually show the app
preview this is based

271
00:10:25,786 --> 00:10:27,556 A:middle
on in a little bit.

272
00:10:27,846 --> 00:10:29,006 A:middle
But, it doesn't have
to be fancy.

273
00:10:29,006 --> 00:10:29,916 A:middle
You don't have to
be a greater drawer.

274
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,336 A:middle
This is a fantastic drawing.

275
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:32,776 A:middle
[Speaker laughs] It
could be on a napkin,

276
00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:34,626 A:middle
it could be on a
Chipotle napkin.

277
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:37,336 A:middle
You know, it doesn't matter
what you're drawing it on.

278
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,256 A:middle
It could be a series
of arrows and boxes

279
00:10:39,256 --> 00:10:40,776 A:middle
but start storyboarding it out.

280
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:42,676 A:middle
What do I want to
show in my video?

281
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:45,746 A:middle
How am I going to put the
story together, right?

282
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:49,406 A:middle
And along those lines,
you probably want to work

283
00:10:49,406 --> 00:10:52,046 A:middle
with that list of
elements, your storyboard

284
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:53,646 A:middle
and start working
with the timing.

285
00:10:53,646 --> 00:10:55,276 A:middle
Remember you have a
finite amount of time.

286
00:10:55,566 --> 00:10:57,526 A:middle
So say, "I like this element,

287
00:10:57,526 --> 00:10:58,856 A:middle
I really want to
show off this UI."

288
00:10:58,856 --> 00:11:00,566 A:middle
That takes about
5 seconds to load.

289

290
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

291
00:10:58,856 --> 00:11:00,566 A:middle
That takes about
5 seconds to load.

292
00:11:00,856 --> 00:11:02,666 A:middle
Let's start working
with the timing here.

293
00:11:03,116 --> 00:11:04,506 A:middle
This is the time in
the planning stage.

294
00:11:04,506 --> 00:11:06,506 A:middle
You don't want to get bogged
down in the production stage.

295
00:11:06,506 --> 00:11:08,786 A:middle
You don't want to be
working on your app preview

296
00:11:08,786 --> 00:11:11,356 A:middle
and still not know what you're
trying to accomplish by it.

297
00:11:11,956 --> 00:11:13,656 A:middle
So, part of the planning stage,

298
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,896 A:middle
and these are all basic
things I'm telling here,

299
00:11:15,896 --> 00:11:18,206 A:middle
but I think it's good to
remind everyone, it'll get you

300
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:21,586 A:middle
out of the weeds if you're
on the production process.

301
00:11:22,176 --> 00:11:25,336 A:middle
And one last thing on content
planning, just like screenshots,

302
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:28,136 A:middle
you have to disclose all
your In-App Purchases.

303
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:30,676 A:middle
So, that's a good time in
your planning stage to figure

304
00:11:30,676 --> 00:11:31,686 A:middle
out how you're going to do that.

305
00:11:32,036 --> 00:11:35,646 A:middle
If you're going to show the,
you know, the sword of thunder

306
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:39,406 A:middle
and that cost 10,000 coins,
you're either going to have

307
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:41,286 A:middle
to figure out how to
disclose that with some kind

308
00:11:41,286 --> 00:11:44,336 A:middle
of textural element or
maybe you want to show how

309
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:48,856 A:middle
that in-app purchase was
purchased in your app preview.

310
00:11:49,296 --> 00:11:50,146 A:middle
So remember, you have

311
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:53,356 A:middle
to disclose all your in-app
purchases, plan for it.

312
00:11:54,486 --> 00:11:55,176 A:middle
It's a good tip.

313
00:11:55,176 --> 00:11:55,666 A:middle
All right.

314
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,986 A:middle
A couple of technical
things to go over.

315
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:03,006 A:middle
If you're a universal app, you
might have a great storyboard,

316

317
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

318
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:03,006 A:middle
If you're a universal app, you
might have a great storyboard,

319
00:12:03,246 --> 00:12:04,296 A:middle
might have a great plan.

320
00:12:05,126 --> 00:12:08,206 A:middle
But your iPad app
and your iPad version

321
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:10,576 A:middle
and your iPhone version may
have different UI elements

322
00:12:10,576 --> 00:12:12,756 A:middle
that you want to highlight or
need to highlight or capture

323
00:12:12,756 --> 00:12:15,476 A:middle
in a different way to edit
into your app preview.

324
00:12:15,476 --> 00:12:17,896 A:middle
And the planning phase
is good to identify those

325
00:12:17,896 --> 00:12:20,286 A:middle
so you can capture them when
you need them to edit them

326
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:22,436 A:middle
into your production process.

327
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,886 A:middle
Next one. Oh, this
is a good one.

328
00:12:26,516 --> 00:12:30,496 A:middle
You know your customers
best, and so therefore,

329
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:32,356 A:middle
we're going to allow you
to pick your language

330
00:12:32,616 --> 00:12:33,376 A:middle
for your app preview.

331
00:12:33,376 --> 00:12:36,276 A:middle
And remember, it goes on to
your apps primary localization,

332
00:12:36,276 --> 00:12:37,516 A:middle
but you need to choose
a language.

333
00:12:37,516 --> 00:12:39,806 A:middle
Now, yet again, you know
your customers best.

334
00:12:40,456 --> 00:12:43,196 A:middle
If your app's primary
localization is Japanese

335
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:47,596 A:middle
and it's primarily sold
in Japan, but yet you know

336
00:12:47,596 --> 00:12:49,806 A:middle
that your customer is
expecting an English video,

337
00:12:49,806 --> 00:12:53,026 A:middle
as long as it passes guidelines,
we're going to allow it.

00:12:53,526 --> 00:12:55,006 A:middle
So, in the planning
phase, it's good to figure

339
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:56,376 A:middle
out what language
you're going to use.

340
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:59,886 A:middle
This is probably the most
obvious thing I'm going

341
00:12:59,886 --> 00:13:00,426 A:middle
to tell you today.

to tell you today.

345
00:13:00,426 --> 00:13:03,806 A:middle
The demo accounts, if you're
app opens up to a login screen,

346
00:13:03,806 --> 00:13:05,226 A:middle
it's going to be a
really boring app preview.

347
00:13:05,766 --> 00:13:07,086 A:middle
So, you're probably going

348
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,426 A:middle
to need some demo
accounts, you know.

349
00:13:08,806 --> 00:13:10,526 A:middle
And along those lines,
you may need

350
00:13:10,526 --> 00:13:14,296 A:middle
to stage some information
into those accounts.

351
00:13:14,296 --> 00:13:15,496 A:middle
If you're a social app,
you're going to need

352
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:16,366 A:middle
to put some social media.

353
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:17,626 A:middle
And if you're a calendar
app, you're going to need

354
00:13:17,626 --> 00:13:19,556 A:middle
to put some calendar
information in.

355
00:13:19,846 --> 00:13:22,986 A:middle
If you're a game and you really
want to show off that 4th level

356
00:13:22,986 --> 00:13:25,366 A:middle
that you, you know, kids really
love, you're going to have

357
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:27,416 A:middle
to figure out a way to
get to that 4th level.

358
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:31,216 A:middle
And I caution you, don't stage
anything in your app preview

359
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:33,146 A:middle
that cannot be accomplished
in your app.

360
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:35,656 A:middle
Your app preview has to
be represented of the app

361
00:13:35,656 --> 00:13:36,586 A:middle
that customer will buy.

362
00:13:36,956 --> 00:13:39,156 A:middle
It's just a caution, I know
none of you guys would do that,

363
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,746 A:middle
but I just want to
warn you about that.

364
00:13:41,216 --> 00:13:46,566 A:middle
Also in staging, it's a good
idea, just like screenshots,

365
00:13:46,636 --> 00:13:48,426 A:middle
we can't have any advertisements
in the app preview,

366
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:50,466 A:middle
so it's a good time
to stage those out.

367
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:52,266 A:middle
Sound good?

368
00:13:52,836 --> 00:13:53,346 A:middle

about this, the capture.

399
00:15:08,316 --> 00:15:11,256 A:middle
And you need a really
expensive cable for this

00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:13,186 A:middle
and really lots of...no,
I'm kidding,

401
00:15:13,186 --> 00:15:14,506 A:middle
you just need a Lightning cable.

A couple things about capture.

405
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:25,136 A:middle
In OS X Yosemite and iOS 8,
you're going to be able to hook

406
00:15:25,136 --> 00:15:28,166 A:middle
up your device via a Lightning
cable, right to your Mac,

407
00:15:28,286 --> 00:15:31,786 A:middle
open up QuickTime Player and
your device's screen output

408
00:15:31,786 --> 00:15:35,096 A:middle

All right.

418
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:52,146 A:middle
So, to do this obviously,
you're going to need iOS devices

419
00:15:52,146 --> 00:15:53,226 A:middle
that require Lightning cables.

420
00:15:53,226 --> 00:15:56,286 A:middle
So, that's your iPod
touches, your iPhone 5 series,

421
00:15:56,536 --> 00:15:59,576 A:middle
your iPads, you needed the
Lightning cable support,

422
00:15:59,576 --> 00:16:00,806 A:middle
it only works over Lightning.

No special modes, no clicking,
no shaking it over your head.

times and it works.

it in QuickTime,

A couple tips for capture.

433
00:16:20,776 --> 00:16:26,216 A:middle
We want to display the
highest quality video and audio

434
00:16:26,216 --> 00:16:29,656 A:middle
to the customers and so
we've made this capture tool

435
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,906 A:middle
so that you can capture
the highest quality video

436
00:16:31,906 --> 00:16:32,906 A:middle
and audio of your app.

437
00:16:33,296 --> 00:16:36,486 A:middle
You spend a lot of time
making...perfecting every pixel

438
00:16:36,486 --> 00:16:39,176 A:middle
in your UI and we want to
capture every single pixel

439
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:42,616 A:middle
and make sure that the
customer sees how much love and,

440
00:16:42,616 --> 00:16:44,196 A:middle
you know, everything that
you put into your app.

441
00:16:44,486 --> 00:16:46,466 A:middle
So, we're hoping that you're
going to use these Apple tools.

00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,716 A:middle
A tip just like Toca
Boca did there,

443
00:16:50,716 --> 00:16:54,176 A:middle
you can start your capture
or, you know, you can edit

444
00:16:54,176 --> 00:16:55,416 A:middle
in from your splash screen.

445
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,186 A:middle
It looks really kind
of cool if you want to.

446
00:16:57,636 --> 00:16:58,916 A:middle
But please don't
capture straight

from the home screen
going into your app

451
00:17:01,516 --> 00:17:05,165 A:middle
or if your app has inter-app
operability, don't switch back

452
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:06,796 A:middle

460
00:17:25,006 --> 00:17:27,306 A:middle
If your customer can't follow
along with what you're doing,

461
00:17:27,306 --> 00:17:29,326 A:middle
they're not going to
understand your app preview,

462
00:17:29,326 --> 00:17:30,336 A:middle
they're not going to
understand your app,

463
00:17:30,336 --> 00:17:32,776 A:middle
and they're probably going to be
discouraged by it, so go slow.

464
00:17:32,776 --> 00:17:38,796 A:middle
Use intentional moves, smooth
moves, smooth moves, you know?

to load into this camera.

drive so rehearse it, retake it.

you try and continue on, don't--

don't-- no, no, just stop,

is an example of what we

482

like to call a one take.

483
00:18:20,956 --> 00:18:22,406 A:middle
Instead of editing
clips together,

484
00:18:22,576 --> 00:18:27,136 A:middle
they've literally taken a one
take shot at their app preview.

485
00:18:27,646 --> 00:18:29,346 A:middle

added a couple graphics

and they go

through this nice smooth
intentional movements.

489

You have been developing your
app for days, weeks, months,

507
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:42,746 A:middle
years, you know a
lot about your app.

508
00:19:43,146 --> 00:19:45,786 A:middle
Well, the customer
probably doesn't have

509
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:47,226 A:middle
that same perspective.

510
00:19:47,556 --> 00:19:49,586 A:middle
So, when you're making
your app preview,

511
00:19:49,776 --> 00:19:50,866 A:middle
think about their perspective.

512
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:53,496 A:middle
If you're going to barrage them
with a bunch of information

513
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:55,676 A:middle
or assumptions about
what your app does,

514
00:19:55,886 --> 00:19:57,676 A:middle
they might be confused,
maybe put off.

515
00:19:57,676 --> 00:19:59,466 A:middle
So, think about your
customer's perspective.

516
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:02,156 A:middle
And, you know, this is a
great, great tip is, you know,

517

518
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

519
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:02,156 A:middle
And, you know, this is a
great, great tip is, you know,

520
00:20:02,156 --> 00:20:04,976 A:middle
use your friends, your family,
or everybody at your office.

521
00:20:05,506 --> 00:20:07,636 A:middle
Show your app preview
off and look

522
00:20:07,636 --> 00:20:10,196 A:middle
for what their feedback
is, you know.

523
00:20:10,546 --> 00:20:11,896 A:middle
See if there's something missing

524
00:20:11,896 --> 00:20:14,046 A:middle
to your story 'cause
you might have something

525
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:14,936 A:middle
in your head that, you know,

526
00:20:14,936 --> 00:20:16,276 A:middle
somebody else doesn't
have in their head.

527
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,276 A:middle
This is a common mistake; a
very, very common mistake.

528
00:20:20,276 --> 00:20:22,476 A:middle
If you're going to put
text up on the screen,

529
00:20:22,476 --> 00:20:26,366 A:middle
you need to put it up there long
enough for people to read it.

530
00:20:27,176 --> 00:20:28,566 A:middle
People do this all the time.

531
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:31,186 A:middle
They throw a text up on the
screen and they don't make it--

532
00:20:31,306 --> 00:20:32,976 A:middle
you know, they've-- it's
gone before you can read it.

533
00:20:33,136 --> 00:20:34,956 A:middle
So, make sure if you're
throwing text up there,

534
00:20:35,646 --> 00:20:37,086 A:middle
allow people to read your text.

535
00:20:37,576 --> 00:20:40,946 A:middle
This one is easy for me
'cause I'm always positive.

536
00:20:41,026 --> 00:20:41,996 A:middle
Stay positive.

537
00:20:42,436 --> 00:20:46,006 A:middle
There's no worst sales pitch
than a negative sales pitch.

538
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:49,376 A:middle
This is about your app and
why your app is the best

539
00:20:49,676 --> 00:20:51,236 A:middle
or why your app is awesome.

540
00:20:51,656 --> 00:20:54,516 A:middle
So, don't imply anything
about other applications.

541
00:20:54,516 --> 00:20:56,736 A:middle
Just keep it about your
app and stay positive.

542
00:20:56,836 --> 00:20:59,566 A:middle
This is real opportunity
for your app to shine.

545
00:21:00,056 --> 00:21:03,126 A:middle
A couple more tips.

546
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:06,026 A:middle
You may be a cross-platform
developer,

547
00:21:06,026 --> 00:21:08,726 A:middle
but for these 30 seconds,
you're all App Store.

548
00:21:09,256 --> 00:21:12,456 A:middle
So, go ahead and leave
off those platform logos.

549
00:21:12,736 --> 00:21:15,266 A:middle
In fact, leave off
the App Store logo,

550
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:16,606 A:middle
use the 30 seconds for you.

551
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,296 A:middle
We like our logo
just and-- it's fine.

552
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:20,936 A:middle
These are your 30 seconds.

553
00:21:21,706 --> 00:21:23,036 A:middle
Leave off the platform logos.

554
00:21:23,526 --> 00:21:26,616 A:middle
You might have this great idea.

555
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:33,286 A:middle
"New for Spring" in your app
preview, and then, you know,

556
00:21:33,286 --> 00:21:35,006 A:middle
you think you're going
to upload a new binary

557
00:21:35,006 --> 00:21:39,416 A:middle
or upload a new preview and your
cat gets sick or your car breaks

558
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,766 A:middle
down and it's eight months later

559
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:44,306 A:middle
and it's winter or
whatever season.

560
00:21:44,306 --> 00:21:46,306 A:middle
And now, it says,
"New for Spring,"

561
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,586 A:middle
and it makes absolutely
no sense.

562
00:21:49,596 --> 00:21:50,816 A:middle
So, keep it timeless.

563
00:21:50,816 --> 00:21:53,236 A:middle
Allow your app preview just to
be about your app in some kind

564
00:21:53,236 --> 00:21:55,126 A:middle
of neutral time space.

565
00:21:56,506 --> 00:21:57,966 A:middle
Straightforward transitions.

566
00:21:58,206 --> 00:22:03,066 A:middle
Now I love a star wipe
or barn doors or confetti

567

568
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

569
00:21:58,206 --> 00:22:03,066 A:middle
Now I love a star wipe
or barn doors or confetti

570
00:22:03,386 --> 00:22:04,676 A:middle
as much as the next guy.

571
00:22:05,146 --> 00:22:06,346 A:middle
Remember this is about your app,

572
00:22:07,056 --> 00:22:09,396 A:middle
so straightforward transitions
are really recommended

573
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:10,636 A:middle
when you're making
an app preview.

574
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:14,556 A:middle
Straightforward transitions
we actually have found just

575
00:22:14,556 --> 00:22:16,826 A:middle
in our tests can actually
sometimes be confusing though.

576
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,466 A:middle
Jump cuts is what we
recommend for everyone.

577
00:22:19,466 --> 00:22:21,936 A:middle
You've seen a lot of jump cuts
here and I'll show you a couple

578
00:22:21,936 --> 00:22:23,816 A:middle
of app previews that have
a lot of great jump cuts.

579
00:22:23,816 --> 00:22:27,106 A:middle
But in a couple situations, we
noticed that in jump cutting,

580
00:22:27,576 --> 00:22:29,596 A:middle
you can imply that
your app does something

581
00:22:29,596 --> 00:22:31,126 A:middle
that your app doesn't
actually do.

582
00:22:31,486 --> 00:22:33,306 A:middle
So, another great
straightforward transition is

583
00:22:33,306 --> 00:22:35,556 A:middle
like a dissolve or
a fade-through color

584
00:22:35,866 --> 00:22:40,686 A:middle
to give your user-- oh, OK,
this is a fade to another clip.

585
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,236 A:middle
Make sure you don't imply

586
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:44,126 A:middle
that your app does
something that it does not.

587
00:22:44,126 --> 00:22:45,496 A:middle
You don't want to
confuse your customers,

588
00:22:45,496 --> 00:22:46,426 A:middle
we love our customers.

589
00:22:47,156 --> 00:22:49,846 A:middle
My last point is,
remember the tone.

590
00:22:50,276 --> 00:22:53,176 A:middle
These aren't in your
face marketing videos.

591
00:22:53,176 --> 00:22:58,516 A:middle
This is just simple short app
usage videos, they're fantastic.

592
00:22:58,516 --> 00:22:59,386 A:middle
Remember the tone.

593

594
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

595
00:23:00,696 --> 00:23:01,026 A:middle
All right.

596
00:23:01,436 --> 00:23:03,616 A:middle
This is my things
to avoid slide,

597
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,696 A:middle
I'll put my deep serious
voice on for this.

598
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:06,796 A:middle
All right.

599
00:23:06,796 --> 00:23:07,376 A:middle
Things to avoid.

600
00:23:07,606 --> 00:23:08,696 A:middle
It's not that serious,
don't worry.

601
00:23:10,676 --> 00:23:14,726 A:middle
Blinking, crazy, flashing,
loud, obnoxious things,

602
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:17,236 A:middle
this isn't the '90s and
these aren't banner ads.

603
00:23:19,326 --> 00:23:21,316 A:middle
If they're watching
your app preview,

604
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,916 A:middle
they're already on
your product page.

605
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,096 A:middle
They've already clicked Play,

606
00:23:24,096 --> 00:23:26,176 A:middle
you don't need a
gimmick to draw them in.

607
00:23:26,176 --> 00:23:27,996 A:middle
Please keep it simple.

608
00:23:28,446 --> 00:23:29,516 A:middle
You don't have to do this.

609
00:23:30,706 --> 00:23:34,136 A:middle
Pricing, if you're going to
put pricing in your video,

610
00:23:34,136 --> 00:23:34,906 A:middle
it's going to get lost,

611
00:23:34,906 --> 00:23:37,516 A:middle
it's going to put
you into the corner.

612
00:23:37,686 --> 00:23:39,766 A:middle
Remember, your app preview

613
00:23:39,766 --> 00:23:41,446 A:middle
or your app is sold
internationally.

614
00:23:41,816 --> 00:23:43,566 A:middle
You may put your
app on sale one day.

615
00:23:43,566 --> 00:23:45,576 A:middle
If you block yourself in
the pricing in your video,

616
00:23:45,576 --> 00:23:46,866 A:middle
it's not going to
make any sense.

617
00:23:46,866 --> 00:23:47,816 A:middle
Leave the pricing out.

618
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,586 A:middle
These are going to display
in your product page.

619
00:23:49,586 --> 00:23:51,296 A:middle
The product page
already has pricing.

620
00:23:51,466 --> 00:23:53,306 A:middle
It already has storefront-based
pricing.

621
00:23:53,826 --> 00:23:59,846 A:middle
Leave the pricing
for the product page.

622
00:23:59,846 --> 00:24:04,176 A:middle
Local-- yeah, you know,
local colloquialisms, memes,

623

624
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

625
00:23:59,846 --> 00:24:04,176 A:middle
Local-- yeah, you know,
local colloquialisms, memes,

626
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:06,986 A:middle
things like that,
references to Game of Thrones

627
00:24:06,986 --> 00:24:08,916 A:middle
that I don't even understand
because I don't watch the show.

628
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:11,586 A:middle
I'm probably the
only one who doesn't.

629
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:13,316 A:middle
But this is about
your app preview.

630
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:17,456 A:middle
It's not about anything that's
going on in the media nowadays.

631
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,526 A:middle
So, just keep it about
your app, keep it simple.

632
00:24:20,196 --> 00:24:21,486 A:middle
And here's the big one.

633
00:24:21,546 --> 00:24:24,496 A:middle
You can't put anything-- this
is just like screenshots,

634
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,666 A:middle
it's just like your app,
you can't put anything

635
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,976 A:middle
in your app preview that you
don't have the rights to use.

636
00:24:28,976 --> 00:24:32,406 A:middle
And this includes, but
isn't limited to, imagery

637
00:24:32,406 --> 00:24:36,466 A:middle
or photography or text or
sounds or music or videos.

638
00:24:36,756 --> 00:24:40,686 A:middle
If you don't have the rights
to use it, do not put it

639
00:24:40,686 --> 00:24:42,446 A:middle
in your app preview, all right.

640
00:24:42,446 --> 00:24:45,186 A:middle
That was as serious
as it's going to get.

641
00:24:45,386 --> 00:24:47,256 A:middle
One thing we added in
here 'cause we got a lot

642
00:24:47,256 --> 00:24:49,096 A:middle
of questions on it,
is narration.

643
00:24:50,296 --> 00:24:53,596 A:middle
Absolutely, it's a powerful
tool if used correctly.

644
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:55,776 A:middle
So, here's a couple of tips.

645
00:24:56,736 --> 00:25:00,476 A:middle
There is an incredible
voiceover community out there.

646

647
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

648
00:24:56,736 --> 00:25:00,476 A:middle
There is an incredible
voiceover community out there.

649
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:02,926 A:middle
Look for them, they're
so talented.

650
00:25:03,216 --> 00:25:04,556 A:middle
Use professional voices.

651
00:25:04,856 --> 00:25:08,806 A:middle
Not everyone has the intonation
and clarity for voice over work.

652
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,026 A:middle
Obviously, I don't either, um.

653
00:25:12,926 --> 00:25:15,006 A:middle
But remember, this
is a voice now.

654
00:25:15,006 --> 00:25:16,296 A:middle
This is the voice of your app.

655
00:25:16,296 --> 00:25:17,596 A:middle
So, choose your voice wisely.

656
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:21,006 A:middle
The second one is use
professional equipment.

657
00:25:21,646 --> 00:25:22,876 A:middle
It's available everywhere.

658
00:25:22,876 --> 00:25:26,296 A:middle
Condenser mics, pop filters,
just recording studios

659
00:25:26,296 --> 00:25:27,606 A:middle
in general, quiet rooms.

660
00:25:27,886 --> 00:25:31,326 A:middle
Nobody wants to listen to an app
preview with a narration on it

661
00:25:31,326 --> 00:25:33,276 A:middle
and they can hear your dog
barking at the background.

662
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:36,986 A:middle
Or maybe for some of our younger
developers, you know, "Jenny,

663
00:25:36,986 --> 00:25:39,756 A:middle
come down to dinner," you know.

664
00:25:41,536 --> 00:25:47,556 A:middle
No, no. And lastly,
narration is a powerful tool,

665
00:25:47,556 --> 00:25:49,076 A:middle
but sometimes, it
can be overused.

666
00:25:49,076 --> 00:25:51,396 A:middle
You don't want to narrate your
entire video, but you want

667
00:25:51,396 --> 00:25:52,466 A:middle
to let your app speak.

668
00:25:52,466 --> 00:25:55,646 A:middle
So, just use narration wisely
is what I'm going to say.

669
00:25:56,836 --> 00:25:57,906 A:middle
And having said that, I want

670
00:25:57,906 --> 00:26:00,236 A:middle
to show you a really
cool app preview.

1186
00:45:58,716 --> 00:46:02,536 A:middle
Next one, just like screenshots,
you got to keep it 4+.

1187
00:46:02,966 --> 00:46:04,916 A:middle
And I know you're sitting
there maybe have a game called

1188
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:06,206 A:middle
Mortal Kombat.

1189
00:46:06,716 --> 00:46:08,076 A:middle
And that you're like,
"Paul, do I have to make it

1190
00:46:08,076 --> 00:46:09,716 A:middle
into a tickle fest or
something like that?"

1191
00:46:09,716 --> 00:46:12,036 A:middle
No. But you're going to have
to get creative, you know,

1192
00:46:12,036 --> 00:46:14,106 A:middle
what did Spielberg do when
the shark didn't work?

1193
00:46:14,106 --> 00:46:15,356 A:middle
He made "Jaws" and
it was awesome.

1194
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:18,666 A:middle
So, get creative, creative
editing, just, you know,

1195
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:20,276 A:middle
leave the violence,
those things out.

1196
00:46:20,276 --> 00:46:22,836 A:middle
It has to be 4+ applicable
to all audiences just

1197
00:46:22,836 --> 00:46:25,426 A:middle
like screenshots, easy enough.

1198
00:46:26,196 --> 00:46:26,786 A:middle
All right.

1199
00:46:27,276 --> 00:46:28,566 A:middle
Use captured footage.

1200
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:34,336 A:middle
No people in-- you know,
videos of people interacting

1201
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:36,696 A:middle
with your apps, no
hands in the shots,

1202
00:46:36,696 --> 00:46:38,556 A:middle
so let's remove that hand.

1203
00:46:38,816 --> 00:46:39,886 A:middle
This is captured footage.

1204
00:46:39,886 --> 00:46:41,686 A:middle
You can use some
textual elements.

1205
00:46:41,936 --> 00:46:44,916 A:middle
You can use graphic elements
that highlight points.

1206
00:46:45,006 --> 00:46:47,716 A:middle
But, this is mostly about your
app and your app preview needs

1207
00:46:47,716 --> 00:46:49,886 A:middle
to be made mostly
of captured footage.

1208
00:46:49,886 --> 00:46:51,206 A:middle
And we've given you those tools.

1209
00:46:51,206 --> 00:46:52,886 A:middle
So, use captured footage.

1217
00:47:04,416 --> 00:47:06,906 A:middle
of their likeness
in your app preview.

You know about Johnny Appleseed,
we use it all the time.

1219
00:47:10,196 --> 00:47:12,956 A:middle
You need to find your own Johnny
Appleseeds and if you're going

1220
00:47:12,956 --> 00:47:14,846 A:middle
to use any data in
your app preview.

1221

This last one, I've gone over it
before, I'll go over it again.

You got to identify your
in-app purchases, you know,

the sword of truth, the missiles
in our Touch Fighter app here.

1224
00:47:26,666 --> 00:47:28,796 A:middle
You got to figure out a
way in your app preview--

1225
00:47:28,796 --> 00:47:31,116 A:middle
if you're going to use those
in-app purchase content,

1226
00:47:31,296 --> 00:47:32,806 A:middle
you got to figure out
a way to disclose them

1227
00:47:32,806 --> 00:47:35,136 A:middle
in your in-app purchases,
simple as that.

1228

Just a couple guidelines to
keep in your head, very easy.

very easy for you guys.

1230
00:47:40,796 --> 00:47:41,116 A:middle
All right.

1231
00:47:41,116 --> 00:47:43,116 A:middle
Time for a summary.

1232
00:47:44,356 --> 00:47:48,726 A:middle
App previews are just 30
seconds of app usage footage.

1233
00:47:48,726 --> 00:47:53,756 A:middle
They need to be 4+ and
appropriate for all audiences.

ratios and device dimensions.

of personal to me.

1251
00:48:34,596 --> 00:48:37,876 A:middle
This one came in and I believe
this app also won a design award

1252
00:48:38,026 --> 00:48:39,076 A:middle
this week which is kind of neat.

1253
00:48:39,736 --> 00:48:42,926 A:middle
This app preview came in
and it just touched me.

I was one of those people

1255

that would kind of sit
and look out of the stars.

1256
00:48:48,366 --> 00:48:49,786 A:middle
And everybody does this, right?

1257
00:48:49,786 --> 00:48:53,596 A:middle
You've put your finger out, you
kind of trace the Big Dipper

1258
00:48:53,596 --> 00:48:56,946 A:middle
or you track Orion or
something like that.

dreamed I could I do.

I immediately-- yet again,
immediately run to my iPad,

1265

bought the app, went home,

sat out on the porch
with my daughter.
