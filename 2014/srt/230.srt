1
00:00:11,246 --> 00:00:12,226 A:middle
>> Good afternoon.

2
00:00:12,726 --> 00:00:15,186 A:middle
I'm John Cavanaugh,
and I manage the group

3
00:00:15,186 --> 00:00:17,576 A:middle
that creates the
documentation for all

4
00:00:17,576 --> 00:00:19,606 A:middle
of Apple's consumer
and Pro products.

5
00:00:20,156 --> 00:00:21,296 A:middle
And here's some of what we do.

6
00:00:22,536 --> 00:00:29,236 A:middle
Print pieces that come in
the box, iBooks and PDFs,

7
00:00:29,406 --> 00:00:32,706 A:middle
help topics that appear
in the OS X Help Viewer.

8
00:00:33,436 --> 00:00:36,816 A:middle
We have some highly
contextual In-App solutions

9
00:00:37,726 --> 00:00:41,416 A:middle
and deliverables on the web
like these iOS user guides

10
00:00:42,536 --> 00:00:45,346 A:middle
or this What's New
Experience you may have seen

11
00:00:45,586 --> 00:00:47,966 A:middle
in OS X Mavericks.

12
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:53,476 A:middle
Now, creating great customer
documentation isn't always seen

13
00:00:53,476 --> 00:00:56,986 A:middle
as one of the most exciting
parts of software development -

14
00:00:57,246 --> 00:00:59,616 A:middle
I realize that as the
documentation guy.

15

16
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

17
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:04,286 A:middle
And it can often be treated as
an afterthought by developers.

18
00:01:04,866 --> 00:01:06,756 A:middle
Not the developers in
this room of course,

19
00:01:06,756 --> 00:01:08,436 A:middle
but let's just say
some developers.

20
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:14,676 A:middle
And when that's the case, it can
often take the form of an FAQ

21
00:01:14,676 --> 00:01:18,316 A:middle
or help system where
basically you wait

22
00:01:18,316 --> 00:01:22,866 A:middle
until a person gets stuck, drop
them into a comprehensive body

23
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:25,946 A:middle
of content and then have
them fend for themselves

24
00:01:25,946 --> 00:01:27,206 A:middle
to try to get answers.

25
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:32,326 A:middle
And historically, icons
like this have been used

26
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:34,136 A:middle
to represent the experience,

27
00:01:34,476 --> 00:01:37,726 A:middle
which really isn't the
most flattering image

28
00:01:37,726 --> 00:01:44,096 A:middle
to have associated with your app
or game, unless of course it's

29
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:49,866 A:middle
about rescuing people
lost at sea, I don't know.

30
00:01:50,106 --> 00:01:54,206 A:middle
Now, this Get answers
strategy, it does have its place

31
00:01:54,536 --> 00:01:59,136 A:middle
in help systems for deeper
apps, but as iOS developers,

32
00:01:59,136 --> 00:02:01,286 A:middle
you probably don't
even have to go here.

33

34
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

35
00:01:59,136 --> 00:02:01,286 A:middle
you probably don't
even have to go here.

36
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:06,476 A:middle
Instead, Rachel is
going to show you how

37
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:10,735 A:middle
to anticipate users' needs in a
seamless onboarding experience

38
00:02:10,906 --> 00:02:13,006 A:middle
so they won't even feel like
they're getting your help.

39
00:02:13,596 --> 00:02:16,066 A:middle
They'll just feel as though
they're experiencing your

40
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:17,356 A:middle
amazing app or game.

41
00:02:18,696 --> 00:02:22,136 A:middle
She's also going to show you
how to extend the strategy

42
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:25,346 A:middle
into an area we like to
call Inform & Inspire,

43
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:30,326 A:middle
and that gives you the
opportunity to delight users

44
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:32,676 A:middle
by showing them what's possible.

45
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:38,066 A:middle
Now as I've said, there's
great ways to do this and not

46
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:41,146 A:middle
so great ways, and that's what
Rachel is going to show you now.

47
00:02:41,956 --> 00:02:42,306 A:middle
Rachel.

48
00:02:43,516 --> 00:02:45,536 A:middle
[ Applause ]

49
00:02:46,036 --> 00:02:46,536 A:middle
>> Thanks, John.

50
00:02:47,516 --> 00:02:48,156 A:middle
Hi, everyone.

51
00:02:48,856 --> 00:02:50,946 A:middle
My name is Rachel
Roth and I'm one

52
00:02:50,946 --> 00:02:53,596 A:middle
of Apple's user experience
evangelists.

53
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:56,566 A:middle
So today, we're going to talk

54
00:02:56,566 --> 00:02:59,516 A:middle
about onboarding and
welcoming people.

55

56
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

57
00:03:00,286 --> 00:03:01,946 A:middle
Now, this term onboarding,

58
00:03:01,946 --> 00:03:05,336 A:middle
you may have heard it called
the new user experience

59
00:03:05,336 --> 00:03:09,856 A:middle
or the first use
experience or what happens

60
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,306 A:middle
in a tutorial for a game.

61
00:03:12,136 --> 00:03:15,336 A:middle
And really, onboarding is a term
that's traditionally associated

62
00:03:15,336 --> 00:03:17,476 A:middle
with what happens with employees

63
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:18,886 A:middle
when they first started
a company.

64
00:03:19,446 --> 00:03:22,306 A:middle
It's how people acquire the
knowledge and the skills

65
00:03:22,576 --> 00:03:25,436 A:middle
and behaviors to become
successful at their job.

66
00:03:26,516 --> 00:03:29,946 A:middle
Now, when it comes to an app or
a game, people are going to go

67
00:03:29,946 --> 00:03:32,026 A:middle
through a similar
sort of experience.

68
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:34,966 A:middle
They need to figure out, you
know, how does the UI work,

69
00:03:35,456 --> 00:03:38,296 A:middle
how's the game played,
is this app really going

70
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:39,186 A:middle
to be right for me?

71
00:03:39,816 --> 00:03:43,186 A:middle
And that's why you
want to welcome them.

72
00:03:43,186 --> 00:03:46,816 A:middle
It's so important that their
first experience is a good one

73
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,976 A:middle
because otherwise it's going
to be their last experience,

74
00:03:50,946 --> 00:03:52,866 A:middle
because we've got a
million other competitors

75
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,086 A:middle
in the App Store, literally.

76
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:55,766 A:middle
So people aren't going to stick

77
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:58,756 A:middle
around if the first
experience isn't really great.

78
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:05,106 A:middle
Now, when you step into a store,
there's - like a physical store

79

80
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

81
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:05,106 A:middle
Now, when you step into a store,
there's - like a physical store

82
00:04:05,106 --> 00:04:07,456 A:middle
in real life, there's a number
of things that are going

83
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,676 A:middle
to influence whether
or not you stick around

84
00:04:10,096 --> 00:04:11,606 A:middle
or whether you turn
around and walk out.

85
00:04:12,726 --> 00:04:13,876 A:middle
You know, is the layout

86
00:04:13,876 --> 00:04:16,676 A:middle
of the store intimidating
or is it inviting?

87
00:04:16,676 --> 00:04:18,986 A:middle
You know, is the staff rude?

88
00:04:19,646 --> 00:04:21,926 A:middle
Is the staff really
aggressively pushy?

89
00:04:22,816 --> 00:04:25,816 A:middle
Those things could turn you
off and make you walk away.

90
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:30,066 A:middle
But if the staff is inviting and
the environment is comfortable,

91
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,396 A:middle
well, you might stick around,
explore the merchandise.

92
00:04:34,896 --> 00:04:39,096 A:middle
So the best approach with
apps or games is that you want

93
00:04:39,096 --> 00:04:42,196 A:middle
to get people in and using
them as quickly as possible.

94
00:04:43,306 --> 00:04:45,146 A:middle
You just want to let
people jump right in,

95
00:04:45,146 --> 00:04:48,966 A:middle
and sometimes that's
not always possible.

96
00:04:49,396 --> 00:04:53,576 A:middle
Now, there are a number of
reasons for having onboarding

97
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:58,746 A:middle
and having a confusing or poorly
executed UI is not one of them.

98
00:04:59,556 --> 00:05:04,016 A:middle
So you want to make sure if
your UI isn't intuitive and easy

99

100
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

101
00:04:59,556 --> 00:05:04,016 A:middle
So you want to make sure if
your UI isn't intuitive and easy

102
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:06,336 A:middle
to use, spend time
refining that UI,

103
00:05:07,246 --> 00:05:10,066 A:middle
not building an onboarding
sequence, OK?

104
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:14,026 A:middle
Now, if you have
registration required

105
00:05:14,126 --> 00:05:16,936 A:middle
to use your application,
that's a different story.

106
00:05:19,036 --> 00:05:21,056 A:middle
Or with games.

107
00:05:21,896 --> 00:05:25,946 A:middle
You might need to explain
the backstory or the rules,

108
00:05:25,946 --> 00:05:27,536 A:middle
you know, how games are played.

109
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:31,426 A:middle
Or if your UI is heavily
reliant on gestures,

110
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,826 A:middle
that might warrant a
little bit of information

111
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:34,966 A:middle
in order to get started.

112
00:05:35,746 --> 00:05:38,776 A:middle
So let's talk briefly
about if you have

113
00:05:38,776 --> 00:05:40,186 A:middle
to require registration.

114
00:05:40,956 --> 00:05:44,416 A:middle
Sometimes, it is absolutely
necessary to see anything,

115
00:05:44,486 --> 00:05:50,396 A:middle
like a banking application or
social networks or bill pay,

116
00:05:50,396 --> 00:05:53,536 A:middle
anything that has personal
information, then you're going

117
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:56,886 A:middle
to need to let people
know what's going on.

118
00:05:57,276 --> 00:06:02,586 A:middle
But before, if there's any way
possible, you want to delay

119

120
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

121
00:05:57,276 --> 00:06:02,586 A:middle
But before, if there's any way
possible, you want to delay

122
00:06:02,586 --> 00:06:05,536 A:middle
that registration until
it's absolutely necessary.

123
00:06:06,146 --> 00:06:09,666 A:middle
Now, the iTunes store is
a great example of this.

124
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:13,476 A:middle
You can browse and look at
all the books and the music

125
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:16,426 A:middle
and the movies that you want,
and it's only when you go

126
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:20,746 A:middle
to buy something that you need
to authenticate or register.

127
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:23,696 A:middle
So this means there's
nothing standing in the way

128
00:06:23,696 --> 00:06:25,186 A:middle
of finding something you love.

129
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:28,886 A:middle
Requiring people to register
before they can see anything

130
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:31,936 A:middle
puts this unnecessary
obstacle in their way.

131
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:34,826 A:middle
They have to trust that it's
going to be worth their while

132
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:36,406 A:middle
to go through that obstacle.

133
00:06:37,686 --> 00:06:40,256 A:middle
Here is a better way,
this is "JUKELY,"

134
00:06:40,456 --> 00:06:41,796 A:middle
and it's a concert-finding app.

135
00:06:42,606 --> 00:06:43,906 A:middle
They've got a great design.

136
00:06:43,906 --> 00:06:47,356 A:middle
They'll help you find
concerts that are local to you,

137
00:06:47,356 --> 00:06:50,666 A:middle
tailored to your taste - they
will even find someone to go

138
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:51,726 A:middle
to the concert with you.

139
00:06:52,686 --> 00:06:55,596 A:middle
Now, not only do they have a
very short onboarding sequence,

140
00:06:55,736 --> 00:07:00,046 A:middle
but they will let you browse
without registering at all.

141

142
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

143
00:06:55,736 --> 00:07:00,046 A:middle
but they will let you browse
without registering at all.

144
00:07:00,976 --> 00:07:04,586 A:middle
You just tap that "skip this
for now" text at the bottom,

145
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:06,426 A:middle
and you can go right inside

146
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,336 A:middle
and explore what the
app is all about.

147
00:07:09,076 --> 00:07:12,126 A:middle
You can look at the concert
listings, read about bands,

148
00:07:12,706 --> 00:07:15,476 A:middle
and it's only when you
express interest in something

149
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,306 A:middle
or you want to buy some tickets,
well, that's when they have -

150
00:07:18,436 --> 00:07:21,616 A:middle
they ask you to sign
up, and that's great.

151
00:07:22,406 --> 00:07:25,386 A:middle
This approach lets you see
what that app is all about.

152
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,896 A:middle
You can explore everything,
all the concerts in your area,

153
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:31,686 A:middle
and you only have to
register when you're ready

154
00:07:31,686 --> 00:07:33,046 A:middle
to take action on something.

155
00:07:34,256 --> 00:07:36,576 A:middle
People are going to
be much more motivated

156
00:07:36,576 --> 00:07:38,916 A:middle
and quite frankly
comfortable going

157
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,906 A:middle
through that registration
process if they're confident

158
00:07:41,906 --> 00:07:44,426 A:middle
in the quality and the utility

159
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,486 A:middle
of what your app
is offering them.

160
00:07:47,696 --> 00:07:49,966 A:middle
Now, when it's time
to have people go

161
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:51,266 A:middle
through that registration,

162
00:07:51,936 --> 00:07:55,646 A:middle
you want to explain why you're
asking them to register.

163
00:07:56,216 --> 00:08:00,596 A:middle
So think about it this way,
let's say a stranger walked

164

165
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

166
00:07:56,216 --> 00:08:00,596 A:middle
So think about it this way,
let's say a stranger walked

167
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:02,936 A:middle
up to you in front of
Moscone and said, "Hey,

168
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:05,396 A:middle
can I have your email
address and phone number?"

169
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:07,466 A:middle
You wouldn't give
it to him, right?

170
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:10,086 A:middle
That's just creepy, and you
have no idea what's going

171
00:08:10,086 --> 00:08:11,696 A:middle
to happen with that data.

172
00:08:13,246 --> 00:08:16,666 A:middle
Now, that's exactly what
you're doing if you ask people

173
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,646 A:middle
to register but you're
not telling them why,

174
00:08:18,646 --> 00:08:20,566 A:middle
and they don't know
anything about you.

175
00:08:21,996 --> 00:08:26,596 A:middle
It's especially important in
cases where you have to register

176
00:08:26,596 --> 00:08:30,696 A:middle
in order to use an app
because your description

177
00:08:30,696 --> 00:08:32,876 A:middle
in the App Store,
or word of mouth,

178
00:08:33,405 --> 00:08:35,376 A:middle
or brand awareness isn't enough

179
00:08:35,635 --> 00:08:38,076 A:middle
to make people feel
comfortable giving you all

180
00:08:38,076 --> 00:08:39,566 A:middle
of their personal information.

181
00:08:40,426 --> 00:08:43,846 A:middle
You need to make it really clear
what you're going to do with it.

182
00:08:44,616 --> 00:08:48,126 A:middle
So this is "Jelly" and they
crowdsource the answers

183
00:08:48,256 --> 00:08:50,146 A:middle
to questions from
your social network.

184
00:08:50,686 --> 00:08:52,586 A:middle
So they have a real challenge -

185
00:08:52,626 --> 00:08:54,406 A:middle
there really is nothing
they can show you

186
00:08:54,406 --> 00:08:56,206 A:middle
without you registering
and signing in.

187
00:08:56,656 --> 00:08:59,476 A:middle
So that's why they've given
you this brief explanation

188
00:08:59,686 --> 00:09:00,996 A:middle
of what the service is about

189

190
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

191
00:08:59,686 --> 00:09:00,996 A:middle
of what the service is about

192
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:03,936 A:middle
and explain why they
need your information.

193
00:09:05,106 --> 00:09:07,816 A:middle
And very importantly, they let
you know that they're not going

194
00:09:07,816 --> 00:09:09,656 A:middle
to post anything automatically.

195
00:09:10,946 --> 00:09:14,876 A:middle
And this is very important
because when you're dealing

196
00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:17,246 A:middle
with people's personal
information,

197
00:09:17,346 --> 00:09:18,026 A:middle
you want to make sure

198
00:09:18,026 --> 00:09:19,776 A:middle
that they're comfortable
giving it to you.

199
00:09:20,106 --> 00:09:23,016 A:middle
They want to know that you're
going to protect their privacy.

200
00:09:23,016 --> 00:09:28,236 A:middle
And transparency around privacy
is particularly important

201
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:30,476 A:middle
if you're dealing with
social network integration

202
00:09:31,086 --> 00:09:33,016 A:middle
because I'm sure we've
all had that friend

203
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:36,656 A:middle
that he's got some app that's
going crazy on their timeline

204
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:38,806 A:middle
and you're thinking, "Oh
what a noob," you know,

205
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:40,086 A:middle
nobody checked their settings,

206
00:09:40,086 --> 00:09:41,296 A:middle
they didn't know
what they were doing.

207
00:09:42,186 --> 00:09:44,786 A:middle
And nowhere is this more
the case when you're dealing

208
00:09:44,786 --> 00:09:46,166 A:middle
with dating applications,

209
00:09:46,826 --> 00:09:48,926 A:middle
because that would
be a nightmare.

210
00:09:49,576 --> 00:09:51,996 A:middle
All of a sudden, all your
friends and your family

211
00:09:51,996 --> 00:09:55,126 A:middle
and some people that you kind of
know from work or met some time

212
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:58,376 A:middle
in a bar could see who you
liked and who you didn't like.

213
00:09:59,096 --> 00:09:59,936 A:middle
Nobody wants that.

214

215
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

216
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:04,756 A:middle
So "Tinder" here is a very
popular dating application

217
00:10:04,756 --> 00:10:09,396 A:middle
and they're very explicit: They
are never going to post anything

218
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:10,936 A:middle
to Facebook on your behalf.

219
00:10:12,036 --> 00:10:14,426 A:middle
And this is hugely
important because the way that

220
00:10:14,476 --> 00:10:16,926 A:middle
"Tinder" works is
they're asking you if you

221
00:10:16,926 --> 00:10:18,876 A:middle
like people based
on their picture.

222
00:10:19,606 --> 00:10:21,586 A:middle
So if you have any doubts at all

223
00:10:21,586 --> 00:10:23,286 A:middle
or you're feeling
a little hesitant,

224
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,236 A:middle
you can tap that i button,

225
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:27,236 A:middle
and they spell it
out in more detail.

226
00:10:27,846 --> 00:10:30,956 A:middle
They take your privacy
very seriously.

227
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:34,606 A:middle
They're never going to
post on Facebook for you.

228
00:10:34,896 --> 00:10:36,576 A:middle
They're not going to
give away your location.

229
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:40,036 A:middle
So people can feel reassured
and more comfortable.

230
00:10:41,116 --> 00:10:45,106 A:middle
And nowhere is this privacy
going to be more important

231
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:46,876 A:middle
than with your social
integration.

232
00:10:47,306 --> 00:10:51,176 A:middle
Now I've just given you a whole
lot of advice about things

233
00:10:51,176 --> 00:10:52,966 A:middle
to tell people before
they register,

234
00:10:53,506 --> 00:10:55,806 A:middle
but I want to encourage you that
when you're telling them all

235
00:10:55,806 --> 00:10:58,126 A:middle
of these things, be succinct.

236
00:10:58,476 --> 00:11:00,486 A:middle
Be as succinct as possible.

237

238
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

239
00:10:58,476 --> 00:11:00,486 A:middle
Be as succinct as possible.

240
00:11:01,366 --> 00:11:02,616 A:middle
We all know that people don't

241
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:06,176 A:middle
like to read long passages
of texts on an app.

242
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:08,286 A:middle
They just tap, tap,
tap and get going so.

243
00:11:09,286 --> 00:11:10,886 A:middle
"Uber" does a great
job with this.

244
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:13,756 A:middle
If you haven't experienced
"Uber" yet in San Francisco,

245
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,496 A:middle
it's a car service, so
they'll come pick you up,

246
00:11:17,496 --> 00:11:19,036 A:middle
kind of like a taxi.

247
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:21,026 A:middle
And you might think,
"Well, why do I have

248
00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:24,316 A:middle
to give them an email address
and a phone number just in order

249
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,956 A:middle
to get a ride from A to B?"

250
00:11:26,796 --> 00:11:31,256 A:middle
And they explain here very
briefly, they're going

251
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:34,666 A:middle
to send you notifications
about when the car is coming

252
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,526 A:middle
and emails about
the confirmation.

253
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:40,726 A:middle
So that makes you feel better.

254
00:11:40,786 --> 00:11:45,296 A:middle
So being succinct will keep
your registration process short,

255
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:48,556 A:middle
and it will help encourage
people to actually read the text

256
00:11:48,556 --> 00:11:52,756 A:middle
that you've so carefully
crafted for that screen.

257
00:11:52,926 --> 00:11:55,326 A:middle
Now, another way that you
can make the process short is

258
00:11:55,326 --> 00:11:58,476 A:middle
to only collect what
you need right now.

259
00:11:59,806 --> 00:12:02,636 A:middle
Don't be tempted to ask
for a lot of information

260

261
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

262
00:11:59,806 --> 00:12:02,636 A:middle
Don't be tempted to ask
for a lot of information

263
00:12:02,636 --> 00:12:04,226 A:middle
because you have
this great feature

264
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:06,136 A:middle
and you're probably
going to do it someday,

265
00:12:06,136 --> 00:12:08,806 A:middle
or maybe you're thinking about
doing this, so let's get date

266
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:12,416 A:middle
of birth and let's ask their
gender and - you only want

267
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,436 A:middle
to take what it is that
you're going to use

268
00:12:15,306 --> 00:12:17,866 A:middle
and what you've told the users
that you're going to do with it

269
00:12:18,176 --> 00:12:20,636 A:middle
so that people feel
comfortable giving it to you.

270
00:12:21,596 --> 00:12:24,696 A:middle
Otherwise, people are
going to be suspicious,

271
00:12:24,796 --> 00:12:27,076 A:middle
and that could prevent
them from actually going

272
00:12:27,076 --> 00:12:28,646 A:middle
through the registration
process.

273
00:12:29,186 --> 00:12:33,626 A:middle
So, if you do need people
to register in order

274
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:36,506 A:middle
to use your app, keep
these things in mind,

275
00:12:37,286 --> 00:12:39,106 A:middle
follow these guidelines
and everyone is going

276
00:12:39,106 --> 00:12:41,116 A:middle
to feel really comfortable
and motivated

277
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,556 A:middle
to give you their information.

278
00:12:43,976 --> 00:12:45,816 A:middle
All right, so now, let's get

279
00:12:45,816 --> 00:12:47,856 A:middle
into the onboarding
best practices.

280
00:12:48,596 --> 00:12:54,916 A:middle
As I said earlier, the best
experience is going to be

281
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:58,386 A:middle
to just jump in and start
using that app right away.

282
00:12:59,006 --> 00:13:02,346 A:middle
So you want to ask yourselves,
"What do people need to know

283

284
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

285
00:12:59,006 --> 00:13:02,346 A:middle
So you want to ask yourselves,
"What do people need to know

286
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:03,916 A:middle
in order to get started
with my app?"

287
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:08,266 A:middle
And if the answer is
nothing, fantastic.

288
00:13:09,226 --> 00:13:10,556 A:middle
Don't put any onboarding in.

289
00:13:11,006 --> 00:13:11,566 A:middle
You're great.

290
00:13:11,596 --> 00:13:13,536 A:middle
Just let them in and
let them get going.

291
00:13:14,816 --> 00:13:18,556 A:middle
Now, if there are some things
like the rules for a game

292
00:13:18,556 --> 00:13:20,776 A:middle
or like the gestures that
they might need to know,

293
00:13:21,716 --> 00:13:24,036 A:middle
you want to tell them
just enough to get started

294
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,406 A:middle
and then get out
of the way quickly.

295
00:13:27,636 --> 00:13:32,056 A:middle
So think about if you went into
a restaurant, and before you sat

296
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:34,196 A:middle
down at the table,
the host said, "OK,

297
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:35,206 A:middle
welcome to the restaurant.

298
00:13:35,206 --> 00:13:37,956 A:middle
I'm going to tell you
every single thing

299
00:13:37,956 --> 00:13:40,656 A:middle
on the menu right
now in great detail.

300
00:13:41,026 --> 00:13:42,326 A:middle
And by the way, here
are the things

301
00:13:42,326 --> 00:13:43,576 A:middle
that I think you should order."

302
00:13:44,626 --> 00:13:46,096 A:middle
That would be ridiculous, right?

303
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:49,316 A:middle
So pushy. You really
just want to come in,

304
00:13:49,316 --> 00:13:52,406 A:middle
get settled at your table,
peruse the menu at your leisure.

305
00:13:52,406 --> 00:13:55,196 A:middle
That's the experience
that you're after, right?

306
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,746 A:middle
So that's what you
need to re-create

307
00:13:57,746 --> 00:13:59,246 A:middle
in your app or your game.

308

309
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

310
00:14:00,076 --> 00:14:01,526 A:middle
You want to do that equivalent

311
00:14:01,626 --> 00:14:03,556 A:middle
of leading people
in to their table.

312
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:06,596 A:middle
Maybe you're going to tell them
the specials in a restaurant,

313
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:10,056 A:middle
and then let them
explore on their own.

314
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:14,356 A:middle
When people launch an app
or a game, they're expecting

315
00:14:14,406 --> 00:14:17,346 A:middle
to participate, they're not
expecting a long lecture.

316
00:14:18,546 --> 00:14:22,606 A:middle
So imagine you launched
"Calculator" app

317
00:14:22,606 --> 00:14:27,176 A:middle
and you saw something like
this, followed by this,

318
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:31,576 A:middle
followed by this, oh my gosh.

319
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:35,376 A:middle
Now, I'm not going to make
you guys sit through all seven

320
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:39,076 A:middle
of these but you can see how
frustrating that would be

321
00:14:39,456 --> 00:14:42,366 A:middle
if you're faced with a long
list of marketing messages

322
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:44,666 A:middle
about an app before
you even got to use it.

323
00:14:44,756 --> 00:14:46,296 A:middle
I mean, it's a calculator,
right?

324
00:14:47,276 --> 00:14:52,576 A:middle
So really, resist the temptation
to string together a whole lot

325
00:14:52,576 --> 00:14:55,726 A:middle
of long list of features
and marketing and hey,

326
00:14:55,726 --> 00:14:57,126 A:middle
make sure you check
this thing out.

327
00:14:57,716 --> 00:14:59,416 A:middle
People want to get
in and get going.

328

329
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

330
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,386 A:middle
There is no need
for instructions

331
00:15:02,576 --> 00:15:05,666 A:middle
if the user interface
is intuitive to use

332
00:15:05,986 --> 00:15:07,436 A:middle
and the functionality
is obvious.

333
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:10,766 A:middle
And if it isn't, I suggest

334
00:15:10,766 --> 00:15:15,166 A:middle
that you spend time reworking
the design, not sticking a bunch

335
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:19,626 A:middle
of onboarding screens on there.

336
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,726 A:middle
If you need to give a few UI
tips, you want to do it quickly

337
00:15:22,726 --> 00:15:24,346 A:middle
and get out of the
way, but otherwise,

338
00:15:24,346 --> 00:15:28,876 A:middle
avoid those long
marketing messages, OK?

339
00:15:29,436 --> 00:15:32,346 A:middle
Now, you always want to
start with the basics

340
00:15:32,676 --> 00:15:34,576 A:middle
and this is especially
important for games,

341
00:15:34,746 --> 00:15:36,246 A:middle
which are most often the place

342
00:15:36,246 --> 00:15:38,446 A:middle
where you need a little
information to get going.

343
00:15:39,576 --> 00:15:42,006 A:middle
Like with video games
with our App Store games,

344
00:15:42,136 --> 00:15:44,636 A:middle
you might want the backstory
so you know, you know,

345
00:15:44,636 --> 00:15:45,926 A:middle
what's the objective
of the game?

346
00:15:46,186 --> 00:15:47,926 A:middle
Or the backstory makes
it more fun, right?

347
00:15:48,926 --> 00:15:50,496 A:middle
But think about a
card game that you sit

348
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:51,746 A:middle
down to play with friends.

349
00:15:52,406 --> 00:15:55,116 A:middle
First, you usually go over
OK, what are the rules?

350
00:15:55,396 --> 00:15:56,566 A:middle
How does play progress?

351
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:57,446 A:middle
How do you win?

352
00:15:57,616 --> 00:15:58,616 A:middle
That's an important one.

353
00:15:59,256 --> 00:16:01,326 A:middle
And then you might even
try a couple of tips

354

355
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

356
00:15:59,256 --> 00:16:01,326 A:middle
And then you might even
try a couple of tips

357
00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:05,206 A:middle
on strategy all before
you start playing.

358
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:08,326 A:middle
So just like that card game,
you start with the basics

359
00:16:08,326 --> 00:16:10,926 A:middle
and then you build up the
complexity from there.

360
00:16:11,926 --> 00:16:13,536 A:middle
Because you're not going
to be prepared to learn

361
00:16:13,536 --> 00:16:15,346 A:middle
about strategies for winning

362
00:16:15,346 --> 00:16:17,156 A:middle
if you don't understand
how the game is played

363
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:17,896 A:middle
in the first place.

364
00:16:17,956 --> 00:16:21,836 A:middle
Let's look at a great
example, this is "Dots,"

365
00:16:22,586 --> 00:16:23,916 A:middle
and "Dots" is a puzzle game.

366
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:26,696 A:middle
They need just a
little bit of onboarding

367
00:16:26,696 --> 00:16:30,336 A:middle
to explain how the game works,
and they've also touched

368
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:31,836 A:middle
on the inspiration for the game.

369
00:16:31,836 --> 00:16:34,596 A:middle
They've got this quote here,
"A smart man once said,

370
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:37,196 A:middle
'Everything eventually
connects.'" OK.

371
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:43,006 A:middle
So the first thing, two
dots, connect them, got it.

372
00:16:43,266 --> 00:16:47,536 A:middle
Now, a couple more dots.

373
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:49,606 A:middle
Now different colors of dots.

374
00:16:50,516 --> 00:16:55,956 A:middle
[ Game Sounds ]

375
00:16:56,456 --> 00:16:59,146 A:middle
Pretty basic, but they're
building up the complexity

376
00:16:59,146 --> 00:17:01,266 A:middle
as you go, and they're
reinforcing everything

377

378
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

379
00:16:59,146 --> 00:17:01,266 A:middle
as you go, and they're
reinforcing everything

380
00:17:01,266 --> 00:17:05,156 A:middle
with sound and animation
and positive reassurance

381
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:06,146 A:middle
as you're going through.

382
00:17:06,146 --> 00:17:08,016 A:middle
So it is completely interactive.

383
00:17:08,016 --> 00:17:11,685 A:middle
So that's a great
way to get started.

384
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:15,516 A:middle
And now, I know that this seems
like a pretty simple example,

385
00:17:15,516 --> 00:17:18,576 A:middle
but really, almost any kind
of game benefits from this:

386
00:17:18,576 --> 00:17:21,445 A:middle
builders, role-playing games,
arcade games, all of it.

387
00:17:22,236 --> 00:17:23,806 A:middle
Let's take a look
at "Hitman GO."

388
00:17:24,406 --> 00:17:27,826 A:middle
Now, "Hitman GO" has eliminated
onboarding altogether.

389
00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:30,296 A:middle
They just put you in
the game right away.

390
00:17:30,296 --> 00:17:31,436 A:middle
It's a great experience.

391
00:17:32,236 --> 00:17:34,576 A:middle
But to set people
up for success,

392
00:17:35,226 --> 00:17:38,496 A:middle
the very basic levels
start - the first levels

393
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:40,896 A:middle
that you play start
with very basic actions.

394
00:17:41,566 --> 00:17:43,166 A:middle
So what's the first
thing you need to know

395
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,496 A:middle
in order to play this game?

396
00:17:44,776 --> 00:17:50,056 A:middle
Well, that's how to move
and how to win, right?

397
00:17:50,786 --> 00:17:55,576 A:middle
OK, we got a straight line,
I only have one choice.

398
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:57,816 A:middle
All right, one more choice.

399
00:17:58,436 --> 00:17:59,596 A:middle
Hooray. Success.

400
00:17:59,596 --> 00:18:02,036 A:middle
I mean, it was very easy.

401

402
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

403
00:17:59,596 --> 00:18:02,036 A:middle
I mean, it was very easy.

404
00:18:02,036 --> 00:18:04,856 A:middle
It's a no-lose situation,
but that's teaching you.

405
00:18:04,976 --> 00:18:05,946 A:middle
What's the objective?

406
00:18:06,226 --> 00:18:07,246 A:middle
I want to get to that big,

407
00:18:07,246 --> 00:18:09,186 A:middle
dark circle at the end
of the screen, right?

408
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:13,636 A:middle
How do I move along the path?

409
00:18:13,756 --> 00:18:15,976 A:middle
Next, they introduce
you to obstacles.

410
00:18:20,076 --> 00:18:23,336 A:middle
Again, I've got one
path, and I'm a hit man,

411
00:18:23,546 --> 00:18:25,056 A:middle
and this guy's back
is towards me

412
00:18:25,056 --> 00:18:32,276 A:middle
so he was a pretty easy target.

413
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:36,106 A:middle
Again, it's a can't-lose
level, but I'm playing the game

414
00:18:36,106 --> 00:18:38,246 A:middle
and I'm learning as
I go, so it's fun.

415
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:39,296 A:middle
It's not onboarding.

416
00:18:39,476 --> 00:18:40,536 A:middle
I'm playing a game here.

417
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:44,946 A:middle
Now as the levels progress,
they get more difficult.

418
00:18:44,946 --> 00:18:46,456 A:middle
You get choices in your path,

419
00:18:46,456 --> 00:18:49,476 A:middle
and now your obstacle here
is facing you so that's going

420
00:18:49,476 --> 00:18:50,496 A:middle
to be a little trickier.

421
00:18:50,556 --> 00:18:53,316 A:middle
And trust me, it gets
much, much harder.

422
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:56,726 A:middle
You get different kinds of
obstacles, more of them.

423
00:18:56,726 --> 00:18:58,006 A:middle
Trapdoors and things like that.

424
00:18:59,296 --> 00:19:01,166 A:middle
When you first start
playing, all you have

425

426
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

427
00:18:59,296 --> 00:19:01,166 A:middle
When you first start
playing, all you have

428
00:19:01,216 --> 00:19:02,906 A:middle
to do is complete the level.

429
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:07,096 A:middle
Get to that dark
circle at the end.

430
00:19:07,096 --> 00:19:10,236 A:middle
But the more you play, the
more challenges you have.

431
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:12,586 A:middle
So now, I'm not just
completing the level,

432
00:19:12,746 --> 00:19:14,666 A:middle
I need to collect the briefcase,

433
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,246 A:middle
I got to do it in
12 moves or less.

434
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:19,576 A:middle
It's getting more complex.

435
00:19:20,316 --> 00:19:22,816 A:middle
And this is giving
me more challenges

436
00:19:22,816 --> 00:19:25,006 A:middle
and it's encouraging
repeat gameplay as well.

437
00:19:25,006 --> 00:19:29,076 A:middle
I mean, because if you had to
start on this level, hoo-wee,

438
00:19:29,516 --> 00:19:32,036 A:middle
I think that would last
all of about 30 seconds,

439
00:19:32,036 --> 00:19:33,926 A:middle
and then I'd be off
to find another game.

440
00:19:34,536 --> 00:19:37,486 A:middle
Now starting simply and building

441
00:19:37,486 --> 00:19:39,386 A:middle
up the complexity is
called scaffolding.

442
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:42,486 A:middle
And that's how you
can set up new players

443
00:19:42,486 --> 00:19:44,456 A:middle
to have an enjoyable experience.

444
00:19:44,926 --> 00:19:46,836 A:middle
It's going to keep them
coming back to your game.

445
00:19:48,006 --> 00:19:50,196 A:middle
But this approach also
works for apps as well.

446
00:19:50,226 --> 00:19:54,026 A:middle
You want to teach the basic
things, how to navigate

447
00:19:54,156 --> 00:19:55,776 A:middle
and the general purpose
functions,

448
00:19:56,326 --> 00:19:58,936 A:middle
before you even consider
trying to teach people

449
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,766 A:middle
about more advanced operations.

450

451
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

452
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,766 A:middle
about more advanced operations.

453
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:04,526 A:middle
Now, this is "Yahoo!

454
00:20:04,526 --> 00:20:05,286 A:middle
News Digest."

455
00:20:05,426 --> 00:20:08,066 A:middle
It's one of this year's
Apple Design Award winners.

456
00:20:08,856 --> 00:20:10,686 A:middle
Now, they've got a fantastic UI

457
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,286 A:middle
as you might have
guessed by their award.

458
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:15,516 A:middle
It's intuitive to use, so none

459
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:19,746 A:middle
of their onboarding
is covering UI.

460
00:20:19,906 --> 00:20:21,816 A:middle
Now, the way that
its news works is

461
00:20:21,816 --> 00:20:23,616 A:middle
that it's a daily
digest twice a day.

462
00:20:23,616 --> 00:20:27,336 A:middle
And this is an entirely new
paradigm for Yahoo News,

463
00:20:27,336 --> 00:20:29,386 A:middle
who have quite an
established audience.

464
00:20:30,106 --> 00:20:33,566 A:middle
So it's really important to
set people's expectations

465
00:20:33,686 --> 00:20:36,686 A:middle
about the content that they
were going to be seeing.

466
00:20:36,686 --> 00:20:38,276 A:middle
Otherwise, people
might be confused

467
00:20:38,276 --> 00:20:39,396 A:middle
about the purpose of the app.

468
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,546 A:middle
So by putting together
just three short screens

469
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:45,106 A:middle
with the supportive
illustrations,

470
00:20:45,106 --> 00:20:49,286 A:middle
and then getting you right into
the news, they're setting you

471
00:20:49,286 --> 00:20:51,166 A:middle
up for success in a
different kind of way.

472
00:20:52,056 --> 00:20:54,516 A:middle
And this approach
is not appropriate

473
00:20:54,516 --> 00:20:56,176 A:middle
for all kinds of apps or games.

474
00:20:56,776 --> 00:20:59,136 A:middle
It's really when you're
breaking into a new market

475
00:20:59,256 --> 00:21:01,636 A:middle
or that you're establishing
some sort of new paradigm

476

477
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

478
00:20:59,256 --> 00:21:01,636 A:middle
or that you're establishing
some sort of new paradigm

479
00:21:02,116 --> 00:21:04,396 A:middle
that you might need to
communicate just a little bit

480
00:21:04,856 --> 00:21:05,936 A:middle
about your core concept.

481
00:21:05,936 --> 00:21:09,276 A:middle
And that's going to help
people understand the products

482
00:21:09,276 --> 00:21:11,076 A:middle
and quite frankly,
appreciate it, right?

483
00:21:11,906 --> 00:21:15,256 A:middle
So, just three short screens and
then getting you into the news

484
00:21:15,256 --> 00:21:16,946 A:middle
because they're going to
get out of the way quickly.

485
00:21:17,496 --> 00:21:21,726 A:middle
So think about the basic, basic
things that people would need

486
00:21:21,726 --> 00:21:24,076 A:middle
to know in order to
start playing your game

487
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:25,786 A:middle
or using your app.

488
00:21:25,856 --> 00:21:28,676 A:middle
And think about if any of
them really need explaining,

489
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:32,176 A:middle
because again, if you
don't - if they don't,

490
00:21:32,176 --> 00:21:33,596 A:middle
don't do any onboarding, right?

491
00:21:33,956 --> 00:21:38,006 A:middle
But if you do, consider
the ways that you can start

492
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,596 A:middle
with the basics and
build up the complexity.

493
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,296 A:middle
With games, it's going to be how
to move, what's the objective,

494
00:21:44,676 --> 00:21:46,426 A:middle
how do you win and
things like that.

495
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:49,186 A:middle
And when you're teaching
these things,

496
00:21:50,036 --> 00:21:52,716 A:middle
make sure you're only
teaching one thing at a time.

497
00:21:53,766 --> 00:21:57,126 A:middle
It is so much harder to learn
if you're dealt with a bunch

498
00:21:57,126 --> 00:21:59,326 A:middle
of instructions at
once or if it's -

499
00:21:59,326 --> 00:22:01,606 A:middle
especially if it's related to
something unfamiliar, right?

500

501
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

502
00:21:59,326 --> 00:22:01,606 A:middle
especially if it's related to
something unfamiliar, right?

503
00:22:02,436 --> 00:22:04,726 A:middle
OK, I'm going to give all of
you guys some instructions.

504
00:22:05,796 --> 00:22:10,396 A:middle
After this, I want you to leave
Moscone, make two left turns,

505
00:22:10,686 --> 00:22:12,026 A:middle
then a right down the alleyway.

506
00:22:12,606 --> 00:22:15,926 A:middle
Go to the coffee shop on the
corner, order two lattes,

507
00:22:16,216 --> 00:22:18,356 A:middle
one decaf, one low fat.

508
00:22:19,236 --> 00:22:21,726 A:middle
Put three sugars in the
decaf one and one sugar

509
00:22:21,726 --> 00:22:23,876 A:middle
in the low fat one and then
bring them back to me here.

510
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:29,346 A:middle
Got it? If anyone got
that, I'm looking forward

511
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:30,416 A:middle
to my latte after this.

512
00:22:31,006 --> 00:22:33,836 A:middle
But you can see how
difficult that is.

513
00:22:33,836 --> 00:22:36,256 A:middle
I'm sure you guys are all
tuned out on step three.

514
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:39,966 A:middle
People are going to
be much more able

515
00:22:39,966 --> 00:22:41,216 A:middle
to follow those instructions

516
00:22:41,216 --> 00:22:43,096 A:middle
if they're parceled
out one at a time.

517
00:22:43,866 --> 00:22:47,056 A:middle
So if I said, "Go out of
Moscone, make two left turns,

518
00:22:47,756 --> 00:22:49,266 A:middle
and then when you
get to the corner,

519
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:50,406 A:middle
I'll tell you what to do."

520
00:22:50,486 --> 00:22:52,906 A:middle
And then I'll say, "Go
to the coffee shop."

521
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:56,196 A:middle
And then when you get to the
register, I text you, "Hey,

522
00:22:56,196 --> 00:22:58,316 A:middle
here's the coffee that
I want you to order" -

523
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:01,016 A:middle
this would be so much easier.

524

525
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

526
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:01,016 A:middle
this would be so much easier.

527
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,806 A:middle
So you want to give
instructions one at a time

528
00:23:05,346 --> 00:23:06,286 A:middle
and give people a chance

529
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:08,546 A:middle
to apply those instructions
before you start teaching

530
00:23:08,546 --> 00:23:09,826 A:middle
anything else.

531
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:12,906 A:middle
So this is "Leo's
Fortune," another one

532
00:23:12,906 --> 00:23:15,346 A:middle
of our Apple Design Award
winners from this year.

533
00:23:16,306 --> 00:23:19,746 A:middle
It's a really fun
platform adventure game set

534
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:21,446 A:middle
in these really gorgeous
environments.

535
00:23:22,586 --> 00:23:25,626 A:middle
And their tutorial
level is fantastic.

536
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:28,566 A:middle
They first start
to explain the game

537
00:23:28,566 --> 00:23:29,896 A:middle
with a little bit of backstory.

538
00:23:30,036 --> 00:23:31,646 A:middle
They introduce you to Leopold.

539
00:23:32,406 --> 00:23:35,116 A:middle
They let you know he's lost
his fortune and you're going

540
00:23:35,116 --> 00:23:35,946 A:middle
to help him reclaim it.

541
00:23:37,056 --> 00:23:40,216 A:middle
So this translates into
"get the gold coins."

542
00:23:40,566 --> 00:23:42,066 A:middle
Now you got your
objective, right?

543
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:46,956 A:middle
Next step is just about
how to hold your device.

544
00:23:47,866 --> 00:23:50,406 A:middle
They're getting you used to
this idea that the left side

545
00:23:50,406 --> 00:23:52,576 A:middle
of the screen and the right
side of the screen are going

546
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,596 A:middle
to do something different,

547
00:23:54,406 --> 00:23:55,896 A:middle
but they haven't told
you what that is yet.

548
00:23:56,816 --> 00:23:58,686 A:middle
Just put your thumbs
in this position,

549
00:23:58,686 --> 00:24:01,726 A:middle
and that gets you holding
the device in the best way.

550

551
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

552
00:23:58,686 --> 00:24:01,726 A:middle
and that gets you holding
the device in the best way.

553
00:24:03,346 --> 00:24:06,046 A:middle
Now, once you press your
thumbs in each circle,

554
00:24:06,136 --> 00:24:07,616 A:middle
then they're talking
about movement.

555
00:24:08,136 --> 00:24:09,626 A:middle
What do you do with
your left thumb?

556
00:24:09,706 --> 00:24:11,656 A:middle
Well first, we're
just going to forwards

557
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:14,206 A:middle
and backwards, the very basics.

558
00:24:14,206 --> 00:24:18,026 A:middle
And then you get a chance to
play with that a little bit.

559
00:24:18,026 --> 00:24:20,016 A:middle
You're going to collect
some coins, go through some

560
00:24:20,016 --> 00:24:21,026 A:middle
of the cool environments.

561
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:24,886 A:middle
And then, a slight obstacle.

562
00:24:25,306 --> 00:24:27,686 A:middle
Now, there's a little chalk
drawing to help you out

563
00:24:27,686 --> 00:24:28,906 A:middle
or some words on the right

564
00:24:28,906 --> 00:24:31,256 A:middle
that lets you know now
it's time you're going

565
00:24:31,256 --> 00:24:34,746 A:middle
to use your right thumb, here
we go, get up over that ledge.

566
00:24:35,436 --> 00:24:38,476 A:middle
And then, a chance to play.

567
00:24:38,696 --> 00:24:41,696 A:middle
They give you things to jump
over, things to jump onto.

568
00:24:41,696 --> 00:24:45,596 A:middle
And next step, some
more obstacles.

569
00:24:45,726 --> 00:24:48,456 A:middle
Here, it's about using that
up gesture for something else.

570
00:24:48,856 --> 00:24:49,606 A:middle
So they're building

571
00:24:49,606 --> 00:24:53,986 A:middle
up the complexity while teaching
you one thing at a time.

572
00:24:54,186 --> 00:24:56,766 A:middle
Pushing up on that lever is
going to release the drawbridge,

573
00:24:56,766 --> 00:24:58,956 A:middle
and then you can
continue on your way.

574

575
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

576
00:25:00,126 --> 00:25:03,626 A:middle
Then you'll learn about pushing
down and what that does for you.

577
00:25:04,816 --> 00:25:07,416 A:middle
So "Leo's Fortune" -
one skill at a time,

578
00:25:07,556 --> 00:25:10,776 A:middle
which is so manageable, and
it's fun because you're playing.

579
00:25:11,816 --> 00:25:14,006 A:middle
So it's a great example
of scaffolding,

580
00:25:14,766 --> 00:25:18,236 A:middle
along with "Hitman GO" and
several other examples.

581
00:25:19,826 --> 00:25:22,866 A:middle
So the first thing you do,
is you learn the objective,

582
00:25:23,786 --> 00:25:25,136 A:middle
collect those gold coins.

583
00:25:26,536 --> 00:25:27,576 A:middle
Next thing you're going to learn

584
00:25:27,576 --> 00:25:30,136 A:middle
about is the optimal
hand position, right?

585
00:25:30,206 --> 00:25:32,706 A:middle
So they're building up the
complexity with the scaffolding.

586
00:25:33,286 --> 00:25:35,686 A:middle
And the next thing
that you learn

587
00:25:35,686 --> 00:25:38,936 A:middle
about is really basic
movement - how to go forwards,

588
00:25:39,086 --> 00:25:42,546 A:middle
what are you doing
with your left hand?

589
00:25:42,716 --> 00:25:44,116 A:middle
Next step is obstacles,

590
00:25:44,606 --> 00:25:47,856 A:middle
which you conquer using your
right hand and various gestures.

591
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:49,756 A:middle
And then further in the game,

592
00:25:50,426 --> 00:25:53,096 A:middle
they start showing you
advanced obstacles or puzzles.

593
00:25:53,186 --> 00:25:57,626 A:middle
So you can see how the
complexity builds up that way.

594
00:25:57,846 --> 00:25:59,606 A:middle
Now like I said, the
same thing applies

595
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:01,236 A:middle
to apps, it's not just games.

596

597
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

598
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:01,236 A:middle
to apps, it's not just games.

599
00:26:01,566 --> 00:26:03,196 A:middle
You can teach people by doing.

600
00:26:03,226 --> 00:26:05,686 A:middle
You don't want to show them
a lot of screens upfront.

601
00:26:07,076 --> 00:26:08,966 A:middle
Now Pinterest - this
is Pinterest,

602
00:26:09,266 --> 00:26:12,156 A:middle
and they use onboarding
just for a specific feature.

603
00:26:12,366 --> 00:26:15,956 A:middle
So they have a new guided
search feature, and they needed

604
00:26:15,956 --> 00:26:17,436 A:middle
to teach people new to the app

605
00:26:17,616 --> 00:26:21,416 A:middle
and also returning users
how to go about using it.

606
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:23,946 A:middle
And they do a great
job of parceling

607
00:26:23,946 --> 00:26:26,056 A:middle
out this information
one step at a time.

608
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:28,726 A:middle
So the first time you
go to the Search tab

609
00:26:28,726 --> 00:26:30,286 A:middle
after this feature
was introduced,

610
00:26:30,286 --> 00:26:31,636 A:middle
you get a little
bit of information.

611
00:26:31,636 --> 00:26:34,126 A:middle
And they've given
you some samples.

612
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:37,426 A:middle
And these samples are all things
that I'm pretty interested in.

613
00:26:37,526 --> 00:26:39,346 A:middle
So they've done a great job

614
00:26:39,346 --> 00:26:42,136 A:middle
in making this a really
valuable exercise for me.

615
00:26:43,146 --> 00:26:48,056 A:middle
Now I happen to like nail art,
and so next I tap, they explain

616
00:26:48,056 --> 00:26:51,366 A:middle
to me how to refine that
search even further.

617
00:26:51,976 --> 00:26:55,856 A:middle
And then once I've
done some refinement,

618
00:26:55,856 --> 00:26:57,996 A:middle
they talk about even
more advanced refinement,

619
00:26:58,336 --> 00:26:59,286 A:middle
free typing in.

620

621
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

622
00:27:00,316 --> 00:27:03,026 A:middle
And because you're getting this
information one step at a time,

623
00:27:03,826 --> 00:27:06,156 A:middle
it's much easier to
understand what to do,

624
00:27:06,476 --> 00:27:09,096 A:middle
and they're letting you
execute on these instructions

625
00:27:09,206 --> 00:27:10,396 A:middle
so you're really learning.

626
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:11,796 A:middle
You're taking it all in.

627
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:13,296 A:middle
You're much more likely

628
00:27:13,296 --> 00:27:16,156 A:middle
to remember this later next time
you go to search for something.

629
00:27:16,696 --> 00:27:22,216 A:middle
With all of these examples,
it wasn't overwhelming, right?

630
00:27:22,396 --> 00:27:26,456 A:middle
And you're actually able
to use what you've learned

631
00:27:26,456 --> 00:27:29,126 A:middle
because you're playing
the game or using an app.

632
00:27:31,256 --> 00:27:36,216 A:middle
Because people learn better by
doing than they do by reading

633
00:27:36,496 --> 00:27:40,896 A:middle
or listening when it
comes to apps or games.

634
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:43,516 A:middle
"Dots," "Hitman GO,"
"Leo's Fortune" -

635
00:27:43,836 --> 00:27:46,006 A:middle
they all reinforce what
they're teaching you with play.

636
00:27:46,836 --> 00:27:49,466 A:middle
And Pinterest was letting you
actually search for things.

637
00:27:49,466 --> 00:27:51,036 A:middle
It wasn't a canned experience.

638
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,466 A:middle
Those were real search
terms with real refinements.

639
00:27:55,036 --> 00:27:58,766 A:middle
So even though this is
a really super easy,

640
00:27:58,766 --> 00:28:01,106 A:middle
can't-lose level
on "Hitman GO" -

641

642
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

643
00:27:58,766 --> 00:28:01,106 A:middle
can't-lose level
on "Hitman GO" -

644
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:09,646 A:middle
[ Game Sounds ]

645
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:13,616 A:middle
- it's a lot more fun
than this would be, right?

646
00:28:16,396 --> 00:28:19,196 A:middle
Now Benjamin Franklin has
a great quote about this:

647
00:28:20,086 --> 00:28:21,336 A:middle
"Tell me and I forget.

648
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:23,086 A:middle
Teach me and I remember.

649
00:28:23,346 --> 00:28:24,866 A:middle
Involve me and I learn."

650
00:28:25,566 --> 00:28:29,276 A:middle
That's why you want to avoid
screenshots and modal displays.

651
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:32,046 A:middle
Anything that's going to
take you out of context

652
00:28:32,046 --> 00:28:34,066 A:middle
or prevent you from
actually using the app

653
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:36,066 A:middle
or game isn't going
to be as effective.

654
00:28:36,066 --> 00:28:42,016 A:middle
Again, what if this was the
experience with calculator?

655
00:28:42,016 --> 00:28:43,476 A:middle
It would be terrible, right?

656
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:45,256 A:middle
First of all, the UI is

657
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,566 A:middle
so dimmed you can barely
see the buttons at all.

658
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:53,666 A:middle
Secondly, you don't need to say
tap here, tap here, tap here all

659
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:55,056 A:middle
over a touch interface.

660
00:28:55,426 --> 00:28:56,536 A:middle
It's a touch interface.

661
00:28:56,756 --> 00:29:00,546 A:middle
You tap. And my biggest pet
peeve is when I see "Click here"

662

663
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

664
00:28:56,756 --> 00:29:00,546 A:middle
You tap. And my biggest pet
peeve is when I see "Click here"

665
00:29:00,736 --> 00:29:05,446 A:middle
on touch devices - ooh,
that really gets me.

666
00:29:05,926 --> 00:29:10,086 A:middle
Now again, if your buttons don't
look obviously interactive,

667
00:29:10,756 --> 00:29:11,886 A:middle
redesign your buttons.

668
00:29:12,636 --> 00:29:14,646 A:middle
Don't put some modal
display letting you know

669
00:29:14,646 --> 00:29:15,926 A:middle
that you can tap places.

670
00:29:16,446 --> 00:29:20,336 A:middle
So if you do need onboarding,

671
00:29:20,936 --> 00:29:23,436 A:middle
make sure that your experience
lets people participate.

672
00:29:23,436 --> 00:29:28,766 A:middle
And you can use animation
to do a lot of teaching.

673
00:29:28,886 --> 00:29:30,376 A:middle
It's a really powerful tool.

674
00:29:30,996 --> 00:29:33,236 A:middle
And there is a lot of great
information about the craft

675
00:29:33,236 --> 00:29:35,556 A:middle
of the animation in Tuesday's

676
00:29:35,556 --> 00:29:37,666 A:middle
"Designing Intuitive
Interfaces" sessions.

677
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:39,276 A:middle
So if you didn't
see the session,

678
00:29:39,426 --> 00:29:40,996 A:middle
check out the video,
it's available.

679
00:29:42,336 --> 00:29:45,596 A:middle
For today, I would just
like to talk specifically

680
00:29:45,596 --> 00:29:49,206 A:middle
about something that I
see in games all the time:

681
00:29:50,236 --> 00:29:52,516 A:middle
the giant bouncing arrow.

682
00:29:54,936 --> 00:29:58,506 A:middle
Now at first, this does
seem like an effective way

683
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:00,396 A:middle
to get people through
a tutorial level.

684

685
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

686
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:00,396 A:middle
to get people through
a tutorial level.

687
00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:06,406 A:middle
Great. But then, you know,
while it starts to show people

688
00:30:06,406 --> 00:30:10,306 A:middle
where to look, it eventually
becomes distracting.

689
00:30:11,006 --> 00:30:13,476 A:middle
When there's more information on
the screen, you're not looking

690
00:30:13,476 --> 00:30:16,646 A:middle
at the information, you're just
looking at the arrow and where

691
00:30:16,646 --> 00:30:18,906 A:middle
to tap and thinking, "I
want to play the game.

692
00:30:18,906 --> 00:30:20,246 A:middle
I don't want to read
the tutorial."

693
00:30:20,796 --> 00:30:24,236 A:middle
So you're looking at this
button instead of looking

694
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:27,136 A:middle
at what the different characters
are going to do for you.

695
00:30:27,136 --> 00:30:28,156 A:middle
Why you're picking them.

696
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,806 A:middle
The strategy of a game, or how
much it's going to cost you

697
00:30:31,806 --> 00:30:33,396 A:middle
or what the reward
is going to be.

698
00:30:34,076 --> 00:30:37,966 A:middle
So pretty soon, your game
has gone from, you know,

699
00:30:37,966 --> 00:30:41,866 A:middle
"happy ice cream fun time" or
whatever to "tap the arrow."

700
00:30:42,766 --> 00:30:44,446 A:middle
No one wants to play
tap the arrow.

701
00:30:44,596 --> 00:30:45,826 A:middle
That's not a fun game.

702
00:30:46,076 --> 00:30:49,336 A:middle
Tap the arrow gets
old so quickly.

703
00:30:50,426 --> 00:30:51,476 A:middle
Another way you can
kind of think

704
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:53,386 A:middle
of it is I don't know
how many of you have pets

705
00:30:53,386 --> 00:30:55,816 A:middle
but if you've ever tried to
point something out to a dog

706
00:30:55,816 --> 00:30:59,106 A:middle
or a cat, they often
just wind up looking

707
00:30:59,106 --> 00:31:00,206 A:middle
at your finger, right?

708

709
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

710
00:30:59,106 --> 00:31:00,206 A:middle
at your finger, right?

711
00:31:01,516 --> 00:31:03,796 A:middle
[ Applause ]

712
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:10,676 A:middle
Yea. So this is exactly what
you're doing with tap the arrow.

713
00:31:11,076 --> 00:31:12,526 A:middle
People aren't going
to be looking

714
00:31:12,526 --> 00:31:14,046 A:middle
at what you're pointing
towards, they're going

715
00:31:14,046 --> 00:31:15,256 A:middle
to be looking at the arrow.

716
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:20,496 A:middle
So rather than pointing,
try a suggestive animation,

717
00:31:20,496 --> 00:31:23,056 A:middle
one that's going to help lead
people's eye to the right part

718
00:31:23,056 --> 00:31:25,206 A:middle
of the screen or let them
know what they should do.

719
00:31:25,206 --> 00:31:28,476 A:middle
This is a really basic
example but it's a good one.

720
00:31:28,836 --> 00:31:33,076 A:middle
With "Hitman GO," you don't
need an arrow or a graphic

721
00:31:33,076 --> 00:31:35,966 A:middle
or some other kind of bouncy
arrow thing to let you know

722
00:31:35,966 --> 00:31:38,536 A:middle
that this is a button in
addition to being the name.

723
00:31:39,116 --> 00:31:41,556 A:middle
That pulsing animation
draws you to it.

724
00:31:41,556 --> 00:31:43,026 A:middle
It makes you want
to tap it, right?

725
00:31:44,076 --> 00:31:47,126 A:middle
I mean, they could have had
an arrow pointing, "Tap here,

726
00:31:47,126 --> 00:31:51,886 A:middle
tap here," but you
don't need to do that.

727
00:31:51,886 --> 00:31:54,666 A:middle
So that's what I mean about
using animation thoughtfully.

728
00:31:55,506 --> 00:31:58,466 A:middle
I hope I look forward to seeing
far fewer bouncing arrows

729
00:31:58,466 --> 00:31:59,076 A:middle
in the future.

730

731
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

732
00:32:00,696 --> 00:32:03,706 A:middle
Now, if you do need your
onboarding, another thing

733
00:32:04,486 --> 00:32:07,776 A:middle
to keep - be wary of is
there is no need to point

734
00:32:07,776 --> 00:32:09,796 A:middle
out any platform conventions.

735
00:32:10,976 --> 00:32:12,866 A:middle
You only point out
the unconventional

736
00:32:13,576 --> 00:32:15,736 A:middle
because everybody knows
there is another screen

737
00:32:15,736 --> 00:32:17,746 A:middle
of app icons available
in this folder.

738
00:32:18,766 --> 00:32:20,726 A:middle
The paging dots take
care of that for you.

739
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:23,456 A:middle
You don't - you wouldn't need
to put an arrow or some text

740
00:32:23,456 --> 00:32:25,956 A:middle
that says swipe to the
side to see more icons.

741
00:32:26,026 --> 00:32:26,966 A:middle
It would be ridiculous.

742
00:32:28,256 --> 00:32:31,596 A:middle
Similarly, you don't have
to tell people that tab bars

743
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:34,026 A:middle
and toolbars are interactive.

744
00:32:34,276 --> 00:32:35,756 A:middle
They instinctively
look that way.

745
00:32:36,776 --> 00:32:38,716 A:middle
Or that you can swipe
for more content

746
00:32:38,826 --> 00:32:42,266 A:middle
because the content bleeding off
the edge does that job for you.

747
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:46,236 A:middle
And that's really one of
the greatest advantages

748
00:32:46,236 --> 00:32:47,996 A:middle
of using platform conventions.

749
00:32:48,676 --> 00:32:51,566 A:middle
People will just instinctively
know how to interact with them,

750
00:32:52,086 --> 00:32:54,626 A:middle
so you won't need any onboarding
for these type of things.

751
00:32:55,456 --> 00:32:58,476 A:middle
You only want to point out
anything that's distinct

752
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,986 A:middle
and unique and unfamiliar
to your audience.

753

754
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

755
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,986 A:middle
and unique and unfamiliar
to your audience.

756
00:33:02,206 --> 00:33:06,616 A:middle
Now, another thing to be wary
of is forcing people to go

757
00:33:06,616 --> 00:33:09,256 A:middle
down a secondary path that
they may not want to take.

758
00:33:10,096 --> 00:33:12,246 A:middle
So think about a
photo application.

759
00:33:13,376 --> 00:33:15,366 A:middle
I don't want to be
forced to crop an image

760
00:33:15,816 --> 00:33:17,546 A:middle
if I don't think it
needs to be cropped.

761
00:33:18,346 --> 00:33:20,236 A:middle
If I don't want to
apply a photo filter

762
00:33:20,236 --> 00:33:22,616 A:middle
to a photo, I shouldn't have to.

763
00:33:22,846 --> 00:33:25,746 A:middle
This is my app, I want to
do what I want with it.

764
00:33:26,496 --> 00:33:28,976 A:middle
Similarly, with music
applications,

765
00:33:28,976 --> 00:33:32,616 A:middle
it's great to show people how
to make a playlist or a station,

766
00:33:33,146 --> 00:33:36,426 A:middle
but don't make them market a
favorite if it's not a favorite.

767
00:33:36,906 --> 00:33:38,106 A:middle
That's just frustrating.

768
00:33:38,106 --> 00:33:43,056 A:middle
Now, when it comes to
text like I said before,

769
00:33:43,296 --> 00:33:44,976 A:middle
shorter is always better.

770
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:47,686 A:middle
We know that people
are not inclined

771
00:33:47,686 --> 00:33:50,196 A:middle
to read really long
passages unless it's a book,

772
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:55,266 A:middle
so make sure your language
is short and clear.

773
00:33:56,316 --> 00:34:00,096 A:middle
Avoid jargon and acronyms
or insider language

774

775
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

776
00:33:56,316 --> 00:34:00,096 A:middle
Avoid jargon and acronyms
or insider language

777
00:34:00,146 --> 00:34:01,186 A:middle
that may not make sense

778
00:34:01,186 --> 00:34:03,536 A:middle
to someone who's
new to your app, OK?

779
00:34:04,096 --> 00:34:08,436 A:middle
This is my favorite example,
"JUKELY," and they're talking

780
00:34:08,436 --> 00:34:09,775 A:middle
about their notifications.

781
00:34:11,206 --> 00:34:14,426 A:middle
It's so fun, a mixtape
from a stalker.

782
00:34:14,936 --> 00:34:15,886 A:middle
I'm excited.

783
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:22,775 A:middle
I mean, this text is clear,
it's friendly, it's entertaining

784
00:34:22,775 --> 00:34:24,505 A:middle
as well as being educational.

785
00:34:25,076 --> 00:34:27,835 A:middle
So here are some
things you can think

786
00:34:27,835 --> 00:34:29,426 A:middle
about when it comes
to writing your text.

787
00:34:30,295 --> 00:34:31,906 A:middle
Ask yourself these questions.

788
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:35,696 A:middle
Could the text be shorter
or could it be clearer?

789
00:34:36,065 --> 00:34:39,396 A:middle
Will the text make sense
to someone who's new

790
00:34:39,396 --> 00:34:43,025 A:middle
to the application, because
you look at your app all day

791
00:34:43,025 --> 00:34:47,116 A:middle
and all night every day, so you
really need fresh perspective,

792
00:34:47,116 --> 00:34:50,136 A:middle
and what will someone
unfamiliar with your app think?

793
00:34:50,616 --> 00:34:53,866 A:middle
Is the message too complicated?

794
00:34:54,315 --> 00:34:58,596 A:middle
If it is, you can make it
simpler, or maybe you need

795
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,276 A:middle
to change your approach
altogether.

796

797
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

798
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,276 A:middle
to change your approach
altogether.

799
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:05,606 A:middle
Or would images work
better than text?

800
00:35:05,746 --> 00:35:08,526 A:middle
There's our phrase, "A picture
is worth a thousand words."

801
00:35:09,376 --> 00:35:12,006 A:middle
Sometimes, it's just easier
to do it with a drawing,

802
00:35:12,586 --> 00:35:13,796 A:middle
like with "Leo's Fortune."

803
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:17,746 A:middle
That little chalk drawing
is much - is a quick read.

804
00:35:17,746 --> 00:35:22,446 A:middle
You can hop up and go on your
way as opposed to saying, "OK.

805
00:35:22,446 --> 00:35:24,586 A:middle
When you get here,
lift your thumb up so

806
00:35:24,586 --> 00:35:26,306 A:middle
that Leo will hop
over the ledge."

807
00:35:26,836 --> 00:35:27,936 A:middle
That would be ridiculous.

808
00:35:30,056 --> 00:35:32,676 A:middle
And make sure that it feels
like an extension of your brand,

809
00:35:33,176 --> 00:35:36,306 A:middle
because onboarding is going
to be the first experience

810
00:35:36,306 --> 00:35:38,196 A:middle
that somebody has
with your app or game.

811
00:35:38,546 --> 00:35:40,566 A:middle
It's kind of like a
wedding invitation

812
00:35:40,566 --> 00:35:41,926 A:middle
or a party invitation.

813
00:35:42,196 --> 00:35:45,346 A:middle
It's going to set the tone
for the entire experience,

814
00:35:45,756 --> 00:35:48,716 A:middle
so make sure it feels
exactly like your brand,

815
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:52,996 A:middle
like the personality
of your app.

816
00:35:53,246 --> 00:35:56,056 A:middle
And this is a very
important one:

817
00:35:56,906 --> 00:35:59,396 A:middle
Always give people
an option to skip.

818

819
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

820
00:36:00,096 --> 00:36:04,146 A:middle
Always. If you saw the lunchtime
session yesterday, Natalia talks

821
00:36:04,146 --> 00:36:06,486 A:middle
about the dark days
of the interwebs

822
00:36:06,886 --> 00:36:10,456 A:middle
with the big crazy flash intros,
and all people wanted was

823
00:36:10,556 --> 00:36:12,016 A:middle
"skip intro, skip intro."

824
00:36:12,016 --> 00:36:14,766 A:middle
And that's exactly what
we're talking about here.

825
00:36:15,486 --> 00:36:19,516 A:middle
You don't know if someone has
used your app on another device,

826
00:36:19,996 --> 00:36:23,236 A:middle
if they watched their friend
use your app, or quite frankly,

827
00:36:23,236 --> 00:36:25,186 A:middle
if they're just impatient
and want to get going.

828
00:36:26,286 --> 00:36:28,806 A:middle
If people don't want to watch
your onboarding no matter how

829
00:36:28,806 --> 00:36:32,106 A:middle
awesome it is, don't make them.

830
00:36:32,246 --> 00:36:35,556 A:middle
And finally, learning should
be an enjoyable experience.

831
00:36:36,576 --> 00:36:37,566 A:middle
It's going to be pleasant.

832
00:36:37,756 --> 00:36:41,496 A:middle
Again, it's your first
impression of the app

833
00:36:41,496 --> 00:36:45,306 A:middle
or the game, so you want to
make sure that it's a good one.

834
00:36:46,546 --> 00:36:47,716 A:middle
Let's take a look at "Flight,"

835
00:36:48,216 --> 00:36:51,256 A:middle
which I think they have a really
great onboarding experience.

836
00:36:51,256 --> 00:36:53,876 A:middle
That Close button up there
is your option to skip.

837
00:36:53,876 --> 00:36:56,776 A:middle
And the UI is based
solely on gestures,

838
00:36:56,776 --> 00:36:58,486 A:middle
and so that's why they
wanted to give some -

839
00:36:58,546 --> 00:37:00,876 A:middle
just a very brief
onboarding explanation.

840

841
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

842
00:36:58,546 --> 00:37:00,876 A:middle
just a very brief
onboarding explanation.

843
00:37:01,966 --> 00:37:05,236 A:middle
The text invokes
the joy of travel.

844
00:37:06,376 --> 00:37:08,056 A:middle
It's just a few short screens.

845
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:15,766 A:middle
The visual design matches
every other aspect of the app.

846
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:18,176 A:middle
And when you're all done,
you tap "Ready to fly,"

847
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:21,166 A:middle
and you get a nice
little animation.

848
00:37:21,356 --> 00:37:21,986 A:middle
Fun, right?

849
00:37:22,216 --> 00:37:26,656 A:middle
Enjoyable, short and pleasant.

850
00:37:26,696 --> 00:37:29,206 A:middle
So make sure if you need
to provide onboarding

851
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:30,716 A:middle
that you're doing
in a way that's fun.

852
00:37:30,906 --> 00:37:33,116 A:middle
Nobody likes a long
boring lecture.

853
00:37:33,756 --> 00:37:36,816 A:middle
So these are the things
that you need to strive

854
00:37:36,816 --> 00:37:41,116 A:middle
for if you need onboarding
- if you need onboarding.

855
00:37:41,656 --> 00:37:45,126 A:middle
Now, whether or not you
have an app or a game,

856
00:37:45,426 --> 00:37:48,456 A:middle
one thing that's always a
challenge is how to teach people

857
00:37:48,456 --> 00:37:51,556 A:middle
about gestures or
gyroscope enhancements,

858
00:37:52,176 --> 00:37:53,536 A:middle
anything that doesn't
have some sort

859
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:56,126 A:middle
of visual representation
in the UI.

860
00:37:57,096 --> 00:37:59,896 A:middle
So let me give you
a few tips about how

861

862
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

863
00:38:00,006 --> 00:38:01,596 A:middle
to make the invisible visible.

864
00:38:03,086 --> 00:38:05,916 A:middle
And the first one is
using animation cues.

865
00:38:06,486 --> 00:38:08,916 A:middle
Now I know none of you are going
to make a big bouncy arrow,

866
00:38:09,826 --> 00:38:11,976 A:middle
but there's a lot of
things that you can do

867
00:38:11,976 --> 00:38:14,706 A:middle
to convey the interactivity
or the gestures

868
00:38:14,816 --> 00:38:15,916 A:middle
in a very elegant way.

869
00:38:17,056 --> 00:38:21,416 A:middle
You'll keep people focused
on the UI, not on the cues.

870
00:38:22,336 --> 00:38:23,536 A:middle
This is "JETSETTER."

871
00:38:23,906 --> 00:38:27,786 A:middle
It's an app that specializes
in luxury hotels and resorts.

872
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:31,386 A:middle
And they've got tons of amazing
photography, which is one

873
00:38:31,386 --> 00:38:33,546 A:middle
of the things that sets them
apart from their competitors.

874
00:38:35,596 --> 00:38:38,876 A:middle
This gentle drift of
the photo lets you know

875
00:38:39,186 --> 00:38:41,536 A:middle
that it's interactive,
that you can touch it

876
00:38:41,536 --> 00:38:45,816 A:middle
and explore different aspects
of this stunning kitchen.

877
00:38:47,006 --> 00:38:51,986 A:middle
It invites you to touch it.

878
00:38:52,176 --> 00:38:55,646 A:middle
Now, the Withings health tracker
app uses horizontal movement

879
00:38:55,646 --> 00:38:57,466 A:middle
to show that the
screens are swipable.

880
00:38:58,156 --> 00:39:02,606 A:middle
So that - and if you don't
swipe it, it will auto-advance.

881

882
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

883
00:38:58,156 --> 00:39:02,606 A:middle
So that - and if you don't
swipe it, it will auto-advance.

884
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:06,856 A:middle
And they've got a nice rewind
page flip type of animation

885
00:39:06,856 --> 00:39:09,016 A:middle
at the end so that you know
you've hit the last item,

886
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:11,306 A:middle
and then you can flip
through for anything you might

887
00:39:11,306 --> 00:39:11,716 A:middle
have missed.

888
00:39:12,246 --> 00:39:17,676 A:middle
And those are just some of the
ways that you can use animation

889
00:39:17,926 --> 00:39:21,016 A:middle
to really help encourage
people or explain gestures

890
00:39:21,016 --> 00:39:22,316 A:middle
or other aspects of the UI.

891
00:39:22,316 --> 00:39:25,736 A:middle
And again, there were
a lot of tips on this

892
00:39:25,736 --> 00:39:27,966 A:middle
in Tuesday's session,
so make sure to check it

893
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:31,796 A:middle
out if you didn't
already see it.

894
00:39:32,056 --> 00:39:35,006 A:middle
Now, another effective teaching
tool is temporary hints.

895
00:39:35,446 --> 00:39:37,486 A:middle
Just really quick
tips about gestures.

896
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,416 A:middle
This is "Yahoo!

897
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:42,346 A:middle
News Digest" again, and
as I showed earlier,

898
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:44,476 A:middle
their onboarding is all
about the core concept.

899
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:48,606 A:middle
So instead, once you get
into the UI, they don't need

900
00:39:48,606 --> 00:39:51,456 A:middle
to tell you about
that ahead of time,

901
00:39:51,796 --> 00:39:53,026 A:middle
but they give you just a couple

902
00:39:53,026 --> 00:39:55,196 A:middle
of animation cues
and temporary hints.

903
00:39:56,006 --> 00:39:59,346 A:middle
So tapping on an article
headline has a horizontal

904
00:39:59,346 --> 00:40:04,976 A:middle
animation and then that
short message about swiping.

905

906
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

907
00:39:59,346 --> 00:40:04,976 A:middle
animation and then that
short message about swiping.

908
00:40:05,086 --> 00:40:08,096 A:middle
So if the horizontal
animation didn't do it for you,

909
00:40:08,096 --> 00:40:10,916 A:middle
this message, which only
appears for two seconds,

910
00:40:11,146 --> 00:40:13,356 A:middle
makes it abundantly
clear that you can swipe

911
00:40:13,356 --> 00:40:14,456 A:middle
from article to article.

912
00:40:14,926 --> 00:40:17,816 A:middle
And you'll notice, they
didn't force you to swipe.

913
00:40:18,446 --> 00:40:20,746 A:middle
Because I might be interested
in reading this article.

914
00:40:20,796 --> 00:40:26,096 A:middle
They just want to make sure
you know how to navigate.

915
00:40:26,146 --> 00:40:28,166 A:middle
"Lightly" has a different
approach.

916
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,456 A:middle
It's a photo editing
application,

917
00:40:30,456 --> 00:40:33,606 A:middle
and the first time you use
it, they give you hints

918
00:40:33,606 --> 00:40:35,236 A:middle
about gestures with short tips.

919
00:40:36,036 --> 00:40:39,736 A:middle
So here, I've just selected the
Argyle filter, and so what comes

920
00:40:39,736 --> 00:40:42,486 A:middle
up is a message about
adjusting the intensity.

921
00:40:43,246 --> 00:40:47,256 A:middle
Now, I just want to point out,
they don't actually force you

922
00:40:47,256 --> 00:40:48,536 A:middle
to adjust the intensity.

923
00:40:49,216 --> 00:40:52,496 A:middle
Any other - any place that you
tap will dismiss that hint,

924
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:55,856 A:middle
whether it's adjusting
the intensity,

925
00:40:55,856 --> 00:40:58,556 A:middle
picking another filter from
the bottom or using any

926
00:40:58,556 --> 00:40:59,326 A:middle
of the other controls.

927
00:40:59,836 --> 00:41:05,006 A:middle
So in addition to
displaying temporary hints,

928

929
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

930
00:40:59,836 --> 00:41:05,006 A:middle
So in addition to
displaying temporary hints,

931
00:41:05,366 --> 00:41:08,746 A:middle
you can also think about
providing controls for people

932
00:41:08,746 --> 00:41:11,706 A:middle
to turn them on, and
this is what we do

933
00:41:11,706 --> 00:41:13,366 A:middle
in "GarageBand" on iOS.

934
00:41:14,216 --> 00:41:16,736 A:middle
Now, this is something
that's more appropriate

935
00:41:16,736 --> 00:41:18,266 A:middle
for deeper applications.

936
00:41:18,646 --> 00:41:20,706 A:middle
Not every app warrants this.

937
00:41:21,626 --> 00:41:23,996 A:middle
And you can come in and just
start playing these drums

938
00:41:23,996 --> 00:41:26,376 A:middle
and going nuts without
any assistance at all,

939
00:41:27,016 --> 00:41:29,776 A:middle
but if you want to know
more, get a deeper knowledge

940
00:41:29,776 --> 00:41:33,576 A:middle
about drumming, because it's
sort of a specialty case.

941
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:35,416 A:middle
If you want to become
a better musician,

942
00:41:36,206 --> 00:41:40,606 A:middle
then using that question mark
button up in the corner turns

943
00:41:40,606 --> 00:41:43,006 A:middle
on these non-modal tips,

944
00:41:43,186 --> 00:41:48,436 A:middle
so you can keep playing the
drums while you're reading more

945
00:41:48,436 --> 00:41:48,966 A:middle
about them.

946
00:41:49,816 --> 00:41:52,466 A:middle
And without those non-modal
tips - without these tips,

947
00:41:52,466 --> 00:41:54,996 A:middle
you might not realize that
you can get different sounds

948
00:41:54,996 --> 00:41:59,616 A:middle
out of the hi-hat based on where
it is that you're tapping it,

949
00:41:59,616 --> 00:42:02,256 A:middle
or that a single tap will
play the crash cymbal

950

951
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

952
00:41:59,616 --> 00:42:02,256 A:middle
or that a single tap will
play the crash cymbal

953
00:42:02,346 --> 00:42:06,326 A:middle
and the bass drum together, but
a two-finger tap is what results

954
00:42:06,636 --> 00:42:07,926 A:middle
in just the crash cymbal.

955
00:42:08,536 --> 00:42:11,076 A:middle
Or you wouldn't know
that the speed

956
00:42:11,076 --> 00:42:13,306 A:middle
of the drum repeat is
determined by the distance

957
00:42:13,306 --> 00:42:14,436 A:middle
between your two fingers.

958
00:42:14,716 --> 00:42:15,776 A:middle
All really useful.

959
00:42:15,856 --> 00:42:19,116 A:middle
So if you think you
have an audience

960
00:42:19,116 --> 00:42:21,996 A:middle
that wants a deeper knowledge
or needs extra guidance

961
00:42:21,996 --> 00:42:27,426 A:middle
on a specialized subject,
this could be a good method.

962
00:42:27,426 --> 00:42:30,766 A:middle
And it's really important that
you can continue to use the app

963
00:42:31,076 --> 00:42:32,686 A:middle
so that you can learn by doing.

964
00:42:33,896 --> 00:42:38,996 A:middle
You can put it into
practice right on the spot.

965
00:42:38,996 --> 00:42:41,416 A:middle
Because all of these
approaches work best

966
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:42,856 A:middle
if they're shown in context.

967
00:42:43,426 --> 00:42:46,016 A:middle
It's important that when
you're demonstrating gestures,

968
00:42:46,266 --> 00:42:47,706 A:middle
you want to do it
right in the moment

969
00:42:47,706 --> 00:42:50,136 A:middle
when people can experiment
with them

970
00:42:50,136 --> 00:42:51,446 A:middle
so that they're learning
by doing.

971
00:42:52,266 --> 00:42:57,356 A:middle
So now, I would like to address
a dirty word in iOS UI design.

972
00:42:58,806 --> 00:43:00,726 A:middle
Help. Help.

973

974
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

975
00:42:58,806 --> 00:43:00,726 A:middle
Help. Help.

976
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:04,376 A:middle
Nobody wants to think
they need help,

977
00:43:04,376 --> 00:43:05,906 A:middle
or nobody wants to ask for help.

978
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:10,906 A:middle
And as a designer, I certainly
hope that every aspect

979
00:43:10,906 --> 00:43:14,566 A:middle
of my UI is intuitive
to use to every person

980
00:43:14,986 --> 00:43:17,796 A:middle
in every scenario no
matter what their needs.

981
00:43:18,286 --> 00:43:22,096 A:middle
But sometimes, this
is hard to achieve.

982
00:43:23,486 --> 00:43:25,936 A:middle
I mean, people have
different experiences,

983
00:43:26,126 --> 00:43:27,096 A:middle
different backgrounds.

984
00:43:27,726 --> 00:43:28,996 A:middle
They come from different
cultures.

985
00:43:29,586 --> 00:43:31,316 A:middle
They may have a lot
of experience

986
00:43:31,316 --> 00:43:35,756 A:middle
with the Apple platform but not
with iOS or specialty knowledge.

987
00:43:36,316 --> 00:43:38,836 A:middle
Like, I can navigate
around just about any app

988
00:43:39,146 --> 00:43:42,146 A:middle
on the Apple platform but
I'm not a good photographer.

989
00:43:42,616 --> 00:43:44,826 A:middle
So all those filters
and photo effects,

990
00:43:44,826 --> 00:43:47,126 A:middle
I don't know what
to do with them.

991
00:43:47,176 --> 00:43:49,256 A:middle
I don't know when I should
use them, how they're going

992
00:43:49,256 --> 00:43:50,526 A:middle
to make my pictures better.

993
00:43:50,526 --> 00:43:54,166 A:middle
And that's where help
can be very handy.

994
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:58,576 A:middle
But it's not so as to feel like
a lecture from a mean teacher.

995
00:43:59,376 --> 00:44:02,146 A:middle
Or boring.

996

997
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

998
00:43:59,376 --> 00:44:02,146 A:middle
Or boring.

999
00:44:02,426 --> 00:44:03,676 A:middle
Nobody wants boring.

1000
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:07,486 A:middle
We're moving away from that
large reference manual, right?

1001
00:44:08,426 --> 00:44:09,506 A:middle
It should feel more like this.

1002
00:44:10,296 --> 00:44:12,716 A:middle
Just making things a
little bit easier on people.

1003
00:44:13,506 --> 00:44:17,196 A:middle
Or maybe like support from
a friend or a family member,

1004
00:44:17,236 --> 00:44:18,386 A:middle
just giving you a
couple of tips,

1005
00:44:19,446 --> 00:44:21,166 A:middle
because I'm definitely
not suggesting

1006
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:24,906 A:middle
that you add a huge reference
document to your app.

1007
00:44:24,956 --> 00:44:27,596 A:middle
There are a lot of ways
that you can provide help

1008
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:30,226 A:middle
without people even
realizing that they got any.

1009
00:44:30,226 --> 00:44:34,816 A:middle
One of the easiest
things that you can do is

1010
00:44:34,816 --> 00:44:37,296 A:middle
to put instructions in
your empty containers.

1011
00:44:38,136 --> 00:44:42,296 A:middle
Rather than just saying "no
results for search" or "nothing

1012
00:44:42,296 --> 00:44:45,206 A:middle
to see here," you want
to keep an empty view

1013
00:44:45,206 --> 00:44:46,276 A:middle
from being a dead end.

1014
00:44:46,786 --> 00:44:51,316 A:middle
If it all possible, let people
know what to expect here or how

1015
00:44:51,316 --> 00:44:53,206 A:middle
to get out of this
dead-end situation.

1016
00:44:54,876 --> 00:44:57,986 A:middle
So in iMovie for iOS,
there is a theater view

1017
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:02,256 A:middle
where your completed projects
go so you can view them.

1018

1019
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1020
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:02,256 A:middle
where your completed projects
go so you can view them.

1021
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:04,486 A:middle
Now, before you create
any projects,

1022
00:45:04,486 --> 00:45:05,756 A:middle
there is nothing to show here.

1023
00:45:06,126 --> 00:45:08,776 A:middle
So the message lets you know
exactly what you're going

1024
00:45:08,776 --> 00:45:12,356 A:middle
to find here in the future,
and then they tell you how

1025
00:45:12,356 --> 00:45:13,686 A:middle
to get started making
a product -

1026
00:45:13,726 --> 00:45:17,076 A:middle
project so that you can have
a movie here really quickly.

1027
00:45:17,696 --> 00:45:21,166 A:middle
And it's worth pointing out that
both the message and the icon

1028
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:22,766 A:middle
in the navigation
are interactive,

1029
00:45:22,766 --> 00:45:25,886 A:middle
so you can get going quickly
while you're learning the UI.

1030
00:45:26,896 --> 00:45:31,886 A:middle
And this same approach can work
for empty input fields too.

1031
00:45:32,406 --> 00:45:34,786 A:middle
Placeholder text can
be super informative.

1032
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:39,786 A:middle
This is "UpTo," which
is a calendar app.

1033
00:45:40,396 --> 00:45:42,366 A:middle
You can of course manage
your own appointments,

1034
00:45:42,366 --> 00:45:44,876 A:middle
but one of the things
that's cool about "UpTo" is

1035
00:45:44,876 --> 00:45:47,626 A:middle
that you can also subscribe
to other people's calendars,

1036
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:50,186 A:middle
and the other people
can be your friends,

1037
00:45:50,756 --> 00:45:52,136 A:middle
or it can be Barack Obama.

1038
00:45:52,776 --> 00:45:55,256 A:middle
And they have tons of
calendars available in here

1039
00:45:55,356 --> 00:45:57,436 A:middle
so you can browse to
find the ones you want,

1040
00:45:57,706 --> 00:45:59,126 A:middle
but you can also search,

1041
00:45:59,816 --> 00:46:04,196 A:middle
and that Search text is very
suggestive in terms of the type

1042

1043
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1044
00:45:59,816 --> 00:46:04,196 A:middle
and that Search text is very
suggestive in terms of the type

1045
00:46:04,196 --> 00:46:06,046 A:middle
of things that you might
want to put in there.

1046
00:46:06,616 --> 00:46:09,496 A:middle
Now, I got the impression from
the graphic that I could search

1047
00:46:09,496 --> 00:46:12,956 A:middle
for sports teams, but I didn't
realize I could just type

1048
00:46:12,956 --> 00:46:16,966 A:middle
in San Francisco and see all
the listings for San Francisco.

1049
00:46:18,196 --> 00:46:23,046 A:middle
It's very helpful, and it
didn't feel like help, right?

1050
00:46:23,236 --> 00:46:26,206 A:middle
I didn't even realize
I needed any help,

1051
00:46:26,246 --> 00:46:27,606 A:middle
but yet I've learned
something new.

1052
00:46:28,096 --> 00:46:33,476 A:middle
You can also think about showing
supporting information right

1053
00:46:33,476 --> 00:46:38,166 A:middle
inline, and we do this with
settings - not all settings

1054
00:46:38,356 --> 00:46:39,406 A:middle
because they don't all need it.

1055
00:46:40,206 --> 00:46:42,736 A:middle
Date & Time is a pretty
universal concept;

1056
00:46:42,736 --> 00:46:44,226 A:middle
there is nothing
else to say here.

1057
00:46:45,406 --> 00:46:46,986 A:middle
The Dial Assist, well,

1058
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:50,576 A:middle
some people might have some
questions about what that is.

1059
00:46:50,936 --> 00:46:52,286 A:middle
So there's just a little bit

1060
00:46:52,286 --> 00:46:54,596 A:middle
of more information
right in that moment.

1061
00:46:55,636 --> 00:46:58,126 A:middle
Again, it didn't feel like help.

1062
00:46:59,246 --> 00:47:01,296 A:middle
And with games, "Leo's Fortune."

1063

1064
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1065
00:46:59,246 --> 00:47:01,296 A:middle
And with games, "Leo's Fortune."

1066
00:47:01,426 --> 00:47:03,416 A:middle
That chalk drawing is
giving you that little hint.

1067
00:47:04,586 --> 00:47:06,796 A:middle
And they don't just do this
in the tutorial level -

1068
00:47:06,796 --> 00:47:10,046 A:middle
it's throughout the game.

1069
00:47:10,236 --> 00:47:13,496 A:middle
In fact, showing information
inline is often a great

1070
00:47:13,496 --> 00:47:15,656 A:middle
alternative to onboarding
altogether.

1071
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:17,986 A:middle
You don't have to tell
everything up front.

1072
00:47:18,576 --> 00:47:22,496 A:middle
Just put the extra information
inline so it's there right

1073
00:47:22,496 --> 00:47:24,606 A:middle
in that moment that
people need it.

1074
00:47:26,846 --> 00:47:29,836 A:middle
Now, another great approach
is to watch for indications

1075
00:47:29,836 --> 00:47:31,866 A:middle
that people are stuck.

1076
00:47:32,856 --> 00:47:35,436 A:middle
Now, when it comes to games,
though, you have to be wary

1077
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:37,796 A:middle
about over-helping people
because it's a game,

1078
00:47:38,526 --> 00:47:41,126 A:middle
nobody enjoys having the
puzzle solved for them.

1079
00:47:41,236 --> 00:47:42,076 A:middle
That's not fun.

1080
00:47:42,886 --> 00:47:45,806 A:middle
You want to give people a
chance to play all on their own

1081
00:47:45,876 --> 00:47:47,906 A:middle
and then watch for clues
they might be stuck.

1082
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:52,636 A:middle
And that's when you
offer the help.

1083
00:47:52,816 --> 00:47:56,136 A:middle
With "Leo's Fortune," if you
try a number of times to get

1084
00:47:56,136 --> 00:47:58,716 A:middle
over this very basic obstacle
and you don't make it,

1085

1086
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1087
00:48:00,016 --> 00:48:02,046 A:middle
they give you the option
of onscreen controls.

1088
00:48:02,886 --> 00:48:05,076 A:middle
Again, they only
do this if it looks

1089
00:48:05,076 --> 00:48:07,666 A:middle
like you're struggling
with that first jump.

1090
00:48:09,116 --> 00:48:11,166 A:middle
"The Room Two" also
has a great approach.

1091
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:15,716 A:middle
Now, if you haven't played it,
it's a mystery puzzler game.

1092
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,816 A:middle
You're stuck in this room and
you follow clue, after clue,

1093
00:48:18,816 --> 00:48:20,616 A:middle
after clue to make your escape.

1094
00:48:21,266 --> 00:48:23,386 A:middle
Now, if you've been
struggling for a long time,

1095
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:26,556 A:middle
and you still didn't manage
to accomplish the next thing,

1096
00:48:27,426 --> 00:48:29,196 A:middle
they give you this
question mark button.

1097
00:48:29,736 --> 00:48:35,986 A:middle
And this is great because it's
giving you the option of a hint.

1098
00:48:36,166 --> 00:48:37,676 A:middle
Because it's true,
I might be stuck,

1099
00:48:38,876 --> 00:48:40,606 A:middle
or I may have been distracted.

1100
00:48:41,856 --> 00:48:44,626 A:middle
My dog may have started barking,
or someone needed something

1101
00:48:44,626 --> 00:48:45,806 A:middle
and walked into the room.

1102
00:48:46,386 --> 00:48:49,186 A:middle
So that's really good because
they're not solving the puzzle

1103
00:48:49,256 --> 00:48:50,406 A:middle
for me.

1104
00:48:51,536 --> 00:48:55,316 A:middle
However, if I am really
stuck and I'm at the point

1105
00:48:55,316 --> 00:48:57,556 A:middle
of walking away, it's
enough to keep me engaged,

1106
00:48:57,556 --> 00:48:58,716 A:middle
to keep me moving forward.

1107
00:48:59,276 --> 00:49:03,126 A:middle
And instead of giving away the
answers, they give you clues

1108

1109
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1110
00:48:59,276 --> 00:49:03,126 A:middle
And instead of giving away the
answers, they give you clues

1111
00:49:03,126 --> 00:49:04,996 A:middle
so you don't have
to feel guilty.

1112
00:49:04,996 --> 00:49:06,516 A:middle
It doesn't have to
feel like cheating.

1113
00:49:06,596 --> 00:49:08,526 A:middle
You don't have to feel
bad about it, right?

1114
00:49:08,526 --> 00:49:11,936 A:middle
And this doesn't devalue
the achievements of people

1115
00:49:11,936 --> 00:49:12,956 A:middle
who didn't use the clues.

1116
00:49:13,496 --> 00:49:14,676 A:middle
We're all going to
get to the end.

1117
00:49:15,826 --> 00:49:17,836 A:middle
Some of us are going
to get there faster,

1118
00:49:18,186 --> 00:49:19,496 A:middle
but this works out really well.

1119
00:49:19,496 --> 00:49:22,066 A:middle
Everyone can feel really good
when they finish the game.

1120
00:49:22,696 --> 00:49:26,706 A:middle
And these kind of hints can
be helpful with apps too.

1121
00:49:27,646 --> 00:49:29,376 A:middle
This is "Sky Guide," another one

1122
00:49:29,376 --> 00:49:31,556 A:middle
of this year's Apple
Design Award winners.

1123
00:49:32,516 --> 00:49:35,926 A:middle
You can pan all around the sky
and see the constellations,

1124
00:49:36,286 --> 00:49:40,906 A:middle
planets, comets, all sorts
of stars, and they have a ton

1125
00:49:40,906 --> 00:49:45,166 A:middle
of information about almost
anything in the night sky.

1126
00:49:46,496 --> 00:49:48,786 A:middle
Now, you might think that
tapping on a star is the way

1127
00:49:48,786 --> 00:49:50,046 A:middle
to get that information,

1128
00:49:50,046 --> 00:49:53,046 A:middle
but that would make it a
little too easy to navigate

1129
00:49:53,046 --> 00:49:55,206 A:middle
into the details view
- if you're going there

1130
00:49:55,206 --> 00:49:57,356 A:middle
on accident then you'd
be getting frustrated.

1131
00:49:58,226 --> 00:50:03,116 A:middle
So instead, the right way to
get to that information is

1132

1133
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1134
00:49:58,226 --> 00:50:03,116 A:middle
So instead, the right way to
get to that information is

1135
00:50:03,116 --> 00:50:06,006 A:middle
by selecting a star and
then tapping that "i" button

1136
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:07,306 A:middle
on the right side of the screen.

1137
00:50:07,876 --> 00:50:13,476 A:middle
And if you tap a star
again to try and select it

1138
00:50:13,476 --> 00:50:16,346 A:middle
or get more information,
you get a pulsing animation,

1139
00:50:16,466 --> 00:50:19,296 A:middle
and that glow calls
attention to itself.

1140
00:50:20,436 --> 00:50:22,756 A:middle
They're using animation
to attract your attention.

1141
00:50:22,756 --> 00:50:25,376 A:middle
And that's really elegant

1142
00:50:25,496 --> 00:50:28,526 A:middle
because if you double-tap
a star thinking oh,

1143
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:31,406 A:middle
maybe I didn't tap hard enough
or maybe I need to tap twice,

1144
00:50:31,866 --> 00:50:35,036 A:middle
they pulse every time you
tap, to get your attention.

1145
00:50:35,796 --> 00:50:39,586 A:middle
So they're keeping an eye
out for you that you're stuck

1146
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,866 A:middle
and trying to pull you
in the right direction,

1147
00:50:42,236 --> 00:50:45,546 A:middle
get you back on track.

1148
00:50:45,546 --> 00:50:48,046 A:middle
And all of these tips that
I've shown you are really just

1149
00:50:48,046 --> 00:50:50,006 A:middle
about anticipating
people's needs.

1150
00:50:50,786 --> 00:50:53,546 A:middle
Telling people what they
need to know in the moment

1151
00:50:53,546 --> 00:50:55,376 A:middle
that they need to know it.

1152
00:50:55,516 --> 00:50:59,206 A:middle
Think about the restaurant again
that I talked about earlier.

1153
00:50:59,966 --> 00:51:02,106 A:middle
You don't want to see the
dessert menu before you've been

1154

1155
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1156
00:50:59,966 --> 00:51:02,106 A:middle
You don't want to see the
dessert menu before you've been

1157
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:04,856 A:middle
seated or while you're
eating your appetizer.

1158
00:51:05,136 --> 00:51:06,596 A:middle
You want it when you
finish your meal.

1159
00:51:07,256 --> 00:51:10,696 A:middle
And when you have good
service at a restaurant,

1160
00:51:10,696 --> 00:51:13,126 A:middle
it means the wait staff is
there when you need them,

1161
00:51:13,376 --> 00:51:14,836 A:middle
and they're not there
when you don't.

1162
00:51:16,166 --> 00:51:18,816 A:middle
And that's exactly the
approach you want to take

1163
00:51:18,816 --> 00:51:20,816 A:middle
if you've got help inside
of your application.

1164
00:51:22,436 --> 00:51:24,726 A:middle
And "Secret" is really
one of the best examples

1165
00:51:24,726 --> 00:51:26,016 A:middle
that I've seen out there.

1166
00:51:26,596 --> 00:51:28,606 A:middle
It's an anonymous
social networking app.

1167
00:51:28,916 --> 00:51:31,616 A:middle
So what this means is that you
see posts from your friends,

1168
00:51:31,616 --> 00:51:33,996 A:middle
but you don't know who they are
because everything is anonymous.

1169
00:51:34,806 --> 00:51:37,406 A:middle
That's a really interesting
way to interact with people.

1170
00:51:38,306 --> 00:51:41,896 A:middle
Now, the first time your feed
loads, they're explaining

1171
00:51:41,896 --> 00:51:43,916 A:middle
in a moment exactly
the information

1172
00:51:43,916 --> 00:51:44,656 A:middle
that you need to know.

1173
00:51:46,076 --> 00:51:48,406 A:middle
So here, I'm scrolling
through my feed,

1174
00:51:48,406 --> 00:51:50,736 A:middle
and I don't know
anyone in the UK.

1175
00:51:50,736 --> 00:51:53,436 A:middle
Oh, it's traveled
across friends.

1176
00:51:54,336 --> 00:51:56,426 A:middle
Speaking of friends,
where are my friends?

1177
00:51:57,916 --> 00:52:00,356 A:middle
Oh, I didn't have
my phone number yet.

1178

1179
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1180
00:51:57,916 --> 00:52:00,356 A:middle
Oh, I didn't have
my phone number yet.

1181
00:52:00,946 --> 00:52:04,376 A:middle
Shoot. And what's the
star mean, I wonder?

1182
00:52:05,086 --> 00:52:06,126 A:middle
It's a popular one.

1183
00:52:06,826 --> 00:52:08,066 A:middle
And when you go to Comments,

1184
00:52:09,776 --> 00:52:12,246 A:middle
they explain why there
are all these icons here.

1185
00:52:12,806 --> 00:52:15,536 A:middle
They're just letting you know
about commenting because that's

1186
00:52:15,536 --> 00:52:16,736 A:middle
where you are in the app.

1187
00:52:17,506 --> 00:52:19,206 A:middle
They're not telling
you about navigation

1188
00:52:19,206 --> 00:52:21,206 A:middle
or what does the star mean
and things like that -

1189
00:52:21,206 --> 00:52:22,676 A:middle
they're focused on commenting.

1190
00:52:23,876 --> 00:52:25,906 A:middle
And it's worth noting that
they're just giving one piece

1191
00:52:25,906 --> 00:52:29,586 A:middle
of information at
a time as well.

1192
00:52:29,706 --> 00:52:31,496 A:middle
And if you're the
first to comment,

1193
00:52:31,766 --> 00:52:35,666 A:middle
they've populated their
empty view with information.

1194
00:52:36,036 --> 00:52:37,666 A:middle
You know that comments
are going to be there.

1195
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:40,546 A:middle
This little gentle push
should be the first one,

1196
00:52:41,596 --> 00:52:45,316 A:middle
and I just love that the
placeholder text encourages you

1197
00:52:45,316 --> 00:52:46,816 A:middle
to say something kind.

1198
00:52:47,306 --> 00:52:48,006 A:middle
It's great.

1199
00:52:48,656 --> 00:52:52,886 A:middle
So think about what people need
to know based on where they are

1200
00:52:52,886 --> 00:52:56,276 A:middle
in your app or game, how
long they've been using it,

1201
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:58,786 A:middle
and anticipating people's
needs is just another way

1202
00:52:58,786 --> 00:53:00,416 A:middle
that you're going to
be able to provide help

1203

1204
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1205
00:52:58,786 --> 00:53:00,416 A:middle
that you're going to
be able to provide help

1206
00:53:00,706 --> 00:53:02,376 A:middle
without it feeling like help.

1207
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:08,756 A:middle
And be sure to take the
opportunity to inspire people

1208
00:53:09,066 --> 00:53:11,306 A:middle
like "Secret" did with
"say something kind."

1209
00:53:11,956 --> 00:53:17,246 A:middle
Now, a lot of people use Siri
to set reminders or send text

1210
00:53:17,246 --> 00:53:20,636 A:middle
or check sports scores,
things like that, but remember

1211
00:53:20,636 --> 00:53:22,696 A:middle
when you found out that
Siri would answer questions

1212
00:53:22,696 --> 00:53:24,066 A:middle
like this?

1213
00:53:24,616 --> 00:53:27,736 A:middle
I mean, all of a sudden, this
convenience feature is a source

1214
00:53:27,736 --> 00:53:29,226 A:middle
of entertainment as well.

1215
00:53:30,076 --> 00:53:34,606 A:middle
It's unexpected and fun, and
now Siri is more valuable to me

1216
00:53:35,356 --> 00:53:37,326 A:middle
because she's not just
a utility anymore.

1217
00:53:37,326 --> 00:53:38,286 A:middle
She's comedy.

1218
00:53:38,736 --> 00:53:39,786 A:middle
She's flattery.

1219
00:53:40,126 --> 00:53:40,836 A:middle
It's great.

1220
00:53:42,296 --> 00:53:45,346 A:middle
People might come to your app
with a certain expectation

1221
00:53:46,326 --> 00:53:49,356 A:middle
about getting one thing
done, but when they discover

1222
00:53:49,356 --> 00:53:51,126 A:middle
that your app can
do more for them,

1223
00:53:51,356 --> 00:53:53,926 A:middle
well then the app becomes
even more valuable.

1224
00:53:55,036 --> 00:53:57,806 A:middle
It's going to feel
like a bonus prize.

1225
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:02,416 A:middle
And that's why with Siri, we
give you a lot of suggestions

1226

1227
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1228
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:02,416 A:middle
And that's why with Siri, we
give you a lot of suggestions

1229
00:54:02,416 --> 00:54:03,956 A:middle
of things that you can ask her.

1230
00:54:04,056 --> 00:54:06,546 A:middle
You just tap that question
mark button and you're going

1231
00:54:06,546 --> 00:54:09,456 A:middle
to get a long list of things
that you can ask Siri.

1232
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:13,756 A:middle
And you may have known that you
can use Siri to initiate calls

1233
00:54:13,756 --> 00:54:17,056 A:middle
or have her make an
appointment on your calendar,

1234
00:54:17,056 --> 00:54:20,216 A:middle
but did you know that she also
will book restaurants for you

1235
00:54:20,776 --> 00:54:22,086 A:middle
or tell you movie times?

1236
00:54:22,336 --> 00:54:25,036 A:middle
I mean, this list goes
on, and on and on.

1237
00:54:27,076 --> 00:54:29,376 A:middle
"Path" does it with some
of their onboarding.

1238
00:54:29,836 --> 00:54:32,956 A:middle
And they're a private social
network, so they really need you

1239
00:54:32,956 --> 00:54:35,086 A:middle
to register because
everything is oriented

1240
00:54:35,086 --> 00:54:36,436 A:middle
around your personal
information.

1241
00:54:37,436 --> 00:54:40,736 A:middle
But before registering, they're
giving you a series of screens

1242
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:44,176 A:middle
that covers both the
features of the apps

1243
00:54:44,316 --> 00:54:46,886 A:middle
but also how you might
want to use them.

1244
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:50,616 A:middle
A lot of people go to "Path"
thinking they're going to use it

1245
00:54:50,616 --> 00:54:52,456 A:middle
for work, but now, they're
going to be thinking

1246
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:55,226 A:middle
about how they can use it
in their personal life, too.

1247
00:54:57,516 --> 00:55:01,096 A:middle
Or with Pinterest, they've
got a similar approach.

1248

1249
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1250
00:54:57,516 --> 00:55:01,096 A:middle
Or with Pinterest, they've
got a similar approach.

1251
00:55:01,696 --> 00:55:03,236 A:middle
I mean, maybe you
came to Pinterest

1252
00:55:03,236 --> 00:55:06,296 A:middle
because you were interested
in nail art or wanting recipes

1253
00:55:06,296 --> 00:55:08,706 A:middle
for a dinner party, but
now you're also thinking

1254
00:55:08,706 --> 00:55:09,806 A:middle
about gardening.

1255
00:55:10,806 --> 00:55:11,716 A:middle
And then you're thinking

1256
00:55:11,716 --> 00:55:13,846 A:middle
about what else Pinterest
can be used for.

1257
00:55:14,496 --> 00:55:19,106 A:middle
So step away from that
traditional idea of help,

1258
00:55:19,586 --> 00:55:22,006 A:middle
reference manuals, and think

1259
00:55:22,006 --> 00:55:24,366 A:middle
about how you can
anticipate people's needs.

1260
00:55:25,506 --> 00:55:27,726 A:middle
Putting instructions
in empty containers

1261
00:55:27,726 --> 00:55:30,186 A:middle
and showing supporting
information inline,

1262
00:55:30,706 --> 00:55:33,446 A:middle
it's about telling people what
they need to know in that moment

1263
00:55:33,966 --> 00:55:37,036 A:middle
that they need to know it
- like the perfect service

1264
00:55:37,096 --> 00:55:39,976 A:middle
in a restaurant, there
when you need them

1265
00:55:39,976 --> 00:55:42,956 A:middle
and invisible when you don't.

1266
00:55:43,066 --> 00:55:45,006 A:middle
When you're doing all
of that, don't forget

1267
00:55:45,036 --> 00:55:47,166 A:middle
to take the opportunity
to inspire people,

1268
00:55:47,166 --> 00:55:49,056 A:middle
because that increased
knowledge,

1269
00:55:49,316 --> 00:55:51,286 A:middle
that increased utility
about your app,

1270
00:55:51,286 --> 00:55:53,566 A:middle
it's going to mean
increased value.

1271
00:55:54,376 --> 00:55:59,386 A:middle
So if you only take a few things
away from this talk today,

1272
00:55:59,546 --> 00:56:04,426 A:middle
in summary, only require
people to register

1273

1274
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1275
00:55:59,546 --> 00:56:04,426 A:middle
in summary, only require
people to register

1276
00:56:04,426 --> 00:56:06,416 A:middle
when it's absolutely necessary.

1277
00:56:07,736 --> 00:56:10,426 A:middle
Ask yourselves if you really
need onboarding at all.

1278
00:56:11,106 --> 00:56:13,056 A:middle
If they don't need any
information before getting

1279
00:56:13,056 --> 00:56:15,806 A:middle
started, then just let them
get started, otherwise,

1280
00:56:16,016 --> 00:56:17,496 A:middle
tell them what they need
to know and then get

1281
00:56:17,496 --> 00:56:18,536 A:middle
out of the way quickly.

1282
00:56:19,766 --> 00:56:21,836 A:middle
Teach through actions
because people are going

1283
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:23,066 A:middle
to learn better by doing.

1284
00:56:24,816 --> 00:56:28,306 A:middle
Anticipate people's
needs, and don't forget

1285
00:56:28,306 --> 00:56:30,046 A:middle
to take the opportunity
to inspire.

1286
00:56:31,206 --> 00:56:34,256 A:middle
Now, I hope that you'll leave
today with a new impression

1287
00:56:34,256 --> 00:56:36,886 A:middle
about help and how it can
work in your apps or games

1288
00:56:37,646 --> 00:56:40,166 A:middle
and that I hope that I've
inspired you all with how

1289
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:41,766 A:middle
to make a great first
impression.

1290
00:56:42,586 --> 00:56:46,926 A:middle
So this is my email, and I
would genuinely like to hear

1291
00:56:46,926 --> 00:56:49,326 A:middle
about changes that
you make to your app

1292
00:56:49,326 --> 00:56:51,416 A:middle
and how that's changed
the overall experience.

1293
00:56:52,146 --> 00:56:54,356 A:middle
We've got a lot more
information about design

1294
00:56:54,826 --> 00:56:56,716 A:middle
at the developer.apple.com.

1295
00:56:57,806 --> 00:57:01,056 A:middle

And if you didn't see either of
these two sessions on Tuesday,

1299
00:57:01,056 --> 00:57:02,566 A:middle
the videos are available.

1300
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:04,776 A:middle
We've got the "Ingredients
of Great Games," which is

1301
00:57:04,776 --> 00:57:06,596 A:middle
about making a great game,

1302
00:57:06,706 --> 00:57:10,056 A:middle
and then "Designing Intuitive
User Experiences" has all

1303
00:57:10,056 --> 00:57:11,086 A:middle
of those animation tips.

1304
00:57:11,776 --> 00:57:12,406 A:middle
Thanks so much.
