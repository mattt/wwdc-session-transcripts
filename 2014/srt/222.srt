1
00:00:13,436 --> 00:00:14,656 A:middle
>> Okay. Hello everybody.

2
00:00:14,786 --> 00:00:16,315 A:middle
My name is Dave Wilson.

3
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:18,986 A:middle
I'm on the iAd team and
I'm here to talk to you

4
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:21,556 A:middle
about optimizing your
earning power with iAd.

5
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:25,916 A:middle
For those of you who
don't know somehow,

6
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:29,276 A:middle
iAd is Apple's digital
advertising platform.

7
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:31,466 A:middle
This is what's used --
you may have seen it

8
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:33,326 A:middle
in other apps you've
used on iOS.

9
00:00:33,676 --> 00:00:35,836 A:middle
If you use iTunes Radio at
all, the ads that you see

10
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:37,426 A:middle
in iTunes Radio are
driven by iAd.

11
00:00:37,886 --> 00:00:40,066 A:middle
So that's what iAd is.

12
00:00:41,116 --> 00:00:42,646 A:middle
There's two parts to
this presentation.

13
00:00:42,856 --> 00:00:44,946 A:middle
We're going to be talking
first about monetization;

14
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:48,126 A:middle
how you can use iAd
inside your apps

15
00:00:48,126 --> 00:00:49,576 A:middle
to drive revenue for your apps.

16
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:52,936 A:middle
And the second part is
promotion; how you can use iAd

17
00:00:53,276 --> 00:00:55,296 A:middle
to get more downloads of
your app to get more users

18
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:58,546 A:middle
of your app -- to get your app
out in everyone else's hands.

19
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:01,986 A:middle
So let's start off
with monetization.

20

21
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

22
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:01,986 A:middle
So let's start off
with monetization.

23
00:01:01,986 --> 00:01:03,806 A:middle
I'm going to start off

24
00:01:04,075 --> 00:01:05,826 A:middle
with a few different pieces
we're going to talk about here.

25
00:01:06,496 --> 00:01:07,966 A:middle
Talk about some developer
benefits;

26
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:09,626 A:middle
what iAd can do for you.

27
00:01:09,626 --> 00:01:14,146 A:middle
Talk about some core concepts;
sort of an advertising 101.

28
00:01:14,696 --> 00:01:17,186 A:middle
We'll talk about improving
performance; how you can sort

29
00:01:17,186 --> 00:01:19,666 A:middle
of best use iAd and
get the most out of it.

30
00:01:20,506 --> 00:01:22,956 A:middle
We'll talk some details about
the actual code you have

31
00:01:22,956 --> 00:01:24,706 A:middle
to write to integrate
iAd inside your app,

32
00:01:24,756 --> 00:01:26,586 A:middle
which is fortunately
pretty simple.

33
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,656 A:middle
We'll talk a little
bit about testing iAd

34
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:31,076 A:middle
and making sure your integration
is actually working before you

35
00:01:31,076 --> 00:01:32,606 A:middle
get out in the app store
and then just get bugs

36
00:01:32,606 --> 00:01:37,366 A:middle
So let's start off with
developer benefits.

37
00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:44,326 A:middle
First of all, iAd provides
rich, engaging ads.

38
00:01:44,556 --> 00:01:49,856 A:middle
This is a platform that
values great ads to go

39
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:51,986 A:middle
into the great apps
that you create.

40
00:01:53,976 --> 00:01:55,506 A:middle
They're high production values.

41
00:01:56,406 --> 00:01:57,966 A:middle
There's rich media apps

42
00:01:57,966 --> 00:01:59,776 A:middle
and there's rich media
ads involved here.

43
00:01:59,776 --> 00:02:01,596 A:middle
These are things
that involve video.

44

45
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

46
00:01:59,776 --> 00:02:01,596 A:middle
These are things
that involve video.

47
00:02:02,186 --> 00:02:03,756 A:middle
They involve animations.

48
00:02:05,056 --> 00:02:06,266 A:middle
They're immersive.

49
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:10,116 A:middle
These are sometimes entire
games presented inside ads.

50
00:02:10,116 --> 00:02:11,926 A:middle
There was an Intel ad recently

51
00:02:11,926 --> 00:02:14,866 A:middle
that was literally a game
once the users tapped on it.

52
00:02:14,906 --> 00:02:15,936 A:middle
This is the other things

53
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,336 A:middle
that your users are actually
interested in engaging on,

54
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,836 A:middle
interested in tapping on,
which is great for you

55
00:02:21,186 --> 00:02:23,556 A:middle
as a potential advertising
publisher here.

56
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,806 A:middle
These are award-winning ads.

57
00:02:26,806 --> 00:02:30,946 A:middle
These are not just fly by
night, you know, one off apps --

58
00:02:30,946 --> 00:02:33,376 A:middle
or ads with link tags
in them that are going

59
00:02:33,376 --> 00:02:34,596 A:middle
to annoy the heck
out of your users.

60
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,476 A:middle
These are carefully crafted ads

61
00:02:36,816 --> 00:02:39,286 A:middle
that actually look good
as part of your app.

62
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:44,536 A:middle
Okay? In addition, Apple
is providing this SDK.

63
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:49,686 A:middle
As a result, the same care
that Apple takes with respect

64
00:02:49,686 --> 00:02:53,966 A:middle
to privacy and power efficiency
on the rest of Apple's system,

65
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,436 A:middle
Apple invests in iAd as well.

66
00:02:57,016 --> 00:03:00,556 A:middle
That means that we take
care of all of the power

67

68
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

69
00:02:57,016 --> 00:03:00,556 A:middle
That means that we take
care of all of the power

70
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:03,166 A:middle
and privacy considerations
for you

71
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,596 A:middle
so you don't have
to worry about them.

72
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:05,546 A:middle
You don't need to worry

73
00:03:05,546 --> 00:03:07,876 A:middle
about obeying the limit
ad tracking switch.

74
00:03:07,876 --> 00:03:08,866 A:middle
You don't need to obey about --

75
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:11,716 A:middle
don't need to worry about
location permissions

76
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:15,506 A:middle
or making sure that
your users' privacy

77
00:03:15,506 --> 00:03:17,596 A:middle
and personal data is
protected properly.

78
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,056 A:middle
In addition, because this
is an Apple-provided SDK,

79
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:26,556 A:middle
it's part of the iOS SDK.

80
00:03:26,556 --> 00:03:27,606 A:middle
Integration is simple.

81
00:03:28,506 --> 00:03:29,726 A:middle
There's nothing else to install.

82
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:32,036 A:middle
There are no static
libraries to include.

83
00:03:32,036 --> 00:03:33,766 A:middle
There's no third-party
headers to drop

84
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:35,146 A:middle
into your project to
clutter things up.

85
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,606 A:middle
It's all there to begin with.

86
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,136 A:middle
You can be up and
running with minimal code.

87
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,756 A:middle
As we're going to see later,
it's about two lines of code

88
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:43,706 A:middle
to get banners in your app.

89
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:49,106 A:middle
In addition, along with the
rest of the code that other --

90
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:51,636 A:middle
along with the rest of the
SDK that Apple provides,

91
00:03:51,636 --> 00:03:54,096 A:middle
there's great documentation
and great sample code available

92
00:03:54,096 --> 00:03:56,096 A:middle
to you on the websites.

93
00:03:56,256 --> 00:03:59,436 A:middle
iAd has global reach.

94
00:03:59,636 --> 00:04:00,786 A:middle
We're in 14 countries now.

95

96
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

97
00:03:59,636 --> 00:04:00,786 A:middle
We're in 14 countries now.

98
00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:02,486 A:middle
We're constantly expanding.

99
00:04:02,486 --> 00:04:03,816 A:middle
This a larger list of countries

100
00:04:03,816 --> 00:04:05,086 A:middle
than we showed up
here last year.

101
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:08,786 A:middle
And that means that you're
going to get ads in all

102
00:04:08,786 --> 00:04:10,516 A:middle
of those countries
inside your app.

103
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:13,186 A:middle
So as soon as you get your
app in all those countries,

104
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,256 A:middle
you're going to be
able to get revenue

105
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:15,326 A:middle
in those countries as well.

106
00:04:18,555 --> 00:04:20,906 A:middle
Just like the actual
app purchase

107
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:24,106 A:middle
and then in-app purchases as
well, you're going to get 70%

108
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:27,196 A:middle
of the advertising revenue
from iAd inside your app.

109
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:30,996 A:middle
Apple takes its 30% share and
everything else goes to you

110
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:33,346 A:middle
from whatever we take
in from the advertisers

111
00:04:33,586 --> 00:04:38,666 A:middle
who are producing these
ads to run inside your app.

112
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:43,046 A:middle
It's very easy for you to
get into the iAd ecosystem.

113
00:04:43,506 --> 00:04:47,176 A:middle
There's an iAd contract on the
itunesconnect.apple.com site

114
00:04:47,176 --> 00:04:47,926 A:middle
that you have to sign.

115
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:49,186 A:middle
That's pretty easy.

116
00:04:49,876 --> 00:04:51,726 A:middle
You integrate the iAd
framework; that's what the rest

117
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:52,896 A:middle
of this talk is going
to be about.

118
00:04:52,896 --> 00:04:54,876 A:middle
And then, you submit
your app for review,

119
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:56,696 A:middle
and that's really
all you have to do.

120
00:04:56,696 --> 00:05:02,476 A:middle
Okay. So that's sort of
what iAd can do for you.

121

122
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

123
00:04:56,696 --> 00:05:02,476 A:middle
Okay. So that's sort of
what iAd can do for you.

124
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:03,956 A:middle
Let's talk about
some core concepts.

125
00:05:03,956 --> 00:05:06,856 A:middle
These are some fundamental
basics of advertising

126
00:05:06,856 --> 00:05:09,406 A:middle
and some terminology
that you're going to see,

127
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:12,966 A:middle
especially on the iTunes Connect
website once you've integrated

128
00:05:12,966 --> 00:05:17,106 A:middle
iAd and are trying to track the
progress of you getting revenue

129
00:05:17,106 --> 00:05:19,236 A:middle
from iAd inside your app.

130
00:05:20,516 --> 00:05:23,186 A:middle
First of all, there's an
ad request and you're going

131
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:24,506 A:middle
to see this come up again.

132
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:25,906 A:middle
Later, you'll see
this in metrics.

133
00:05:26,146 --> 00:05:27,036 A:middle
What is an ad request?

134
00:05:27,646 --> 00:05:28,606 A:middle
It's a network request.

135
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:30,936 A:middle
It goes from the device,
through the iAd framework.

136
00:05:30,936 --> 00:05:34,206 A:middle
It's going to go out to the
iAd servers up in the cloud,

137
00:05:34,726 --> 00:05:37,006 A:middle
and hopefully, ads will
come back down to you,

138
00:05:37,286 --> 00:05:40,836 A:middle
assuming there are ads available
for your particular app

139
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:43,206 A:middle
in the current situation
of the user.

140
00:05:43,746 --> 00:05:46,526 A:middle
You know, again, if the user
is in a country we're not in,

141
00:05:46,526 --> 00:05:48,986 A:middle
you're not going to be able to
get ads there, unfortunately.

142
00:05:51,106 --> 00:05:53,616 A:middle
Once you've started
getting ads from the --

143
00:05:53,616 --> 00:05:56,336 A:middle
if you get an ad request, you
want to look at your fill-rate.

144
00:05:56,606 --> 00:06:00,526 A:middle
This is the ratio of ads
delivered by the ad service

145

146
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

147
00:05:56,606 --> 00:06:00,526 A:middle
This is the ratio of ads
delivered by the ad service

148
00:06:00,556 --> 00:06:03,056 A:middle
to the number of requests that
you actually make to the server.

149
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,796 A:middle
This is, again, going
to be determined

150
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:08,426 A:middle
by where your users are located,
what type of app you have,

151
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:11,786 A:middle
how well your app has
done with iAd in the past.

152
00:06:11,786 --> 00:06:13,356 A:middle
And we'll get to that
in a little bit --

153
00:06:13,356 --> 00:06:16,556 A:middle
a little later, as to how
that can be really important

154
00:06:16,556 --> 00:06:18,106 A:middle
in driving your fill-rate.

155
00:06:19,496 --> 00:06:22,496 A:middle
Once you've gotten ads,
you've gotten your fill-rate

156
00:06:22,496 --> 00:06:23,906 A:middle
and you've shown
ads to the user,

157
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:26,216 A:middle
there's a constant called
the tap-through rate.

158
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:28,026 A:middle
This is the number of the ads

159
00:06:28,026 --> 00:06:30,266 A:middle
that your user has
actually tapped on

160
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:33,276 A:middle
and this does not
count accidental taps.

161
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:34,716 A:middle
So if the tap -- if the
user just taps on it

162
00:06:34,716 --> 00:06:36,106 A:middle
and then closes it because
they didn't really mean,

163
00:06:36,106 --> 00:06:37,256 A:middle
that doesn't count.

164
00:06:37,256 --> 00:06:40,606 A:middle
This is the number of taps
that the user actually meant

165
00:06:40,606 --> 00:06:43,036 A:middle
to have happen relative
to the number

166
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,556 A:middle
of ads you displayed
to that user.

167
00:06:44,556 --> 00:06:45,626 A:middle
This is something
you want to attempt

168
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:48,006 A:middle
to maximize inside your app.

169
00:06:48,496 --> 00:06:50,916 A:middle
Again, though, accidental
taps don't count.

170
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,346 A:middle
So trying to play games
is not a good idea.

171
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:56,476 A:middle
Ad engagement.

172
00:06:58,506 --> 00:07:01,386 A:middle
Obviously, you need
to display the ad.

173

174
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

175
00:06:58,506 --> 00:07:01,386 A:middle
Obviously, you need
to display the ad.

176
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:03,426 A:middle
If you're not displaying
the ad to the user,

177
00:07:03,426 --> 00:07:05,036 A:middle
it doesn't matter how
many of them you request

178
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:08,406 A:middle
from the server, you're not
going to get paid for them

179
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:10,046 A:middle
and you might as well
not have bothered.

180
00:07:12,046 --> 00:07:16,046 A:middle
Once you do that, make sure it's
actually fully visible as well.

181
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:19,916 A:middle
The fact that it's onscreen and
only one pixel of it is showing

182
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,466 A:middle
because you've got it covered
up with something else,

183
00:07:21,646 --> 00:07:22,936 A:middle
that doesn't really
count either.

184
00:07:23,046 --> 00:07:25,756 A:middle
You want to make sure
that the ad is visible

185
00:07:25,756 --> 00:07:26,836 A:middle
for as long as possible.

186
00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:29,096 A:middle
Leave it onscreen.

187
00:07:30,056 --> 00:07:32,406 A:middle
Again, if it shows
up and it flashes

188
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:34,866 A:middle
for two seconds, no
one really saw it.

189
00:07:34,866 --> 00:07:35,516 A:middle
It doesn't matter.

190
00:07:35,516 --> 00:07:37,746 A:middle
You want to make sure
that ads are onscreen.

191
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:40,096 A:middle
This is -- has two benefits.

192
00:07:40,096 --> 00:07:41,996 A:middle
One, it's not distracting
to your user.

193
00:07:41,996 --> 00:07:44,236 A:middle
You're not annoying people
by flashing things on

194
00:07:44,236 --> 00:07:46,376 A:middle
and offscreen all the time that
people really don't want to see.

195
00:07:46,376 --> 00:07:49,916 A:middle
In addition, the user has
time to interact with it.

196
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:50,936 A:middle
They have time to see it.

197
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:52,336 A:middle
They have time to
see its message.

198
00:07:52,336 --> 00:07:53,536 A:middle
They have time to say, hey.

199
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:55,826 A:middle
You know, I'd actually like to
tap on this and engage with it

200
00:07:55,826 --> 00:07:59,656 A:middle
and see what's going
on under the hood.

201
00:07:59,656 --> 00:08:01,586 A:middle
That leads into allow
interaction.

202

203
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

204
00:07:59,656 --> 00:08:01,586 A:middle
That leads into allow
interaction.

205
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:04,066 A:middle
It's really easy to
put something onscreen

206
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,506 A:middle
and accidentally cover it up,

207
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:07,686 A:middle
especially accidentally
covering it up with something

208
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:09,066 A:middle
that blocks user interaction.

209
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:12,236 A:middle
If you put a banner onscreen,
you cover it up with something

210
00:08:12,286 --> 00:08:14,746 A:middle
that is, say, a transparent view

211
00:08:14,746 --> 00:08:17,256 A:middle
that does not allow user
interaction; the user can't tap

212
00:08:17,256 --> 00:08:18,086 A:middle
on the banner under the hood.

213
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:20,506 A:middle
That's not a good
situation for the ad.

214
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:22,056 A:middle
The user is going to
be trying to tap on it,

215
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:23,406 A:middle
nothing's going to happen.

216
00:08:23,406 --> 00:08:25,736 A:middle
It's going to be
a bad experience.

217
00:08:25,736 --> 00:08:28,446 A:middle
In addition, again,
you're not going

218
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:30,576 A:middle
to get the revenue you're hoping
for in this sort of situation

219
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,515 A:middle
because the ad wasn't
really onscreen.

220
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:37,405 A:middle
Okay. So there's some
sort of core concepts.

221
00:08:37,405 --> 00:08:39,035 A:middle
Talk a little bit
about what you can do

222
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:40,746 A:middle
to improve the performance

223
00:08:40,746 --> 00:08:43,645 A:middle
of iAd once you've actually
integrated it inside your app.

224
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:46,836 A:middle
First of all, revenue
starts with your app.

225
00:08:47,086 --> 00:08:49,296 A:middle
If you don't have a great app,

226
00:08:49,326 --> 00:08:51,746 A:middle
it doesn't matter how
many banners you show,

227
00:08:51,746 --> 00:08:53,176 A:middle
it doesn't matter how
many ads you show.

228
00:08:53,506 --> 00:08:54,406 A:middle
No one is using your app

229
00:08:54,406 --> 00:08:55,806 A:middle
and you're not going
to make any money.

230
00:08:55,806 --> 00:09:00,096 A:middle
So the number one thing you
can do to drive revenue via ads

231

232
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

233
00:08:55,806 --> 00:09:00,096 A:middle
So the number one thing you
can do to drive revenue via ads

234
00:09:00,096 --> 00:09:02,736 A:middle
in your app is to start
off with a great app.

235
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:07,316 A:middle
And that's what the rest of WWDC
is about, but a couple of sort

236
00:09:07,316 --> 00:09:08,556 A:middle
of small things we
can mention here.

237
00:09:08,646 --> 00:09:11,136 A:middle
First of all, app
engagement time.

238
00:09:12,256 --> 00:09:13,686 A:middle
If your -- if you
have an app that's --

239
00:09:13,796 --> 00:09:18,126 A:middle
you're trying to drive
revenue by showing ads,

240
00:09:18,636 --> 00:09:20,936 A:middle
you need to make sure that your
have sufficient engagement time

241
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,096 A:middle
for your users to
actually do this.

242
00:09:23,186 --> 00:09:26,256 A:middle
If it's a utility app that
the user is going to pull up,

243
00:09:26,256 --> 00:09:28,606 A:middle
it's going to be onscreen
for about three seconds,

244
00:09:28,606 --> 00:09:30,396 A:middle
and then they're going
to close your app again,

245
00:09:31,116 --> 00:09:33,636 A:middle
that's not enough time to
actually show ads to the users

246
00:09:33,636 --> 00:09:36,666 A:middle
and allow interaction and to get
interaction from those users.

247
00:09:36,846 --> 00:09:39,996 A:middle
So you need an app that
actually is going to be onscreen

248
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:43,756 A:middle
and that people are actually
going to engage with.

249
00:09:43,756 --> 00:09:46,436 A:middle
Again, once you've done
that, you want to make sure

250
00:09:46,436 --> 00:09:49,486 A:middle
that the ad is placed
carefully within that app.

251
00:09:49,486 --> 00:09:51,396 A:middle
Think about what
the user is doing

252
00:09:51,396 --> 00:09:52,636 A:middle
on the various screens
of your app.

253
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:56,046 A:middle
Make sure the ad is placed
appropriately within the app.

254
00:09:56,046 --> 00:09:58,486 A:middle
If you have a game,
for instance,

255
00:09:58,606 --> 00:10:01,866 A:middle
and the user is tapping and
swiping and slicing constantly,

256

257
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

258
00:09:58,606 --> 00:10:01,866 A:middle
and the user is tapping and
swiping and slicing constantly,

259
00:10:02,496 --> 00:10:04,746 A:middle
maybe that's not a great place
for a banner where they're going

260
00:10:04,746 --> 00:10:05,976 A:middle
to be accidentally tapping.

261
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,956 A:middle
The ad will pop up over
the top of everything.

262
00:10:08,996 --> 00:10:11,206 A:middle
You're going to be annoying
your users and you're going

263
00:10:11,206 --> 00:10:18,216 A:middle
to be harming your app more than
you're helping it with the ads.

264
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:21,556 A:middle
Okay? Pulling back into app
engagement time, user loyalty.

265
00:10:22,006 --> 00:10:24,246 A:middle
You need to come -- you
need your users to come back

266
00:10:24,246 --> 00:10:26,446 A:middle
to the app repeatedly.

267
00:10:27,136 --> 00:10:28,656 A:middle
That's how you get
more screen time,

268
00:10:28,656 --> 00:10:30,766 A:middle
that's how you get more ad
time for those particular --

269
00:10:31,056 --> 00:10:33,446 A:middle
for showing ads to those users.

270
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:37,396 A:middle
In addition, user loyalty
is what drives ad --

271
00:10:37,396 --> 00:10:40,046 A:middle
or app engagement and
what drives app downloads.

272
00:10:40,336 --> 00:10:42,606 A:middle
The sort of network effects that
you may have heard of before.

273
00:10:42,866 --> 00:10:45,406 A:middle
The more people are using
your app, the more they want

274
00:10:45,406 --> 00:10:47,146 A:middle
to use it, the more they're
going to tell their friends

275
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,286 A:middle
about using it, the more
downloads you're going to get.

276
00:10:49,766 --> 00:10:51,486 A:middle
Therefore, the more eyeballs
you're going to get looking

277
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:52,966 A:middle
at ads within your app.

278
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:57,606 A:middle
Okay? I mentioned that
iAd is in 14 countries.

279
00:10:57,806 --> 00:11:00,846 A:middle
That means that your app should
be in 14 countries if you want

280

281
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

282
00:10:57,806 --> 00:11:00,846 A:middle
That means that your app should
be in 14 countries if you want

283
00:11:01,016 --> 00:11:06,676 A:middle
to get as most -- the most
revenue from iAd as you can.

284
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:09,336 A:middle
Market your app to the
countries where iAd actually is.

285
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,016 A:middle
If you're -- if you've spent
the time to integrate iAd

286
00:11:12,016 --> 00:11:14,556 A:middle
into your app, you want to make
sure that your app is in all

287
00:11:14,556 --> 00:11:18,346 A:middle
of the places that iAd is so you
have the largest reach possible

288
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:21,136 A:middle
to potentially get the most
users possible for your app.

289
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,486 A:middle
A big part of that is
localizing your app.

290
00:11:24,836 --> 00:11:27,326 A:middle
If the only thing you've done
is write your app in English

291
00:11:27,626 --> 00:11:29,916 A:middle
and you're trying to get it
in all 14 of these countries,

292
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,266 A:middle
you're going to have a
hard time in countries

293
00:11:31,466 --> 00:11:33,056 A:middle
where English has
a small presence.

294
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,806 A:middle
Make sure you take the time to
localize your app appropriately

295
00:11:36,046 --> 00:11:38,066 A:middle
to drive users in
those countries.

296
00:11:41,506 --> 00:11:43,596 A:middle
And back into ad
placement a little bit,

297
00:11:43,596 --> 00:11:46,126 A:middle
because this is a piece I'm
going to keep coming back to,

298
00:11:46,126 --> 00:11:50,016 A:middle
ad placement is extraordinarily
important within your app.

299
00:11:51,246 --> 00:11:54,046 A:middle
You will recognize high-use
areas inside your app

300
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,356 A:middle
and you want to make sure you
put banners inside those areas.

301
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,056 A:middle
Those are the places where
users are going to be looking

302

303
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

304
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,056 A:middle
Those are the places where
users are going to be looking

305
00:12:00,056 --> 00:12:01,406 A:middle
at the screen for a
long period of time.

306
00:12:01,696 --> 00:12:02,736 A:middle
They're going to
have the opportunity

307
00:12:02,736 --> 00:12:03,726 A:middle
to see the app -- the ad.

308
00:12:03,726 --> 00:12:04,896 A:middle
They're going to
have the opportunity

309
00:12:04,896 --> 00:12:06,176 A:middle
to engage with the ad.

310
00:12:06,656 --> 00:12:09,326 A:middle
At the same time,
as I mentioned,

311
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:10,906 A:middle
avoid accidental taps.

312
00:12:10,906 --> 00:12:15,016 A:middle
Accidental taps are bad for your
user and they're bad for you.

313
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:18,596 A:middle
They're going to annoy
your user and iAd doesn't

314
00:12:18,596 --> 00:12:19,856 A:middle
like accidental taps either.

315
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:23,096 A:middle
So you want to make sure that
you are using the framework

316
00:12:23,096 --> 00:12:24,966 A:middle
in a way that does
not encourage them.

317
00:12:24,966 --> 00:12:29,816 A:middle
Because your app will ultimately
end up being penalized for this.

318
00:12:29,926 --> 00:12:31,346 A:middle
User context is really
important.

319
00:12:32,556 --> 00:12:35,506 A:middle
You want to want advantage of
different types of ads based

320
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:38,586 A:middle
on what the user is
doing at any given time.

321
00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:41,526 A:middle
Say the user is on the
menu screen of your game.

322
00:12:41,526 --> 00:12:42,936 A:middle
Maybe that's a great
place to put a banner

323
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:43,846 A:middle
at the bottom of the screen.

324
00:12:44,146 --> 00:12:45,226 A:middle
They're looking at the menu.

325
00:12:45,426 --> 00:12:47,526 A:middle
Maybe they notice the app
-- or the ad at the bottom.

326
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:48,886 A:middle
Maybe they tap on it
and engage with it.

327
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:52,526 A:middle
At the same time, if they tap
to go into the first level

328
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:55,816 A:middle
of your game and you immediately
pop a full-fledged ad

329
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,506 A:middle
and interrupt their experience
once they've done their first

330
00:12:58,506 --> 00:13:01,156 A:middle
action inside the game, that's
just going to annoy them.

333
00:12:58,506 --> 00:13:01,156 A:middle
action inside the game, that's
just going to annoy them.

334
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,376 A:middle
You're going to drive
users away.

335
00:13:02,646 --> 00:13:04,716 A:middle
Users aren't going to want
to engage with the ads.

336
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,866 A:middle
That's what you want
to try to avoid.

337
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:10,106 A:middle
So be very careful about
where you're putting the ads

338
00:13:10,106 --> 00:13:13,186 A:middle
within your app.

339
00:13:13,446 --> 00:13:16,766 A:middle
Once you've integrated iAd
and you can start looking

340
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:19,206 A:middle
on the website, you'll
start getting reports

341
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:20,006 A:middle
about your revenue.

342
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:21,866 A:middle
One of the things
you're going to notice,

343
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:24,126 A:middle
everyone always notices
this and brings this up,

344
00:13:24,126 --> 00:13:26,136 A:middle
is that revenue will fluctuate.

345
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:28,056 A:middle
This is perfectly natural.

346
00:13:28,676 --> 00:13:30,256 A:middle
Consumer spending is seasonal.

347
00:13:31,316 --> 00:13:33,466 A:middle
Advertiser spending
is also seasonal

348
00:13:33,466 --> 00:13:35,216 A:middle
because consumer
spending is seasonal.

349
00:13:36,026 --> 00:13:37,986 A:middle
You need to be aware of
this and watch for it.

350
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,526 A:middle
You can also take
advantage of this.

351
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,806 A:middle
Market your app accordingly.

352
00:13:43,446 --> 00:13:47,106 A:middle
Start of summer, back to
school, holiday season;

353
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:49,356 A:middle
these are the times
when users are going

354
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:52,586 A:middle
out to get new devices, they're
going out to get new apps,

355
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:56,396 A:middle
and advertisers are going out to
get eyeballs inside those apps.

356
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,036 A:middle
So that's when you
want to try and get --

357
00:13:58,706 --> 00:14:05,226 A:middle
try and put all of your money
into pushing your app out there.

358

359
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

360
00:13:58,706 --> 00:14:05,226 A:middle
try and put all of your money
into pushing your app out there.

361
00:14:05,426 --> 00:14:07,226 A:middle
Okay. We've talked about ads.

362
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:08,426 A:middle
We've talked about impressions.

363
00:14:08,476 --> 00:14:09,766 A:middle
We've talked about
tap-through's.

364
00:14:09,896 --> 00:14:11,186 A:middle
We've talked about fill-rate.

365
00:14:11,406 --> 00:14:13,526 A:middle
This is a virtuous cycle.

366
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,326 A:middle
Okay? You're going to
get ads to begin with.

367
00:14:15,426 --> 00:14:17,606 A:middle
They're going to
lead to impressions.

368
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,376 A:middle
Impressions are going to
lead to tap-through's.

369
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:21,706 A:middle
The more tap-through's you get,
the more ads you're going to get

370
00:14:21,706 --> 00:14:24,366 A:middle
from the ad server, the more
impressions you're going

371
00:14:26,776 --> 00:14:27,526 A:middle
to get Okay.

372
00:14:27,816 --> 00:14:29,126 A:middle
So that's performance.

373
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,526 A:middle
Now that we've done that, now we
can go into some actual details

374
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:34,446 A:middle
about how you actually go about
integrating all of this stuff,

375
00:14:34,556 --> 00:14:35,646 A:middle
sort of the meat of this talk.

376
00:14:37,516 --> 00:14:39,016 A:middle
There's 4 ad formats.

377
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:41,386 A:middle
There's banner, there's
interstitial,

378
00:14:41,386 --> 00:14:44,216 A:middle
there's medium rect,
and a pre-roll video ad.

379
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:46,366 A:middle
We'll talk about each
of these four in turn.

380
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:49,276 A:middle
As I mentioned earlier,
you're going to want

381
00:14:49,276 --> 00:14:51,816 A:middle
to choose the correct
ad for your app

382
00:14:51,816 --> 00:14:53,456 A:middle
in the various contexts
within your app.

383
00:14:53,746 --> 00:14:55,696 A:middle
So all four of these types

384
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:59,266 A:middle
of ads are important
for many, many apps.

385
00:14:59,526 --> 00:15:02,706 A:middle
We'll start off with banner.

386

387
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

388
00:14:59,526 --> 00:15:02,706 A:middle
We'll start off with banner.

389
00:15:04,356 --> 00:15:05,676 A:middle
Okay? So what is a banner?

390
00:15:06,076 --> 00:15:08,576 A:middle
It's a slim device width view.

391
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:11,696 A:middle
It's placed at the
bottom of your content.

392
00:15:12,156 --> 00:15:15,196 A:middle
It continuously loads ads.

393
00:15:15,196 --> 00:15:19,716 A:middle
You may have used other iAd
SDKs or ad SDKs where you've got

394
00:15:19,716 --> 00:15:20,676 A:middle
to make a specific request.

395
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:21,666 A:middle
This isn't that.

396
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:22,286 A:middle
You create a view.

397
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:24,036 A:middle
It's going to show up at
the bottom of the page

398
00:15:24,186 --> 00:15:26,636 A:middle
and will continuously
load ads over time

399
00:15:26,636 --> 00:15:28,326 A:middle
as new ads are downloaded
from the ad server.

400
00:15:28,496 --> 00:15:31,806 A:middle
There's nothing you have
to do to manage that.

401
00:15:31,956 --> 00:15:34,246 A:middle
Once the user taps on it, it's
going to go into some sort

402
00:15:34,246 --> 00:15:38,276 A:middle
of fullscreen ad
experience and supported

403
00:15:38,276 --> 00:15:39,596 A:middle
on both iPhone and iPad.

404
00:15:39,596 --> 00:15:41,686 A:middle
It has been since
the beginning of iAd.

405
00:15:43,536 --> 00:15:46,626 A:middle
Integrating banners
in your app is

406
00:15:46,626 --> 00:15:48,236 A:middle
about the simplest
thing that you could do.

407
00:15:48,936 --> 00:15:49,996 A:middle
There's three steps of this.

408
00:15:49,996 --> 00:15:51,536 A:middle
You're going to link
the iAd framework.

409
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:56,826 A:middle
You're going to import
the iAd header,

410
00:15:56,826 --> 00:15:58,116 A:middle
which is the first
line that popped there.

411
00:15:58,116 --> 00:16:00,056 A:middle
And you're going to configure
your view controller,

412

413
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

414
00:15:58,116 --> 00:16:00,056 A:middle
And you're going to configure
your view controller,

415
00:16:00,056 --> 00:16:02,626 A:middle
which involves setting the
.canDisplayBannerAds property

416
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:04,326 A:middle
to yes on your view controller.

417
00:16:05,316 --> 00:16:05,866 A:middle
That's it.

418
00:16:06,506 --> 00:16:09,186 A:middle
If you've done that, you've
got a banner inside your app.

419
00:16:09,186 --> 00:16:12,046 A:middle
Okay? So what does
that look like?

420
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:13,526 A:middle
Okay. Loading an ad.

421
00:16:14,476 --> 00:16:15,316 A:middle
You've got your view.

422
00:16:15,686 --> 00:16:18,336 A:middle
The moment you set the
.canDisplayBannerAds property

423
00:16:18,336 --> 00:16:20,466 A:middle
on it, we're going to do
something under the hood

424
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:21,526 A:middle
to your view controller.

425
00:16:21,956 --> 00:16:25,186 A:middle
Your view is going to turn
into original content view.

426
00:16:25,186 --> 00:16:27,526 A:middle
We're going to move your view
over to original content view

427
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,746 A:middle
and we're going to take a
review on your view controller.

428
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:31,616 A:middle
So it's very important
for you to remember

429
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,756 A:middle
if you're subsequently
attempting to access your view

430
00:16:34,756 --> 00:16:35,786 A:middle
on that view controller.

431
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:39,366 A:middle
We're then going to make a
request up the ad server.

432
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:42,106 A:middle
It's going to come and hopefully
a banner is going to load.

433
00:16:42,706 --> 00:16:47,116 A:middle
And at that time, we're going
to move the banner onscreen

434
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:49,216 A:middle
and we're going to resize
your original content view

435
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,986 A:middle
appropriately and with
the appropriate animation

436
00:16:51,986 --> 00:16:52,956 A:middle
to move the thing onscreen

437
00:16:52,956 --> 00:16:57,866 A:middle
so the user can actually
look at it.

438
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:59,376 A:middle
Once it's been onscreen
for a while,

439
00:16:59,376 --> 00:17:01,116 A:middle
hopefully the user is going
to go ahead and tap on it.

440

441
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

442
00:16:59,376 --> 00:17:01,116 A:middle
hopefully the user is going
to go ahead and tap on it.

443
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:02,356 A:middle
And at that point,

444
00:17:02,706 --> 00:17:04,576 A:middle
the fullscreen ad
experience is going to pop up.

445
00:17:04,576 --> 00:17:08,616 A:middle
When that happens, there are a
couple of things you need to do.

446
00:17:08,806 --> 00:17:11,976 A:middle
First of which is to pause
activity in -viewWillDisappear:.

447
00:17:11,976 --> 00:17:15,036 A:middle
Your app is probably doing
things in the background while

448
00:17:15,036 --> 00:17:16,246 A:middle
that banner is onscreen.

449
00:17:16,705 --> 00:17:18,796 A:middle
When the user wants
to engage with the ad,

450
00:17:18,796 --> 00:17:20,376 A:middle
you want to get out of the way.

451
00:17:20,945 --> 00:17:22,116 A:middle
If you're playing music.

452
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:24,165 A:middle
If you're running
a game simulation.

453
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:26,445 A:middle
If you're doing anything else
that's potentially intensive

454
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:28,956 A:middle
or distracting, you're
going to pause that activity

455
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:31,266 A:middle
in -viewWillDisappear:
so that it gets

456
00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:34,106 A:middle
out of the way of the ad.

457
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:36,756 A:middle
Eventually, the user will be
done interacting with the ad.

458
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:37,536 A:middle
They'll dismiss it.

459
00:17:37,676 --> 00:17:38,826 A:middle
You'll get -vidDidAppear:.

460
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:40,706 A:middle
Resume all that activity.

461
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:43,286 A:middle
Once the ad's gone, you want
to start the music up again.

462
00:17:43,286 --> 00:17:48,476 A:middle
You want to start your
game simulation, et cetera.

463
00:17:48,476 --> 00:17:51,496 A:middle
Eventually, say the user goes
out of network connectivity

464
00:17:51,496 --> 00:17:54,266 A:middle
or something, you may not
have an ad available anymore.

465
00:17:55,046 --> 00:17:58,296 A:middle
When that happens, the banner is
going to be moved off of screen.

466
00:17:59,106 --> 00:18:03,066 A:middle
The original content view
will resized and that --

467

468
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

469
00:17:59,106 --> 00:18:03,066 A:middle
The original content view
will resized and that --

470
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:04,166 A:middle
and you can, you know,

471
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,756 A:middle
wait until it hopefully
reloads again.

472
00:18:06,936 --> 00:18:09,416 A:middle
In addition to waiting for
the network connectivity

473
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,826 A:middle
to just move the banner
back off of screen,

474
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:13,976 A:middle
you can control the banner
visibility whenever you

475
00:18:13,976 --> 00:18:14,446 A:middle
would like.

476
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:17,286 A:middle
If something happens within
your app that you would

477
00:18:17,286 --> 00:18:19,226 A:middle
like to move the banner
offscreen temporarily,

478
00:18:19,226 --> 00:18:20,316 A:middle
you can go ahead and so.

479
00:18:20,846 --> 00:18:23,246 A:middle
Just go ahead and set
.canDisplayBannerAds to no.

480
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:26,366 A:middle
Just don't forget to
set it back to yes

481
00:18:26,446 --> 00:18:27,626 A:middle
when you want to re-enable it.

482
00:18:27,986 --> 00:18:30,676 A:middle
Make sure you put the ad back
onscreen whenever you actually

483
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:33,076 A:middle
need to.

484
00:18:33,296 --> 00:18:34,606 A:middle
Okay. So that's banners.

485
00:18:35,036 --> 00:18:37,326 A:middle
Let's talk about interstitials
next, which is the sort

486
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:39,836 A:middle
of second major type of
banner -- type of ad here.

487
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:41,956 A:middle
Very different than banners.

488
00:18:42,366 --> 00:18:44,436 A:middle
Rather than something
being permanently onscreen,

489
00:18:44,886 --> 00:18:46,866 A:middle
they're immediate
fullscreen display.

490
00:18:47,536 --> 00:18:49,096 A:middle
They immediately take
over the entire screen

491
00:18:49,096 --> 00:18:50,036 A:middle
when you want to present them.

492
00:18:50,036 --> 00:18:52,646 A:middle
The user is immediately
able to interact with them.

493
00:18:53,396 --> 00:18:58,256 A:middle
Okay? They've been on iPad since
iOS 4.3 and they were introduced

494
00:18:58,256 --> 00:19:00,556 A:middle
on the phone in iOS 7 last year.

495

496
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

497
00:18:58,256 --> 00:19:00,556 A:middle
on the phone in iOS 7 last year.

498
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:05,836 A:middle
There's two major ways to handle
interstitial presentation.

499
00:19:05,836 --> 00:19:07,566 A:middle
The first is automatic
presentation.

500
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,416 A:middle
Just like banners, it's pretty
simple to configure here.

501
00:19:10,766 --> 00:19:12,766 A:middle
Rather than setting
.canDisplayBannerAds,

502
00:19:12,766 --> 00:19:15,456 A:middle
you're going to set
.interstitialPresentationPolicy

503
00:19:15,736 --> 00:19:18,556 A:middle
to ADInterstitial
PresentationPolicyAutomatic.

504
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:21,286 A:middle
What that does is tell
the iAd framework, hey,

505
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:25,946 A:middle
this is a great view controller
to show ads on and whenever you,

506
00:19:25,946 --> 00:19:28,026 A:middle
as the iAd framework,
think is a great time

507
00:19:28,026 --> 00:19:29,916 A:middle
to show ads, go ahead and do so.

508
00:19:30,356 --> 00:19:33,236 A:middle
At the moment, that means
that we're going to show ads

509
00:19:33,596 --> 00:19:37,296 A:middle
when this view controller first
moves onscreen, when it appears.

510
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,786 A:middle
I'm going to take
that as an opportunity

511
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:41,426 A:middle
to show an interstitial
ad if one is available.

512
00:19:42,236 --> 00:19:44,336 A:middle
So to do that, just take
your view controller,

513
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:45,706 A:middle
push it onscreen, make it --

514
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:47,206 A:middle
push it into your
navigation stack,

515
00:19:47,206 --> 00:19:48,696 A:middle
or however you want
to put it onscreen.

516
00:19:49,836 --> 00:19:52,776 A:middle
That moves in and we're going
to pop an ad up over top of it.

517
00:19:53,086 --> 00:19:54,496 A:middle
When the user is
done interacting

518
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:57,776 A:middle
with it, it'll come back off.

519
00:19:58,136 --> 00:19:59,716 A:middle
In addition to automatic
presentation,

520
00:19:59,716 --> 00:20:01,236 A:middle
there's manual presentation.

521

522
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

523
00:19:59,716 --> 00:20:01,236 A:middle
there's manual presentation.

524
00:20:01,236 --> 00:20:02,936 A:middle
Just set the presentation policy

525
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:05,286 A:middle
to ADInterstitial
PresentationPolicyManual

526
00:20:05,786 --> 00:20:08,436 A:middle
and instead of us automatically
presenting it whenever the view

527
00:20:08,436 --> 00:20:10,396 A:middle
moves onscreen, you can call --

528
00:20:10,396 --> 00:20:12,976 A:middle
request interstitial ad
presentation to attempt

529
00:20:12,976 --> 00:20:15,096 A:middle
to display it whenever you
think it's an appropriate time

530
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:16,976 A:middle
for an ad to pop up over
top of your content.

531
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,446 A:middle
Next, preparing for
presentation.

532
00:20:25,446 --> 00:20:28,966 A:middle
Because interstitials don't
have something onscreen,

533
00:20:28,966 --> 00:20:31,046 A:middle
something sitting
there requesting ads,

534
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:32,786 A:middle
attempting to display
things at all times,

535
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:35,506 A:middle
you want to notify the iAd
framework that you would

536
00:20:35,506 --> 00:20:38,836 A:middle
like to present interstitials
in the future so we can go ahead

537
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:41,726 A:middle
and make an ad request and
have an interstitial waiting

538
00:20:41,726 --> 00:20:43,846 A:middle
for you when that time comes.

539
00:20:44,296 --> 00:20:46,496 A:middle
To do that, you're going to want

540
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:51,776 A:middle
to call UIViewController
prepareIntersteritalAds inside

541
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:54,296 A:middle
something early in
your app's life cycle.

542
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,776 A:middle
Application did finish launching

543
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:57,606 A:middle
with options is a
good opportunity here.

544
00:20:57,606 --> 00:20:59,456 A:middle
If you're doing a lot of
other work at that point,

545
00:20:59,456 --> 00:21:00,506 A:middle
maybe defer it a little bit.

546

547
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

548
00:20:59,456 --> 00:21:00,506 A:middle
maybe defer it a little bit.

549
00:21:00,696 --> 00:21:03,496 A:middle
But you want to call this
prior to your attempt

550
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:05,926 A:middle
to present an interstitial
for the first time.

551
00:21:06,336 --> 00:21:08,966 A:middle
That gives the iAd
framework enough time to go

552
00:21:08,966 --> 00:21:12,056 A:middle
out to the network, request an
ad, and have everything ready

553
00:21:12,056 --> 00:21:14,846 A:middle
to present by the time you
want one to be presented.

554
00:21:14,846 --> 00:21:17,786 A:middle
That will prevent you from
missing ad opportunities.

555
00:21:18,806 --> 00:21:21,456 A:middle
Okay. So that's banners
and interstitials.

556
00:21:21,586 --> 00:21:24,346 A:middle
We're going to go from
here into a quick demo just

557
00:21:24,346 --> 00:21:26,506 A:middle
of the APIs I just went over.

558
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:33,076 A:middle
So we'll switch over to
my demo machine here.

559
00:21:33,596 --> 00:21:36,606 A:middle
What I'm going to start off
with here, I'll just draw

560
00:21:36,606 --> 00:21:40,976 A:middle
up my little app, is a very
simple master detail app here.

561
00:21:40,976 --> 00:21:43,396 A:middle
Just some news articles.

562
00:21:43,396 --> 00:21:45,776 A:middle
I can click on one of these
news articles and bring it up.

563
00:21:45,776 --> 00:21:49,646 A:middle
And what we'd like to do is
take this app and ad some ads

564
00:21:49,646 --> 00:21:51,106 A:middle
to it, monetize it with iAd.

565
00:21:51,706 --> 00:21:54,126 A:middle
So if I can quit the
simulator again here.

566
00:21:54,766 --> 00:21:56,026 A:middle
What do we want to
do here first?

567
00:21:56,346 --> 00:22:00,316 A:middle
The first thing we're going to
do is ad a banner to the bottom

568

569
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

570
00:21:56,346 --> 00:22:00,316 A:middle
The first thing we're going to
do is ad a banner to the bottom

571
00:22:00,316 --> 00:22:03,136 A:middle
of the MasterViewController,
the bottom of that article list.

572
00:22:03,266 --> 00:22:05,346 A:middle
So inside our
MasterViewController here,

573
00:22:05,906 --> 00:22:09,046 A:middle
we're going to import
the iAd header.

574
00:22:09,886 --> 00:22:10,866 A:middle
Do that like this.

575
00:22:10,866 --> 00:22:14,346 A:middle
And then, inside, akakeFrom Nib,
all we're going to do is call --

576
00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:18,026 A:middle
set .canDisplayBannerAds to yes,

577
00:22:19,106 --> 00:22:20,516 A:middle
and that's really
all we have to do.

578
00:22:21,036 --> 00:22:22,436 A:middle
Oh, one more thing.

579
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:26,806 A:middle
We need to go in here,
development phases,

580
00:22:26,806 --> 00:22:29,426 A:middle
and ensure that we link
against the iAd framework.

581
00:22:33,056 --> 00:22:36,036 A:middle
Make sure the APIs are actually
available to us so we go back

582
00:22:36,116 --> 00:22:38,096 A:middle
to MasterViewController here.

583
00:22:38,576 --> 00:22:39,406 A:middle
Go ahead and run.

584
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:48,916 A:middle
And we'll see that with two
lines of code and one link,

585
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,766 A:middle
we have banners at the
bottom of our screen

586
00:22:51,176 --> 00:22:54,496 A:middle
that are automatically in
line with our view controller.

587
00:22:55,516 --> 00:22:58,586 A:middle
Now, we only set that on
the MasterViewController.

588
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,216 A:middle
That means that when we go into
an article, there's no ad there,

589

590
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

591
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,216 A:middle
That means that when we go into
an article, there's no ad there,

592
00:23:01,216 --> 00:23:02,486 A:middle
which is a little
bit unfortunate.

593
00:23:03,196 --> 00:23:05,346 A:middle
So the next thing we want
to do is take advantage

594
00:23:05,346 --> 00:23:08,316 A:middle
of the other type of ad that
we talked about, interstitials,

595
00:23:08,686 --> 00:23:11,366 A:middle
to present ad to the user prior

596
00:23:11,366 --> 00:23:13,346 A:middle
to them actually being
able to read the article.

597
00:23:13,386 --> 00:23:16,526 A:middle
So once they've tapped
on the article title,

598
00:23:16,846 --> 00:23:18,716 A:middle
we want to add the
popup over the top

599
00:23:18,716 --> 00:23:20,706 A:middle
of the screen before they
can actually see the article.

600
00:23:21,036 --> 00:23:24,236 A:middle
So let's go ahead
and quit this again.

601
00:23:25,176 --> 00:23:29,826 A:middle
And this time, we're
going to, down here,

602
00:23:30,306 --> 00:23:32,816 A:middle
inside our prepareForSegue
function, we're just going

603
00:23:32,816 --> 00:23:34,986 A:middle
to set up the
DetailViewController

604
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:36,836 A:middle
that shows the actual article.

605
00:23:37,596 --> 00:23:41,626 A:middle
We're going to grab this
destination.interstitial

606
00:23:41,626 --> 00:23:43,966 A:middle
PresentationPolicy
AD.interstitial

607
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:46,596 A:middle
PresentationPolicy
Automatic so that we can say

608
00:23:46,596 --> 00:23:48,046 A:middle
that on this
DetailViewController,

609
00:23:48,046 --> 00:23:49,266 A:middle
the thing that's
showing the article,

610
00:23:49,656 --> 00:23:53,056 A:middle
we want the iAD framework
to manager presentation

611
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:56,066 A:middle
of interstitial ads over
top of this view controller.

612
00:23:57,236 --> 00:24:00,596 A:middle
Once we've done that, that's
going to get interstitials shown

613

614
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

615
00:23:57,236 --> 00:24:00,596 A:middle
Once we've done that, that's
going to get interstitials shown

616
00:24:00,596 --> 00:24:01,476 A:middle
over that view controller.

617
00:24:01,476 --> 00:24:04,576 A:middle
However, we want to make sure
that the iAD framework knows

618
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:05,236 A:middle
to go out and look

619
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:07,146 A:middle
for interstitials
before the user taps

620
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:08,616 A:middle
on an article for
the first time.

621
00:24:08,966 --> 00:24:11,266 A:middle
So to do that, we're
going to go over here.

622
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:13,056 A:middle
We're going to get to
our AppDelegate here

623
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:16,416 A:middle
and we're just going to
grab UIViewController

624
00:24:16,936 --> 00:24:18,556 A:middle
prepareInterstitialAds.

625
00:24:18,756 --> 00:24:22,196 A:middle
Make sure we import
the header as well.

626
00:24:22,766 --> 00:24:25,456 A:middle
That tells iAd, hey, go
prepare interstitial ads

627
00:24:25,456 --> 00:24:26,936 A:middle
so they're ready
for our user here.

628
00:24:26,936 --> 00:24:28,406 A:middle
So I'll go ahead and save this.

629
00:24:29,626 --> 00:24:31,936 A:middle
Run our demo again.

630
00:24:33,566 --> 00:24:36,016 A:middle
Once again, we've got
the article view here.

631
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,186 A:middle
We've got a banner loaded
at the bottom that happened.

632
00:24:39,026 --> 00:24:43,566 A:middle
Now, once the user taps on this,
the interstitial ad is going

633
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:45,146 A:middle
to pop up over top
of the article.

634
00:24:45,306 --> 00:24:47,196 A:middle
Once the appropriate
time is expired,

635
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:49,716 A:middle
the user is done interacting
with this, they can go ahead

636
00:24:49,716 --> 00:24:52,516 A:middle
and close that and the article
is behind and they can go ahead

637
00:24:52,516 --> 00:24:54,206 A:middle
and start reading their article.

638
00:24:54,276 --> 00:24:58,786 A:middle
So that's basically how easy
it is to integrate banners

639
00:24:58,786 --> 00:25:01,766 A:middle
and interstitials to your app.

640

641
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

642
00:24:58,786 --> 00:25:01,766 A:middle
and interstitials to your app.

643
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:04,116 A:middle
So we'll go back to the slides.

644
00:25:04,116 --> 00:25:08,906 A:middle
Okay. So that's banners
and interstitials,

645
00:25:08,906 --> 00:25:12,716 A:middle
which are the first two
major types of ads for iAd.

646
00:25:12,716 --> 00:25:15,576 A:middle
They were also the first two
types of ads that iAd had.

647
00:25:15,576 --> 00:25:17,276 A:middle
Those were the ones that were
sort of available pretty much

648
00:25:17,276 --> 00:25:18,396 A:middle
from the beginning of iAd.

649
00:25:18,396 --> 00:25:20,646 A:middle
There are a couple of
newer types that we've got.

650
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:22,166 A:middle
The first new type, it's --

651
00:25:22,686 --> 00:25:23,706 A:middle
talking about banners

652
00:25:24,126 --> 00:25:25,926 A:middle
and interstitial a
little bit more, sorry.

653
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:31,916 A:middle
First of all, use
.canDisplayBannerAds

654
00:25:32,026 --> 00:25:34,006 A:middle
and
.interstitialPresentationPolicy

655
00:25:34,086 --> 00:25:36,166 A:middle
on your controllers
as much as possible.

656
00:25:36,376 --> 00:25:39,096 A:middle
We talked about ad engagement.

657
00:25:39,096 --> 00:25:42,326 A:middle
We talked about the user having
the opportunity to see the ads,

658
00:25:43,316 --> 00:25:45,556 A:middle
leaving them onscreen, the
user having the opportunity

659
00:25:45,556 --> 00:25:46,576 A:middle
to engage with the ads.

660
00:25:47,016 --> 00:25:51,846 A:middle
Setting these properties
is a big part of that.

661
00:25:51,946 --> 00:25:54,256 A:middle
In addition, remember to
use .originalContentView

662
00:25:54,256 --> 00:25:56,306 A:middle
when you actually use
canDisplayBannerAds.

663
00:25:56,646 --> 00:25:59,706 A:middle
It's very important that once
you set canDisplayBannerAds,

664
00:25:59,706 --> 00:26:02,376 A:middle
you realize that you have
given over control of view

665

666
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

667
00:25:59,706 --> 00:26:02,376 A:middle
you realize that you have
given over control of view

668
00:26:02,376 --> 00:26:03,946 A:middle
to the iAd framework

669
00:26:04,426 --> 00:26:07,676 A:middle
and .originalContentView
is yours to continue using.

670
00:26:12,076 --> 00:26:14,206 A:middle
Pick the right transitions
for interstitials.

671
00:26:14,556 --> 00:26:17,426 A:middle
Think about what your user
is doing at any given time

672
00:26:17,426 --> 00:26:18,176 A:middle
when they're transitioning

673
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,596 A:middle
from view controller
to view controller.

674
00:26:19,986 --> 00:26:20,546 A:middle
And make sure

675
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:23,506 A:middle
that .interstitialPresentation
PolicyAutomatic is set

676
00:26:23,736 --> 00:26:26,376 A:middle
on the appropriate view
controllers for an ad to show

677
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,086 A:middle
up when they first pop up.

678
00:26:28,136 --> 00:26:31,436 A:middle
For instance, in the news
demo that we just showed you,

679
00:26:32,656 --> 00:26:36,196 A:middle
having that show up on the
main article list is probably

680
00:26:36,196 --> 00:26:37,106 A:middle
not appropriate.

681
00:26:37,106 --> 00:26:39,046 A:middle
That would just be distracting
and annoying to users.

682
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:42,536 A:middle
Having it on the article view
controller, on the other hand,

683
00:26:43,056 --> 00:26:45,776 A:middle
just gives a gating
function to allowing the user

684
00:26:45,776 --> 00:26:47,766 A:middle
to actually use your content.

685
00:26:47,766 --> 00:26:49,946 A:middle
That's sort of the appropriate
use for the interstitial.

686
00:26:52,956 --> 00:26:55,046 A:middle
Be consistent throughout
your navigation stack

687
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:55,896 A:middle
in your use of these.

688
00:26:55,896 --> 00:26:59,816 A:middle
This is particularly important
for navigation controllers,

689

690
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

691
00:27:00,106 --> 00:27:02,106 A:middle
in particular deep
navigation controllers.

692
00:27:02,796 --> 00:27:05,576 A:middle
What I mean by this
is, in particular

693
00:27:05,576 --> 00:27:07,126 A:middle
with .canDisplayBannerAds,

694
00:27:07,696 --> 00:27:10,306 A:middle
if you have a deep navigation
hierarchy, you want to attempt

695
00:27:10,306 --> 00:27:13,256 A:middle
to set .canDisplayBannerAds on
as many of the view controllers

696
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:16,016 A:middle
that you're going to be pushing
into that hierarchy as possible

697
00:27:16,496 --> 00:27:18,806 A:middle
to ensure that the
ad remains onscreen

698
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,566 A:middle
as the user navigates
throughout that hierarchy.

699
00:27:22,256 --> 00:27:24,426 A:middle
Otherwise, you have the
possibility of the ad popping

700
00:27:24,426 --> 00:27:25,956 A:middle
up onscreen for a second.

701
00:27:25,956 --> 00:27:28,776 A:middle
The user taps on something,
the ad goes back away.

702
00:27:29,126 --> 00:27:31,656 A:middle
They tapped to something
else, maybe the ad comes back.

703
00:27:32,036 --> 00:27:33,516 A:middle
That's distracting to your.

704
00:27:33,806 --> 00:27:35,706 A:middle
At the same time, it
doesn't allow the ad

705
00:27:35,706 --> 00:27:38,916 A:middle
to stay onscreen long
enough for the user

706
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:43,506 A:middle
to actually engage with that ad.

707
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:46,586 A:middle
Okay. So now, we're done talking
with banners and interstitials.

708
00:27:46,796 --> 00:27:49,576 A:middle
Let's talk about medium rect,
which is then next major type

709
00:27:49,576 --> 00:27:52,106 A:middle
of ad that iAd provides to you.

710
00:27:52,106 --> 00:27:54,346 A:middle
What is a medium rect?

711
00:27:55,556 --> 00:27:58,056 A:middle
It is an International
Advertising Bureau medium

712
00:27:58,056 --> 00:27:59,896 A:middle
rectangle; it's a
standard ad type.

713
00:27:59,896 --> 00:28:02,146 A:middle
It's positioned inline
with your content.

714

715
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

716
00:27:59,896 --> 00:28:02,146 A:middle
It's positioned inline
with your content.

717
00:28:02,956 --> 00:28:06,166 A:middle
It's a standardized size;
this is the same size

718
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:08,026 A:middle
that you may have seen when
you're browsing the web.

719
00:28:08,026 --> 00:28:08,976 A:middle
You see this sort of square

720
00:28:08,976 --> 00:28:12,416 A:middle
or rectangular ads positioned
inline with the web content.

721
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,136 A:middle
This is the same type
of ad that we've got.

722
00:28:14,196 --> 00:28:18,216 A:middle
Just like banners, they
automatically cycle over time.

723
00:28:18,856 --> 00:28:21,616 A:middle
So you put them onscreen,
new ads will be loaded

724
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,456 A:middle
out of the iAd framework,
feels appropriate,

725
00:28:23,456 --> 00:28:25,306 A:middle
and will automatically
manage making a request

726
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:26,526 A:middle
and putting ads in here for you.

727
00:28:26,526 --> 00:28:31,876 A:middle
And just like banners, there's
a fullscreen ad experience once

728
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,846 A:middle
the user taps on and
engages with this banner.

729
00:28:35,656 --> 00:28:41,466 A:middle
They were introduced in iOS 6
on iPads and happy to announce

730
00:28:41,546 --> 00:28:44,226 A:middle
that in iOS 8, we're adding
this to phone as well.

731
00:28:47,006 --> 00:28:51,066 A:middle
Okay. So what's the medium
rectangle lifecycle look like?

732
00:28:51,346 --> 00:28:56,466 A:middle
Because these banners are not
managed by the iAd framework,

733
00:28:56,466 --> 00:29:00,536 A:middle
you have to do a little bit
more work to put these onscreen.

734

735
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

736
00:28:56,466 --> 00:29:00,536 A:middle
you have to do a little bit
more work to put these onscreen.

737
00:29:00,996 --> 00:29:04,316 A:middle
Okay? You need to create
the banner explicitly rather

738
00:29:04,316 --> 00:29:06,176 A:middle
than just setting a property
on your view controller.

739
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,036 A:middle
You need to configure a
delegate, which is going

740
00:29:09,036 --> 00:29:10,826 A:middle
to allow us to tell you
when certain things happen

741
00:29:10,826 --> 00:29:12,766 A:middle
and we're going to get into the
code for this in the next slide.

742
00:29:13,686 --> 00:29:16,836 A:middle
Implement the delegate protocol
so you can actually take notice

743
00:29:16,836 --> 00:29:18,816 A:middle
of these events and move
the thing on and offscreen

744
00:29:18,816 --> 00:29:20,896 A:middle
as the banner loads and unloads.

745
00:29:21,066 --> 00:29:24,176 A:middle
You're going to show the banner

746
00:29:24,236 --> 00:29:26,016 A:middle
when you receive the
-bannerViewDidLoadAd:

747
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:27,836 A:middle
property -- or delegate
callback.

748
00:29:29,136 --> 00:29:30,556 A:middle
You're going to pause activity

749
00:29:30,556 --> 00:29:33,096 A:middle
in -bannerViewAction ShouldBegin
:willLeaveApplication:.

750
00:29:33,096 --> 00:29:36,746 A:middle
This is analogous to getting
the view will disappear message

751
00:29:36,856 --> 00:29:39,506 A:middle
from interstitials or banners.

752
00:29:39,956 --> 00:29:43,206 A:middle
And you want to resume activity
in -bannerViewActionDidFinish:,

753
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:44,426 A:middle
analogous to view will appear.

754
00:29:44,426 --> 00:29:47,946 A:middle
You're going to hide the
banner in -bannerView:

755
00:29:47,946 --> 00:29:49,356 A:middle
didFailTo ReceiveAdWithError:.

756
00:29:49,356 --> 00:29:50,136 A:middle
This is important.

757
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:53,446 A:middle
This indicates that your banner
no longer has an add loaded

758
00:29:53,446 --> 00:29:55,586 A:middle
and it should no longer be
taking up space onscreen.

759
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:58,276 A:middle
So what does this look like?

760
00:29:59,066 --> 00:30:00,606 A:middle
First of all, creating a banner.

761

762
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

763
00:29:59,066 --> 00:30:00,606 A:middle
First of all, creating a banner.

764
00:30:01,456 --> 00:30:03,276 A:middle
You're going to import
the iAd header at the top.

765
00:30:03,406 --> 00:30:06,506 A:middle
You're going to implement
ADBanner ViewDelegate

766
00:30:06,506 --> 00:30:08,016 A:middle
on whatever object you would

767
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:10,416 A:middle
like to actually be managing
this particular banner.

768
00:30:11,756 --> 00:30:13,336 A:middle
Then you're going to
create the banner view.

769
00:30:13,336 --> 00:30:15,456 A:middle
You can do that with
initWith AdType:

770
00:30:15,456 --> 00:30:18,826 A:middle
ADAdType MediumRectangle,
and then you're going

771
00:30:18,826 --> 00:30:19,576 A:middle
to set the delegate

772
00:30:19,636 --> 00:30:20,936 A:middle
to the object that's
implementing the

773
00:30:20,936 --> 00:30:21,766 A:middle
delegate protocol.

774
00:30:22,376 --> 00:30:24,236 A:middle
So what does that delegate
protocol look like?

775
00:30:24,706 --> 00:30:28,346 A:middle
Well, first how does a medium
rect actually load and unload?

776
00:30:28,346 --> 00:30:29,466 A:middle
It's going to start
out unloaded.

777
00:30:29,466 --> 00:30:30,936 A:middle
When you first create it
there's nothing in there.

778
00:30:30,936 --> 00:30:32,016 A:middle
We haven't made an ad request.

779
00:30:32,016 --> 00:30:33,316 A:middle
There's nothing to
put onscreen yet.

780
00:30:33,496 --> 00:30:35,786 A:middle
So don't put it onscreen
when you first create it.

781
00:30:35,786 --> 00:30:36,976 A:middle
It's just going to
be a blank slide,

782
00:30:36,976 --> 00:30:40,436 A:middle
and we're going to
send you an error.

783
00:30:40,586 --> 00:30:42,566 A:middle
Once you get a
bannerViewDidLoadAd that's your

784
00:30:42,566 --> 00:30:45,656 A:middle
cue that there is an ad
available inside your medium

785
00:30:45,656 --> 00:30:47,296 A:middle
rect, and you should
move it onscreen.

786
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:50,046 A:middle
You're going to leave
the banner onscreen

787
00:30:50,046 --> 00:30:51,176 A:middle
as long as it has an ad.

788
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,816 A:middle
Remember, too, that this is
something that's supposed

789
00:30:53,816 --> 00:30:55,936 A:middle
to be positioned in-line
with your content.

790
00:30:55,986 --> 00:30:58,566 A:middle
When you move it onscreen, when
you leave it onscreen make sure

791
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,666 A:middle
that it's within the
rest of your content.

792

793
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

794
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,666 A:middle
that it's within the
rest of your content.

795
00:31:00,666 --> 00:31:03,656 A:middle
If you have an article and you
put the medium rect onscreen

796
00:31:03,656 --> 00:31:05,446 A:middle
with the article text
should flow around it.

797
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:07,196 A:middle
It should be inside a
scroll view and scroll

798
00:31:07,196 --> 00:31:09,136 A:middle
with the rest of your content.

799
00:31:09,356 --> 00:31:12,536 A:middle
That's what this type
of ad is intended for.

800
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,906 A:middle
You're going to move the
banner back offscreen

801
00:31:16,906 --> 00:31:19,036 A:middle
in bannerView:did
FailToReceive AdWithError.

802
00:31:19,156 --> 00:31:21,076 A:middle
Again, once you move
it offscreen it's your

803
00:31:21,076 --> 00:31:24,786 A:middle
responsibility to reflow
your content to fill the hole

804
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:28,856 A:middle
that was just left by the ad.

805
00:31:28,856 --> 00:31:30,376 A:middle
At that time it's going
to move offscreen.

806
00:31:30,486 --> 00:31:31,646 A:middle
You reflow up your content.

807
00:31:33,596 --> 00:31:35,956 A:middle
This is what banner loading and
unloading is going to look like.

808
00:31:35,956 --> 00:31:37,316 A:middle
You're going -- there's
two important delegate

809
00:31:37,316 --> 00:31:37,956 A:middle
callbacks here.

810
00:31:38,156 --> 00:31:40,686 A:middle
BannerView DidLoadAd in
which case you're just going

811
00:31:40,686 --> 00:31:43,936 A:middle
to put the banner onscreen,
re-handle all of your layout.

812
00:31:44,226 --> 00:31:46,376 A:middle
And bannerViewDidFail
ToReceiveAd WithError you're

813
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,196 A:middle
going to remove it
from the super view.

814
00:31:48,256 --> 00:31:49,316 A:middle
You're going to do the converse.

815
00:31:49,316 --> 00:31:51,736 A:middle
You're going to, again,
layout, reflowing your content

816
00:31:51,736 --> 00:31:53,596 A:middle
around the hole that was
left by the banner view.

817
00:31:55,836 --> 00:31:57,796 A:middle
So some best practices
for medium rectangle.

818
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:00,676 A:middle
Again, this is great
for reflowable content.

819

820
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

821
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:00,676 A:middle
Again, this is great
for reflowable content.

822
00:32:00,676 --> 00:32:02,266 A:middle
This is the sort of
thing that you're going

823
00:32:02,266 --> 00:32:05,776 A:middle
to put inside a scroll view
within the rest of your content

824
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:08,416 A:middle
that may scroll up and
down along the device,

825
00:32:08,566 --> 00:32:09,796 A:middle
may go on- and offscreen.

826
00:32:10,186 --> 00:32:13,136 A:middle
It's sort of static with
the rest of your content,

827
00:32:13,626 --> 00:32:15,436 A:middle
flows around it, fills a hole

828
00:32:15,436 --> 00:32:17,736 A:middle
with inside the space
on the screen.

829
00:32:19,796 --> 00:32:22,446 A:middle
It's got a fullscreen ad
on tap, remember that.

830
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:26,956 A:middle
Pay attention to the delegate
callbacks for willBeginAction,

831
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:30,086 A:middle
didFinishAction so that you
can pause and resume activity.

832
00:32:31,966 --> 00:32:33,956 A:middle
Pause it in bannerViewActions
ShouldBegin.

833
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:38,126 A:middle
And resume activity in
bannerView ActionDidFinish.

834
00:32:39,176 --> 00:32:40,476 A:middle
So that's medium rectangle.

835
00:32:40,476 --> 00:32:43,136 A:middle
A little bit more complicated
than the banner because you have

836
00:32:43,136 --> 00:32:44,466 A:middle
to manage positioning yourself,

837
00:32:44,466 --> 00:32:46,436 A:middle
but still fairly
simple to implement.

838
00:32:48,146 --> 00:32:51,466 A:middle
Okay, the fourth type of
ad that we're going to talk

839
00:32:51,466 --> 00:32:52,966 A:middle
about here is the pre-roll.

840
00:32:53,466 --> 00:32:56,396 A:middle
What is a pre-roll?

841
00:32:56,646 --> 00:33:00,326 A:middle
The video pre-roll is a short
video that plays between --

842

843
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

844
00:32:56,646 --> 00:33:00,326 A:middle
The video pre-roll is a short
video that plays between --

845
00:33:00,326 --> 00:33:02,646 A:middle
before your own media content.

846
00:33:03,116 --> 00:33:08,886 A:middle
It's fullscreen ad on tap just
like the other banner types.

847
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:10,546 A:middle
It was added in iOS 7.

848
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:15,566 A:middle
And in iOS 7 we added it
on MPMoviePlayerController.

849
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:18,056 A:middle
And new in iOS 8
we're also adding it

850
00:33:18,056 --> 00:33:20,966 A:middle
on AVPlayer ViewController,
new AV kit APIs

851
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:22,406 A:middle
that are introduced
here at WWDC.

852
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:27,206 A:middle
This is available on both
iPhone and iPad, and has been

853
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:28,916 A:middle
since the initial introduction.

854
00:33:29,136 --> 00:33:32,826 A:middle
I want to sort of circle back
to the very first bullet here,

855
00:33:32,826 --> 00:33:34,306 A:middle
the short video plays
before content.

856
00:33:34,756 --> 00:33:35,706 A:middle
This is really important.

857
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:38,256 A:middle
This is not an
interstitial-style ad.

858
00:33:38,546 --> 00:33:41,036 A:middle
This is something to be
played before your content,

859
00:33:41,076 --> 00:33:41,976 A:middle
so you need to make sure

860
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:44,606 A:middle
that you actually have a
video to play after it.

861
00:33:44,866 --> 00:33:47,916 A:middle
We don't want -- it's not
supported for you to attempt

862
00:33:47,916 --> 00:33:50,946 A:middle
to use this just to play a
random ad at a random time.

863
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:52,986 A:middle
Make sure that you have
content to follow it,

864
00:33:52,986 --> 00:33:55,286 A:middle
that's what the API
is designed for.

865
00:33:57,496 --> 00:34:00,626 A:middle
So setting up and playback,
also fairly straightforward.

866

867
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

868
00:33:57,496 --> 00:34:00,626 A:middle
So setting up and playback,
also fairly straightforward.

869
00:34:00,626 --> 00:34:01,476 A:middle
You're going to start off

870
00:34:01,516 --> 00:34:03,636 A:middle
by linking the MediaPlayer
and iAd frameworks.

871
00:34:03,996 --> 00:34:05,856 A:middle
You're going to Import
Media and iAd headers.

872
00:34:05,856 --> 00:34:06,986 A:middle
You're going to create a player.

873
00:34:07,056 --> 00:34:09,406 A:middle
You're going to tell it to
play the pre-roll video,

874
00:34:09,406 --> 00:34:10,946 A:middle
and then you'll play
your content video.

875
00:34:11,366 --> 00:34:12,216 A:middle
Very straightforward.

876
00:34:12,496 --> 00:34:14,966 A:middle
Basically almost all
those except the iAd vids

877
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:17,186 A:middle
and the play pre-roll
you already have to do

878
00:34:17,186 --> 00:34:18,536 A:middle
if you've got your own content.

879
00:34:18,636 --> 00:34:21,016 A:middle
This is just a few
tiny additional lines.

880
00:34:21,545 --> 00:34:22,846 A:middle
So what does that look like?

881
00:34:23,065 --> 00:34:25,686 A:middle
First Import MediaPlayer
and Import iAd.

882
00:34:26,146 --> 00:34:29,656 A:middle
You're going to create your
MPMoviePlayerController.

883
00:34:29,846 --> 00:34:30,076 A:middle
You're going

884
00:34:30,076 --> 00:34:31,985 A:middle
to initWithContentURL
as you already would.

885
00:34:31,985 --> 00:34:34,025 A:middle
You're going to add
that MoviePlayer

886
00:34:34,025 --> 00:34:36,396 A:middle
into your view hierarchy
so that it's onscreen.

887
00:34:37,156 --> 00:34:38,746 A:middle
Call layouts, you
redo your layout

888
00:34:38,746 --> 00:34:39,755 A:middle
for it once it's there as well.

889
00:34:40,226 --> 00:34:43,146 A:middle
And then you're going
to call playPrerollAd

890
00:34:43,146 --> 00:34:44,306 A:middle
WithCompletion Handler.

891
00:34:44,306 --> 00:34:45,576 A:middle
You're going to call
this instead

892
00:34:45,576 --> 00:34:47,056 A:middle
of immediately calling Play.

893
00:34:47,056 --> 00:34:50,696 A:middle
This tells iAd, "Hey, try
to put a pre-roll video

894
00:34:50,696 --> 00:34:51,735 A:middle
in there if you've got one.

895
00:34:52,266 --> 00:34:53,376 A:middle
Play that first."

896
00:34:54,416 --> 00:34:55,636 A:middle
This takes a completion handler.

897
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:57,036 A:middle
It's going to return
an error possibly

898
00:34:57,036 --> 00:34:57,926 A:middle
if something went wrong.

899
00:34:58,616 --> 00:35:01,986 A:middle
Inside the completion handler is
your cue to start your content.

900

901
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

902
00:34:58,616 --> 00:35:01,986 A:middle
Inside the completion handler is
your cue to start your content.

903
00:35:02,356 --> 00:35:05,026 A:middle
You want to make sure you don't
automatically play your content.

904
00:35:05,026 --> 00:35:06,216 A:middle
You want to pause your content

905
00:35:06,216 --> 00:35:08,256 A:middle
until this actually
begins playing,

906
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:11,126 A:middle
or until the pre-roll
finishes playing and you want

907
00:35:11,126 --> 00:35:14,306 A:middle
to begin your own content then.

908
00:35:14,306 --> 00:35:15,886 A:middle
For an AVKit it's
almost identical.

909
00:35:15,926 --> 00:35:18,236 A:middle
You're going to create an
AVPlayerViewController instead.

910
00:35:18,236 --> 00:35:19,846 A:middle
You're going to Import
the AVKit headers.

911
00:35:20,356 --> 00:35:22,156 A:middle
And you're going to call, again,

912
00:35:22,156 --> 00:35:23,696 A:middle
playPrerollAd
WithCompletionHandler.

913
00:35:23,696 --> 00:35:25,056 A:middle
It has identical semantics

914
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,986 A:middle
to the MPMediaPlayerController
ones.

915
00:35:27,456 --> 00:35:30,266 A:middle
Inside the completion handler
you're going to call player play

916
00:35:30,266 --> 00:35:33,056 A:middle
to start your own video
content afterward.

917
00:35:33,546 --> 00:35:34,766 A:middle
This is new in iOS 8.

918
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:40,536 A:middle
Just like interstitials, because
this is something that is going

919
00:35:40,536 --> 00:35:43,626 A:middle
to happen at some point and
you want to have iAd prepare it

920
00:35:43,626 --> 00:35:46,056 A:middle
for it you need to tell
the iAd framework, "Hey,

921
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:48,586 A:middle
I'm going to want to play
pre-rolls in the future."

922
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:50,896 A:middle
That allows us to have
the opportunity to go

923
00:35:50,896 --> 00:35:54,656 A:middle
out to the ad server, grab ads,
and be ready for your request

924
00:35:54,656 --> 00:35:56,586 A:middle
to play pre-rolls so that
we can actually play one

925
00:35:56,586 --> 00:35:58,886 A:middle
when the user does
something that requires it.

926
00:35:59,506 --> 00:36:01,766 A:middle
To do that, just like
interstitials you don't want

927

928
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

929
00:35:59,506 --> 00:36:01,766 A:middle
To do that, just like
interstitials you don't want

930
00:36:01,766 --> 00:36:04,006 A:middle
to miss these early impressions,
so you're going to want

931
00:36:04,006 --> 00:36:05,346 A:middle
to start ad requests early

932
00:36:05,726 --> 00:36:07,746 A:middle
by calling
MPMoviePlayerController

933
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:09,146 A:middle
preparePrerollAds.

934
00:36:09,406 --> 00:36:11,626 A:middle
Again, probably an
application did finish launching

935
00:36:11,626 --> 00:36:15,896 A:middle
with options or some other early
in your app's lifecycle period

936
00:36:16,106 --> 00:36:18,216 A:middle
so we haven't had an
opportunity to go get ads

937
00:36:18,216 --> 00:36:20,506 A:middle
for you before you
call the APIs.

938
00:36:21,136 --> 00:36:23,256 A:middle
If you're using AVKit
it's almost identical,

939
00:36:23,506 --> 00:36:26,286 A:middle
AVPlayerController
preparePrerollAds instead.

940
00:36:26,286 --> 00:36:30,656 A:middle
Going with best practices
for video then,

941
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:34,886 A:middle
don't play content video
until the ad completes.

942
00:36:35,886 --> 00:36:38,396 A:middle
If you've called playPrerollAd,

943
00:36:38,626 --> 00:36:42,156 A:middle
and then half a second later you
call Play before we've called

944
00:36:42,156 --> 00:36:45,296 A:middle
your completion handler
we're going to interrupt it.

945
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:49,646 A:middle
You know notification handling
is a very common case for this.

946
00:36:49,646 --> 00:36:52,246 A:middle
This is going to interrupt
playing of the pre-roll ad.

947
00:36:52,246 --> 00:36:53,506 A:middle
It's going to immediately skip.

948
00:36:53,506 --> 00:36:54,646 A:middle
It's going to go
to your content.

949
00:36:54,766 --> 00:36:56,396 A:middle
And it's like the ad
never played except

950
00:36:56,396 --> 00:36:58,376 A:middle
that it's a poor user
experience for your user.

951
00:36:58,376 --> 00:37:00,346 A:middle
You'd like to try to
avoid this when possible.

952

953
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

954
00:36:58,376 --> 00:37:00,346 A:middle
You'd like to try to
avoid this when possible.

955
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:02,366 A:middle
So make sure that you wait

956
00:37:02,366 --> 00:37:04,466 A:middle
until our completion handler
is called to call Play.

957
00:37:04,466 --> 00:37:07,616 A:middle
For notifications this
frequently means just recording

958
00:37:07,616 --> 00:37:09,126 A:middle
the fact that your
content is ready.

959
00:37:09,456 --> 00:37:12,896 A:middle
If you're already calling Play
in these notifications instead

960
00:37:12,966 --> 00:37:16,626 A:middle
of just calling play
record that fact,

961
00:37:16,626 --> 00:37:18,116 A:middle
and inside the completion
handler check

962
00:37:18,116 --> 00:37:19,506 A:middle
for that fact, and
then call play.

963
00:37:20,856 --> 00:37:23,896 A:middle
Similarly defer UI
customization.

964
00:37:23,896 --> 00:37:26,636 A:middle
Many of you may be doing
UI customization on top

965
00:37:26,636 --> 00:37:28,846 A:middle
of the MediaPlayer controller
to present custom controls

966
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:30,486 A:middle
or present custom UI around it.

967
00:37:30,786 --> 00:37:32,286 A:middle
Wait to do that until

968
00:37:32,286 --> 00:37:33,956 A:middle
after we've called your
completion handler.

969
00:37:33,956 --> 00:37:37,306 A:middle
The pre-roll already has
custom UI, and you don't want

970
00:37:37,306 --> 00:37:40,586 A:middle
to interfere with that custom
UI with your own customization.

971
00:37:40,706 --> 00:37:43,496 A:middle
That's, again, going to
provide a very poor experience

972
00:37:43,496 --> 00:37:44,266 A:middle
for your users.

973
00:37:45,546 --> 00:37:48,286 A:middle
Okay, so now that we've
got that let's go back

974
00:37:48,286 --> 00:37:49,356 A:middle
to our demo machine here.

975
00:37:49,356 --> 00:37:52,136 A:middle
I've got a quick demo
setting that up as well.

976
00:37:53,916 --> 00:37:57,656 A:middle
Let's close -- yep -- that.

977
00:37:57,726 --> 00:38:03,446 A:middle
I can pull up quick little
demo of this as well.

978

979
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

980
00:37:57,726 --> 00:38:03,446 A:middle
I can pull up quick little
demo of this as well.

981
00:38:05,106 --> 00:38:06,466 A:middle
Can run this.

982
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:09,396 A:middle
This is a very simple
little app,

983
00:38:09,396 --> 00:38:13,636 A:middle
just provides a few quick
little video clips here.

984
00:38:13,636 --> 00:38:17,066 A:middle
I can click on one of these
and we've got a quick video.

985
00:38:17,446 --> 00:38:20,116 A:middle
Now what I'd like to do is now
that I've got this video content

986
00:38:20,116 --> 00:38:21,616 A:middle
that my user would
like to engage with I'd

987
00:38:21,616 --> 00:38:25,066 A:middle
like to monetize this by
playing a pre-roll ad prior

988
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:27,476 A:middle
to the user actually being
able to view my clips.

989
00:38:27,966 --> 00:38:30,426 A:middle
So let's go ahead and quit
this and see what we have

990
00:38:30,426 --> 00:38:31,436 A:middle
to do to get that done.

991
00:38:32,626 --> 00:38:35,456 A:middle
We can start off here --
the very first thing we need

992
00:38:35,456 --> 00:38:38,236 A:middle
to do is, as for interstitials,
we want to make sure

993
00:38:38,236 --> 00:38:39,016 A:middle
that we tell iAd, "Hey,

994
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:42,566 A:middle
I'm going to be playing pre-roll
ads, go fetch them early."

995
00:38:42,856 --> 00:38:44,806 A:middle
We'll start off in
our app delegate here,

996
00:38:47,056 --> 00:38:53,496 A:middle
and we will Import iAd, and
we'll Import the MediaPlayer

997
00:38:53,496 --> 00:38:55,776 A:middle
so we have the appropriate
classes for our APIs.

998
00:38:56,206 --> 00:38:59,656 A:middle
And we'll go ahead and
call preparePrerollAds

999
00:38:59,656 --> 00:39:00,986 A:middle
on MPMoviePlayerController.

1000

1001
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1002
00:38:59,656 --> 00:39:00,986 A:middle
on MPMoviePlayerController.

1003
00:39:01,956 --> 00:39:04,286 A:middle
Once we've done that we
need to actually go ahead

1004
00:39:04,286 --> 00:39:06,256 A:middle
and call preparePrerollAds,

1005
00:39:06,256 --> 00:39:08,106 A:middle
so we'll go to our
View Controller here

1006
00:39:08,106 --> 00:39:11,226 A:middle
which is doing the actual
display, and we're going

1007
00:39:11,226 --> 00:39:14,666 A:middle
to scroll down to at the
bottom here collectionView

1008
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:16,736 A:middle
didSelectItemAtIndexPath.

1009
00:39:17,016 --> 00:39:19,296 A:middle
This is what happens when
the user actually taps on it.

1010
00:39:19,596 --> 00:39:22,086 A:middle
At the moment all
we're doing is creating

1011
00:39:22,086 --> 00:39:25,236 A:middle
MPMoviePlayerViewController,
setting the content URL,

1012
00:39:25,236 --> 00:39:26,766 A:middle
and then calling
Present MoviePlayer

1013
00:39:26,766 --> 00:39:28,216 A:middle
to have it start
playing automatically.

1014
00:39:28,946 --> 00:39:30,996 A:middle
We want to sort of
interrupt that briefly,

1015
00:39:30,996 --> 00:39:32,636 A:middle
and instead we're
going to go ahead

1016
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:37,386 A:middle
and call playPrerollAd
WithCompletionHandler.

1017
00:39:37,826 --> 00:39:39,816 A:middle
And again, inside the
completion handler to that,

1018
00:39:39,966 --> 00:39:43,456 A:middle
that's where we're going to call
mpvController .moviePlayer play.

1019
00:39:44,196 --> 00:39:48,766 A:middle
Go back up to the top here, and
ensure that we are importing iAd

1020
00:39:48,766 --> 00:39:52,186 A:middle
as well, so we get the
iAd APIs available.

1021
00:39:52,186 --> 00:39:54,266 A:middle
Go ahead and save that.

1022
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:56,386 A:middle
We can run again.

1023
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:03,016 A:middle
No. This is what I
knew I was going to do.

1024

1025
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1026
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:03,016 A:middle
No. This is what I
knew I was going to do.

1027
00:40:03,706 --> 00:40:05,076 A:middle
Once again, we got
to go in here,

1028
00:40:05,076 --> 00:40:06,976 A:middle
make sure that the iAd
framework is linked.

1029
00:40:14,046 --> 00:40:15,186 A:middle
Now we can run it.

1030
00:40:16,286 --> 00:40:20,256 A:middle
Okay, and we got our ad up
-- our app up here again,

1031
00:40:20,256 --> 00:40:22,156 A:middle
same quick little videos.

1032
00:40:22,536 --> 00:40:24,506 A:middle
We can go ahead and click
on one of these now.

1033
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:28,766 A:middle
And before the video content
actually plays you see

1034
00:40:28,766 --> 00:40:32,366 A:middle
that we've got an iAd workbench
ad that comes up instead.

1035
00:40:32,366 --> 00:40:36,236 A:middle
The user can view
this ad content.

1036
00:40:36,236 --> 00:40:37,996 A:middle
Once they're done with it
they can decide to go ahead

1037
00:40:37,996 --> 00:40:40,216 A:middle
and skip ahead of it, and
we go immediately back

1038
00:40:40,276 --> 00:40:42,956 A:middle
to the video content
for the app itself.

1039
00:40:43,186 --> 00:40:46,826 A:middle
And that's pretty much
all that's involved

1040
00:40:46,826 --> 00:40:50,996 A:middle
in implementing pre-rolls once
you've already got MediaPlayer

1041
00:40:50,996 --> 00:40:53,436 A:middle
content for that pre-roll
to play in front of.

1042
00:40:54,546 --> 00:40:59,246 A:middle
Okay, so those are the
four different types of ads

1043
00:40:59,246 --> 00:41:01,976 A:middle
that we have for integration
with iAd inside your app.

1044

1045
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1046
00:40:59,246 --> 00:41:01,976 A:middle
that we have for integration
with iAd inside your app.

1047
00:41:02,486 --> 00:41:04,716 A:middle
Once you've started using
them let's talk a little bit

1048
00:41:04,716 --> 00:41:05,356 A:middle
about testing.

1049
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:10,166 A:middle
First of all there are a
couple of things we add --

1050
00:41:10,316 --> 00:41:13,226 A:middle
we've added to the developer
settings on the phone

1051
00:41:13,286 --> 00:41:17,166 A:middle
to help you test the integration
of iAd within your app.

1052
00:41:18,036 --> 00:41:20,246 A:middle
First, you can adjust
the fill rate.

1053
00:41:20,816 --> 00:41:25,216 A:middle
This is inside the apps that you
have when you're testing them

1054
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,896 A:middle
on the device you can adjust
how frequently you're going

1055
00:41:27,896 --> 00:41:28,566 A:middle
to get ads.

1056
00:41:28,566 --> 00:41:30,476 A:middle
This allows you to
test error conditions.

1057
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:32,836 A:middle
It allows you to test always
working conditions and make sure

1058
00:41:32,836 --> 00:41:35,516 A:middle
that your app handles those
conditions appropriately.

1059
00:41:36,746 --> 00:41:39,776 A:middle
In addition you can adjust
the refresh rate for things

1060
00:41:39,776 --> 00:41:41,406 A:middle
like banners and medium rects.

1061
00:41:41,406 --> 00:41:42,876 A:middle
This is going to
adjust the frequency

1062
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:44,436 A:middle
with which new ads come in.

1063
00:41:45,116 --> 00:41:49,036 A:middle
In addition, in combination with
the fill rate this allows you

1064
00:41:49,036 --> 00:41:50,676 A:middle
to rapidly test error

1065
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:53,786 A:middle
and non-error conditions moving
things on- and offscreen.

1066
00:41:57,676 --> 00:42:00,226 A:middle
Most importantly there's
a switch called Highlight

1067

1068
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1069
00:41:57,676 --> 00:42:00,226 A:middle
Most importantly there's
a switch called Highlight

1070
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,016 A:middle
Clipped Banners.

1071
00:42:01,316 --> 00:42:04,996 A:middle
If you're using the
.canDisplayBannerAds this isn't

1072
00:42:04,996 --> 00:42:06,216 A:middle
going to affect banners
very much,

1073
00:42:06,216 --> 00:42:08,366 A:middle
but this is very
important for medium rect.

1074
00:42:09,116 --> 00:42:12,486 A:middle
It's very easy to accident
occlude part of the medium rect

1075
00:42:12,486 --> 00:42:14,376 A:middle
with some other UI element.

1076
00:42:14,426 --> 00:42:17,356 A:middle
If you do that that's a
part of the medium rect

1077
00:42:17,356 --> 00:42:18,796 A:middle
that may not be seen
by your user.

1078
00:42:19,056 --> 00:42:20,516 A:middle
It's a part of the
medium rect that you --

1079
00:42:20,516 --> 00:42:23,156 A:middle
that the user may not be able
to tap on and interact with.

1080
00:42:23,266 --> 00:42:25,336 A:middle
This will detect that.

1081
00:42:25,926 --> 00:42:27,856 A:middle
You turn on the Highlight
Clipped Banners button.

1082
00:42:27,856 --> 00:42:30,246 A:middle
We're going to provide
a green or a red overlay

1083
00:42:30,556 --> 00:42:33,616 A:middle
over your medium rect, or
banners, or instructions

1084
00:42:33,616 --> 00:42:37,006 A:middle
for that matter, that will show
when the user can actually tap

1085
00:42:37,006 --> 00:42:38,406 A:middle
on all parts of this banner

1086
00:42:38,636 --> 00:42:41,176 A:middle
when it is officially
onscreen and visible.

1087
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:43,136 A:middle
You want to make
sure that any banners

1088
00:42:43,136 --> 00:42:45,426 A:middle
that you show inside your
app are always green.

1089
00:42:45,426 --> 00:42:52,456 A:middle
Remember this only affects your
apps, your developer-mode apps

1090
00:42:52,456 --> 00:42:55,696 A:middle
that you have run from xCode
and deployed onto your device.

1091
00:42:55,696 --> 00:42:57,926 A:middle
So no, you can't just
fill right to zero

1092
00:42:57,926 --> 00:43:00,276 A:middle
for all the other iAd-using
apps on your device.

1093

1094
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1095
00:42:57,926 --> 00:43:00,276 A:middle
for all the other iAd-using
apps on your device.

1096
00:43:00,276 --> 00:43:02,376 A:middle
This only affects
developer-mode apps.

1097
00:43:02,896 --> 00:43:06,656 A:middle
Okay, so that's monetization.

1098
00:43:06,656 --> 00:43:09,006 A:middle
That was sort of the first
major portion of the talk.

1099
00:43:09,006 --> 00:43:11,226 A:middle
Let's talk next a little
bit about promotion.

1100
00:43:11,226 --> 00:43:13,946 A:middle
This is the other half
of the iAd ecosystem.

1101
00:43:14,046 --> 00:43:18,986 A:middle
This is how you can use iAd to
drive downloads of your own app.

1102
00:43:19,226 --> 00:43:21,606 A:middle
So there's three major parts

1103
00:43:22,636 --> 00:43:24,856 A:middle
that we're going
to talk about here.

1104
00:43:24,856 --> 00:43:27,716 A:middle
First I'm going to do a really
quick intro to iA Workbench.

1105
00:43:27,716 --> 00:43:29,126 A:middle
There's another session
on that tomorrow

1106
00:43:29,126 --> 00:43:30,156 A:middle
if you get more in detail.

1107
00:43:30,156 --> 00:43:31,396 A:middle
So this is just a
quick overview.

1108
00:43:31,886 --> 00:43:35,426 A:middle
And then there are two new APIs
that we're introducing in iOS 8,

1109
00:43:35,576 --> 00:43:39,486 A:middle
one for app attribution and one
for app audience retargeting.

1110
00:43:39,486 --> 00:43:42,406 A:middle
And we'll talk a little
bit about those new APIs.

1111
00:43:42,406 --> 00:43:44,436 A:middle
Let's start off with
iAd Workbench.

1112
00:43:45,596 --> 00:43:46,616 A:middle
What is iAd Workbench?

1113
00:43:46,856 --> 00:43:48,806 A:middle
iAd Workbench is
iAd's self-servicing

1114
00:43:48,806 --> 00:43:50,246 A:middle
advertising platform.

1115
00:43:50,346 --> 00:43:53,306 A:middle
It's basically a Web
app on the apple.com,

1116
00:43:53,306 --> 00:43:55,046 A:middle
iadworkbench.apple.com.

1117
00:43:55,356 --> 00:43:59,506 A:middle
This is how you can manage
being an advertiser on iAd.

1118
00:43:59,776 --> 00:44:02,136 A:middle
Okay, you can create mobile ads.

1119

1120
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1121
00:43:59,776 --> 00:44:02,136 A:middle
Okay, you can create mobile ads.

1122
00:44:02,446 --> 00:44:03,726 A:middle
You can upload your own banners.

1123
00:44:03,726 --> 00:44:05,196 A:middle
You can use built-in templates.

1124
00:44:05,196 --> 00:44:10,026 A:middle
You can also use iProducer to
create your own iAd assets.

1125
00:44:11,456 --> 00:44:14,526 A:middle
Once you've done that you can
use this to reach the users

1126
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:17,006 A:middle
who are most likely to
actually download your app.

1127
00:44:17,436 --> 00:44:19,516 A:middle
iAd is an iOS advertising
platform.

1128
00:44:19,516 --> 00:44:22,366 A:middle
You're going to reach a whole
bunch of users who are on iOS

1129
00:44:22,366 --> 00:44:25,826 A:middle
who are already using apps on
iOS and who are, therefore,

1130
00:44:25,826 --> 00:44:29,526 A:middle
highly likely to engage with the
ad that is advertising your app

1131
00:44:29,526 --> 00:44:30,656 A:middle
and download your app.

1132
00:44:30,806 --> 00:44:34,366 A:middle
You can also manage your
campaign performance here.

1133
00:44:34,366 --> 00:44:35,036 A:middle
This is where you're going

1134
00:44:35,036 --> 00:44:37,106 A:middle
to see how many people
have seen your ad,

1135
00:44:37,106 --> 00:44:39,936 A:middle
how the campaign is doing,
tap-through rates, etcetera,

1136
00:44:39,936 --> 00:44:41,836 A:middle
for your particular
advertising campaign.

1137
00:44:42,986 --> 00:44:44,176 A:middle
So that's Workbench.

1138
00:44:44,176 --> 00:44:44,656 A:middle
Again, there's going

1139
00:44:44,656 --> 00:44:46,826 A:middle
to be another session
tomorrow go into more detail.

1140
00:44:47,306 --> 00:44:50,106 A:middle
Next important part to
talk about is some new APIs

1141
00:44:50,106 --> 00:44:52,166 A:middle
that we've got for
app attribution.

1142
00:44:52,686 --> 00:44:54,796 A:middle
Okay, what is app attribution?

1143
00:44:55,646 --> 00:44:58,806 A:middle
App attribution allows you to
track app downloads of your app

1144
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:00,296 A:middle
that originated from iAd.

1145

1146
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1147
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:00,296 A:middle
that originated from iAd.

1148
00:45:00,296 --> 00:45:04,186 A:middle
Okay, this is going to let
you measure the effectiveness

1149
00:45:04,186 --> 00:45:06,606 A:middle
of your campaigns that you've
created in iAd Workbench

1150
00:45:06,606 --> 00:45:09,246 A:middle
that you're running to
actually promote your app.

1151
00:45:09,446 --> 00:45:16,106 A:middle
Okay, the APIs were available
in iOS 7 -- or iOS 7.1, rather.

1152
00:45:16,586 --> 00:45:19,216 A:middle
And we've enhanced them a
little bit in iOS 8 as well.

1153
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,736 A:middle
So there's a new one in iOS 8.

1154
00:45:21,426 --> 00:45:23,396 A:middle
So what does the API
actually look like?

1155
00:45:23,396 --> 00:45:24,166 A:middle
It's very simple.

1156
00:45:24,296 --> 00:45:26,676 A:middle
Again, you're going
to Include iAd/iAd.h

1157
00:45:26,676 --> 00:45:28,086 A:middle
as everything starts
with for iAd.

1158
00:45:28,646 --> 00:45:32,316 A:middle
And then you're going to
call ADClient sharedClient.

1159
00:45:32,316 --> 00:45:35,726 A:middle
And on that you're going to
call lookupAdConversionDetails.

1160
00:45:36,026 --> 00:45:40,366 A:middle
Okay, inside that you can use
the two dates that are provided

1161
00:45:40,366 --> 00:45:42,686 A:middle
with completion handler
to determine whether

1162
00:45:42,686 --> 00:45:44,926 A:middle
or not this particular
installation

1163
00:45:44,926 --> 00:45:46,826 A:middle
of the app was due to iAd.

1164
00:45:46,826 --> 00:45:49,526 A:middle
Okay, these dates are going
to give you two things.

1165
00:45:49,896 --> 00:45:52,266 A:middle
The first is the app
purchase date on the date

1166
00:45:52,266 --> 00:45:54,836 A:middle
at which the user actually
made the purchase of this app.

1167
00:45:55,496 --> 00:45:57,916 A:middle
And then the date
of the impression,

1168
00:45:57,916 --> 00:46:01,616 A:middle
the date that the user saw and
interacted with the ad prior

1169

1170
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1171
00:45:57,916 --> 00:46:01,616 A:middle
the date that the user saw and
interacted with the ad prior

1172
00:46:01,616 --> 00:46:03,276 A:middle
to them purchasing the app.

1173
00:46:03,776 --> 00:46:07,756 A:middle
Okay, if both of these dates
are there and true that's going

1174
00:46:07,756 --> 00:46:09,046 A:middle
to indicate to you that as far

1175
00:46:09,046 --> 00:46:11,876 A:middle
as iAd is concerned
this was a installation

1176
00:46:11,876 --> 00:46:13,556 A:middle
of your app directly
attributable

1177
00:46:13,556 --> 00:46:14,926 A:middle
to the user interacting with

1178
00:46:14,926 --> 00:46:17,536 A:middle
and seeing an iAd
promoting your app.

1179
00:46:22,616 --> 00:46:24,426 A:middle
It's very important to remember
that these dates are going

1180
00:46:24,426 --> 00:46:27,946 A:middle
to be nil if they are
not attributed to iAd.

1181
00:46:28,826 --> 00:46:31,936 A:middle
They'll also be nil if the user
has Limit Ad Tracking enabled.

1182
00:46:31,936 --> 00:46:33,246 A:middle
So regardless of whether

1183
00:46:33,246 --> 00:46:37,026 A:middle
or not this is an iAd-driven
installation the user has Limit

1184
00:46:37,026 --> 00:46:39,626 A:middle
Ad Tracking enabled; they don't
want their ad browsing data

1185
00:46:39,976 --> 00:46:42,816 A:middle
to be tracked or
shown to various apps.

1186
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:43,836 A:middle
These are going to be nil.

1187
00:46:43,836 --> 00:46:45,646 A:middle
We're not going to give you
this information in those cases.

1188
00:46:45,646 --> 00:46:47,576 A:middle
So you should be aware of that
if you're trying to use this

1189
00:46:47,576 --> 00:46:48,716 A:middle
for any sort of analytics.

1190
00:46:49,976 --> 00:46:52,546 A:middle
In addition you want
to avoid lookups

1191
00:46:52,546 --> 00:46:53,926 A:middle
of this data on every launch.

1192
00:46:53,926 --> 00:46:56,046 A:middle
It's probably very
tempting to add this

1193
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:58,886 A:middle
to appDidFinishLaunching,
lookup your conversion details,

1194
00:46:58,886 --> 00:47:00,456 A:middle
set some state flag,
and do something

1195

1196
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1197
00:46:58,886 --> 00:47:00,456 A:middle
set some state flag,
and do something

1198
00:47:00,456 --> 00:47:01,806 A:middle
on every single launch
on the app.

1199
00:47:02,066 --> 00:47:03,336 A:middle
Try to avoid doing that.

1200
00:47:03,686 --> 00:47:06,136 A:middle
There is some cost to
actually doing this lookup.

1201
00:47:06,466 --> 00:47:08,836 A:middle
You want to defer doing this
lookup until you actually need

1202
00:47:08,836 --> 00:47:11,196 A:middle
to and then cache
the data afterward.

1203
00:47:11,196 --> 00:47:14,356 A:middle
Okay, so that's app attribution.

1204
00:47:14,356 --> 00:47:15,976 A:middle
The next thing we can talk

1205
00:47:15,976 --> 00:47:18,876 A:middle
about is the app
audience retargeting APIs.

1206
00:47:19,066 --> 00:47:20,856 A:middle
These are new APIs in iOS 8.

1207
00:47:21,166 --> 00:47:24,986 A:middle
So what is app audience
retargeting to begin with?

1208
00:47:25,186 --> 00:47:28,586 A:middle
Audience retargeting allows you
to group the users of your app,

1209
00:47:28,666 --> 00:47:32,686 A:middle
that particular audience, into
various categories depending

1210
00:47:32,686 --> 00:47:35,676 A:middle
on their activity within your
app, or things that you know

1211
00:47:35,676 --> 00:47:37,766 A:middle
about them from their
use of your app.

1212
00:47:39,706 --> 00:47:41,836 A:middle
This might be frequent
in-app purchases.

1213
00:47:42,496 --> 00:47:45,116 A:middle
It might be a very high
usage rate relative

1214
00:47:45,116 --> 00:47:46,426 A:middle
to other users within your app.

1215
00:47:47,016 --> 00:47:49,976 A:middle
It might be dormant users, users
who used your app a while ago

1216
00:47:49,976 --> 00:47:51,456 A:middle
but you haven't seen in a while.

1217
00:47:53,196 --> 00:47:56,696 A:middle
You can then use this
information to target new ads

1218
00:47:56,696 --> 00:48:01,086 A:middle
in iAd Workbench directly at
specific subgroups of your users

1219

1220
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1221
00:47:56,696 --> 00:48:01,086 A:middle
in iAd Workbench directly at
specific subgroups of your users

1222
00:48:01,276 --> 00:48:06,476 A:middle
to reach specific audiences
within the users of your app.

1223
00:48:06,726 --> 00:48:09,516 A:middle
Each group defines
what we call a segment.

1224
00:48:09,896 --> 00:48:11,156 A:middle
That's terminology
that's going to come

1225
00:48:11,156 --> 00:48:12,226 A:middle
up in the next couple of slides.

1226
00:48:12,226 --> 00:48:13,126 A:middle
That's important to know.

1227
00:48:13,466 --> 00:48:15,696 A:middle
A specific group of
your users is a --

1228
00:48:15,806 --> 00:48:18,746 A:middle
with a specific name
is a segment.

1229
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:23,586 A:middle
So why would you
want to use this?

1230
00:48:24,236 --> 00:48:25,756 A:middle
Let's say you're a
game app developer.

1231
00:48:26,976 --> 00:48:29,266 A:middle
You want to promote the
new iAd version of your app

1232
00:48:29,266 --> 00:48:31,006 A:middle
to all your iPhone users.

1233
00:48:31,086 --> 00:48:34,306 A:middle
You want to go back and reach
those specific users and say,

1234
00:48:34,306 --> 00:48:37,876 A:middle
"Hey, I've got a great
new iPad version of it.

1235
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:38,626 A:middle
Come try it again.

1236
00:48:38,626 --> 00:48:40,946 A:middle
Come back to this app,
maybe re-download it."

1237
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:45,316 A:middle
If there's new features
that affect specific subsets

1238
00:48:45,316 --> 00:48:49,056 A:middle
of your app you can use this
to reach those specific users.

1239
00:48:49,436 --> 00:48:51,656 A:middle
That's going to ensure that
the ads you create are going

1240
00:48:51,656 --> 00:48:53,786 A:middle
to reach precisely the
audience you're attempting

1241
00:48:53,786 --> 00:48:58,426 A:middle
to target with those ads.

1242
00:48:58,426 --> 00:49:00,536 A:middle
Similarly you can
reengage dormant users.

1243

1244
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1245
00:48:58,426 --> 00:49:00,536 A:middle
Similarly you can
reengage dormant users.

1246
00:49:00,536 --> 00:49:02,206 A:middle
If you've got users
that you haven't seen

1247
00:49:02,206 --> 00:49:05,296 A:middle
in a while you can craft a
message specifically designed

1248
00:49:05,296 --> 00:49:07,206 A:middle
to try to pull those
people back into your app

1249
00:49:07,416 --> 00:49:09,906 A:middle
to reengage those uses who
may not have used your app

1250
00:49:09,906 --> 00:49:10,486 A:middle
in some time.

1251
00:49:12,696 --> 00:49:15,336 A:middle
If you're a retail app
instead there's similar reasons

1252
00:49:15,336 --> 00:49:16,106 A:middle
to use this.

1253
00:49:16,726 --> 00:49:19,326 A:middle
It can remind users who may
have abandoned a shopping cart

1254
00:49:19,326 --> 00:49:22,486 A:middle
in your app, segment those into
something, send them a message,

1255
00:49:22,586 --> 00:49:24,296 A:middle
"Hey, you abandoned
your shopping cart.

1256
00:49:24,296 --> 00:49:26,816 A:middle
Maybe you should come back
and reengage with this app.

1257
00:49:26,846 --> 00:49:28,556 A:middle
Maybe you still want to
purchase those things."

1258
00:49:29,346 --> 00:49:31,576 A:middle
If you've got loyal
customers maybe you want

1259
00:49:31,576 --> 00:49:32,536 A:middle
to send them a special offer.

1260
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:34,686 A:middle
Maybe you want to send them a
gift for being a loyal customer,

1261
00:49:34,966 --> 00:49:36,666 A:middle
you can do that with
an ad as well.

1262
00:49:36,666 --> 00:49:41,296 A:middle
You can retarget specific ads to
specific segments of your users.

1263
00:49:41,956 --> 00:49:44,816 A:middle
If they've -- you
can group customers

1264
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:47,366 A:middle
into specific categories based
on their previous purchases.

1265
00:49:47,366 --> 00:49:49,856 A:middle
You can promote sales based
on their previous purchases.

1266
00:49:49,976 --> 00:49:53,146 A:middle
All these are done by segmenting
those users into specific groups

1267
00:49:53,676 --> 00:49:56,486 A:middle
and recording that so
that you can reengage

1268
00:49:56,486 --> 00:49:58,166 A:middle
with those users
with specific ads.

1269
00:49:58,256 --> 00:49:59,976 A:middle
So how does this actually work?

1270

1271
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1272
00:50:00,046 --> 00:50:02,506 A:middle
First thing you're going
to do is you're going to go

1273
00:50:02,506 --> 00:50:05,406 A:middle
on iAd Workbench, and you're
going to create segments.

1274
00:50:05,646 --> 00:50:07,586 A:middle
And you're going to tell
iAd Workbench, "Hey,

1275
00:50:07,586 --> 00:50:09,756 A:middle
I'm going to group these people
into 10 different segments.

1276
00:50:10,066 --> 00:50:12,536 A:middle
Please give me some segment
identifiers to use for that."

1277
00:50:12,816 --> 00:50:14,846 A:middle
It's important to notice that
you do not create segment --

1278
00:50:14,846 --> 00:50:17,816 A:middle
specific segment identifiers;
iAd Workbench does instead,

1279
00:50:17,816 --> 00:50:20,306 A:middle
and this is partially
for privacy reasons.

1280
00:50:20,306 --> 00:50:22,656 A:middle
We manage the specific
segment identifiers.

1281
00:50:23,556 --> 00:50:25,676 A:middle
Once you've done that
you're going to go ahead

1282
00:50:25,676 --> 00:50:27,956 A:middle
and update your app and take
advantage of the new APIs,

1283
00:50:27,956 --> 00:50:30,516 A:middle
so you can actually
associate specific segments

1284
00:50:30,516 --> 00:50:31,936 A:middle
with specific users.

1285
00:50:32,036 --> 00:50:33,136 A:middle
And that goes up to the server

1286
00:50:33,136 --> 00:50:34,926 A:middle
so we can actually
record that information.

1287
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,596 A:middle
Once that's done you go
back to iAd Workbench,

1288
00:50:38,626 --> 00:50:41,376 A:middle
and you create your
new Workbench campaign

1289
00:50:41,686 --> 00:50:45,466 A:middle
to retarget those customers
with some specific ad message.

1290
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:49,576 A:middle
Okay, so how do you
actually do this?

1291
00:50:49,576 --> 00:50:51,216 A:middle
Actually very simple
on the client side.

1292
00:50:51,646 --> 00:50:52,986 A:middle
You're going to Include iAd.

1293
00:50:54,206 --> 00:50:56,386 A:middle
You're going to create
an array of segments,

1294
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,646 A:middle
and these are segments --

1295
00:50:57,806 --> 00:51:00,486 A:middle
the segment identifiers are
what you've already gotten

1296

1297
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1298
00:50:57,806 --> 00:51:00,486 A:middle
the segment identifiers are
what you've already gotten

1299
00:51:00,486 --> 00:51:01,386 A:middle
from Workbench.

1300
00:51:01,386 --> 00:51:03,476 A:middle
If you attempt to send
random segment identifiers

1301
00:51:03,476 --> 00:51:05,506 A:middle
up to iAd we're just
going to ignore them,

1302
00:51:05,506 --> 00:51:07,026 A:middle
so you want to make sure
you're using the ones

1303
00:51:07,026 --> 00:51:09,696 A:middle
that you've already created
and set up inside Workbench.

1304
00:51:10,036 --> 00:51:13,346 A:middle
So maybe you decided you know
Segment A is loyal users,

1305
00:51:13,346 --> 00:51:15,816 A:middle
Segment B is frequent
purchases, and you want

1306
00:51:15,816 --> 00:51:18,316 A:middle
to associate the current
user with those two segments.

1307
00:51:18,316 --> 00:51:19,866 A:middle
And you go ahead and
create a segment array

1308
00:51:19,866 --> 00:51:20,926 A:middle
with those segments in it.

1309
00:51:21,436 --> 00:51:24,226 A:middle
And you're going to call
ADClient sharedClient,

1310
00:51:24,226 --> 00:51:28,226 A:middle
addClientToSegments,
replaceExisting.

1311
00:51:28,226 --> 00:51:31,496 A:middle
This is by default with
replaceExisting:NO going

1312
00:51:31,496 --> 00:51:34,316 A:middle
to add these segments
to the current user.

1313
00:51:34,316 --> 00:51:37,126 A:middle
If instead you'd like to
say, "Hey, these are all

1314
00:51:37,126 --> 00:51:38,766 A:middle
of the segments I'd like
to associate the user,"

1315
00:51:39,116 --> 00:51:41,386 A:middle
which might also allow
you to remove old segments

1316
00:51:41,386 --> 00:51:44,306 A:middle
from the user, you can just
update that replaceExisting

1317
00:51:44,306 --> 00:51:47,056 A:middle
to yes to just completely
replace the old set

1318
00:51:47,226 --> 00:51:48,116 A:middle
with the new set.

1319
00:51:50,456 --> 00:51:55,466 A:middle
Okay, so that's basically iAd
for promotion, the new APIs

1320
00:51:55,466 --> 00:51:56,836 A:middle
that we've added in iOS 8.

1321
00:51:57,346 --> 00:51:58,526 A:middle
So what did we learn?

00:52:00,406 --> 00:52:02,696 A:middle
First of all, there's some
best practices for using iAd.

1325
00:52:02,996 --> 00:52:04,896 A:middle
There are four different types
of banners that we've talked --

1326
00:52:04,896 --> 00:52:06,526 A:middle
four different types of ads
that we've talked about.

1327
00:52:06,526 --> 00:52:07,116 A:middle
There's a banner.

1328
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:08,446 A:middle
There's an interstitial.

1329
00:52:09,016 --> 00:52:09,956 A:middle
There's a medium rect.

1330
00:52:10,196 --> 00:52:12,876 A:middle
And there's a pre-roll, and
they all have their place.

1331
00:52:13,216 --> 00:52:15,936 A:middle
You want to take advantage
of the different ad formats

1332
00:52:15,936 --> 00:52:19,086 A:middle
that we've given to you,
think about where they belong

1333
00:52:19,086 --> 00:52:22,306 A:middle
in your app, and make sure
you use the appropriate ad

1334
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:23,706 A:middle
for the appropriate context.

1335
00:52:24,086 --> 00:52:27,406 A:middle
As part of that consider the
user when you're placing ads.

1336
00:52:27,976 --> 00:52:31,746 A:middle
Yes, ads are very valuable
for generating revenue

1337
00:52:31,746 --> 00:52:34,216 A:middle
from your app, and iAd can
help a lot with doing that.

1338
00:52:34,856 --> 00:52:39,596 A:middle
But great revenue and great apps
start with great users as well.

1339
00:52:39,596 --> 00:52:41,566 A:middle
If you're going to
alienate all of your users

1340
00:52:41,676 --> 00:52:46,216 A:middle
by poor ad placement, by poor ad
choice you're not actually going

1341
00:52:46,216 --> 00:52:46,886 A:middle
to have a net win here.

1342
00:52:47,196 --> 00:52:50,216 A:middle
You want to really make sure
you have a user-centric focus

1343
00:52:50,426 --> 00:52:52,346 A:middle
to where you're picking
to put ads

1344
00:52:52,346 --> 00:52:54,566 A:middle
and which type you're
choosing to put there.

1345
00:52:56,916 --> 00:53:00,636 A:middle
In addition, there's
a cycle here

1348
00:52:56,916 --> 00:53:00,636 A:middle
In addition, there's
a cycle here

1349
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:02,946 A:middle
between monetization
and promotion.

1350
00:53:03,216 --> 00:53:06,496 A:middle
Okay, optimize your ad's
performance to begin --

1351
00:53:06,496 --> 00:53:08,856 A:middle
your app's ad performance
to begin with, that's going

1352
00:53:08,856 --> 00:53:10,066 A:middle
to generate revenue from it.

1353
00:53:10,976 --> 00:53:12,856 A:middle
But don't forget to take
advantage of iAd Workbench

1354
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,646 A:middle
and re-promote your app.

1355
00:53:14,646 --> 00:53:17,976 A:middle
It's important to continue
to get new users for your app

1356
00:53:17,976 --> 00:53:20,276 A:middle
if you want to continue to
get revenue from your app.

1357
00:53:20,886 --> 00:53:22,096 A:middle
The two feed into each other.

1358
00:53:22,096 --> 00:53:24,156 A:middle
You want to generate revenue;
you want to spend some

1359
00:53:24,156 --> 00:53:26,876 A:middle
of your revenue to re-advertise
your app and acquire new users.

1360
00:53:27,346 --> 00:53:32,026 A:middle
Okay, so those are some sort
of best practices for iAd.

1361
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:36,296 A:middle
For more information beyond this
we've got Mark Malone is our iAd

1362
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,546 A:middle
Technologies Evangelist.

1363
00:53:37,546 --> 00:53:39,366 A:middle
You can reach him at
the email address above.

1364
00:53:40,046 --> 00:53:42,996 A:middle
There's an iAd Programming
Guide online along

1365
00:53:42,996 --> 00:53:45,896 A:middle
with the iOS STK
developer information.

1366
00:53:46,646 --> 00:53:48,906 A:middle
There's some Apple developer
forums that we monitor.

1367
00:53:48,906 --> 00:53:51,666 A:middle
If you've got questions,
you and other developers,

1368
00:53:51,666 --> 00:53:53,696 A:middle
and us will be monitoring
those to answer questions,

1369
00:53:53,696 --> 00:53:54,526 A:middle
hopefully help you out.

1370
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:58,336 A:middle
There are a couple related
sessions here at WWCC.

1371
00:53:58,336 --> 00:54:00,596 A:middle

Unfortunately you already
missed The New iTunes Connect

1375
00:54:00,596 --> 00:54:01,916 A:middle
which talked a little
bit about iAd.

1376
00:54:02,116 --> 00:54:03,076 A:middle
That was yesterday.

1377
00:54:03,296 --> 00:54:04,256 A:middle
You can watch the video.

1378
00:54:04,656 --> 00:54:07,346 A:middle
Tomorrow morning at 9:00 in
Nob Hill there's What's New

1379
00:54:07,346 --> 00:54:08,886 A:middle
in iAd Workbench
which is going to go

1380
00:54:08,886 --> 00:54:11,546 A:middle
into a little bit more detail
about the app attribution

1381
00:54:11,546 --> 00:54:13,456 A:middle
and the audience segment
retargeting that I talked

1382
00:54:13,456 --> 00:54:15,286 A:middle
about at the end of
this presentation.

1383
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:16,556 A:middle
And that's it.

1384
00:54:16,826 --> 00:54:17,566 A:middle
Thank you very much.
