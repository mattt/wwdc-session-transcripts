00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:23,116 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: Good morning, and
welcome to Accessibility on iOS,

2
00:00:23,386 --> 00:00:25,626 A:middle
my name is Ian Fisch
and I'm an engineer

3
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,056 A:middle
on the Accessibility team.

4
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:31,866 A:middle
So accessibility is really
about making sure all users,

5
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:34,916 A:middle
regardless of abilities,
have full access to all

6
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:37,516 A:middle
of our products and the great
features you put in your apps,

7
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,726 A:middle
and that means we get to
focus on users and think

8
00:00:40,726 --> 00:00:43,686 A:middle
about how users with these
different abilities use

9
00:00:43,686 --> 00:00:44,296 A:middle
our features.

10
00:00:44,846 --> 00:00:47,636 A:middle
That, in turn, has allowed
Apple to create great futures

11
00:00:47,946 --> 00:00:51,336 A:middle
to empower users, like
the girl you see here

12
00:00:51,336 --> 00:00:55,106 A:middle
with a switch mounted next
to her head which allows her

13
00:00:55,106 --> 00:00:57,646 A:middle
to control all of iOS,
with just that one button.

14
00:00:57,646 --> 00:01:01,016 A:middle
And that gives her the
freedom to communicate and play

15

16
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

17
00:00:57,646 --> 00:01:01,016 A:middle
And that gives her the
freedom to communicate and play

18
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,756 A:middle
without the need for assistance.

19
00:01:04,226 --> 00:01:07,366 A:middle
And as users get older
and older, more and more

20
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:09,696 A:middle
of them will be using these
accessibility features,

21
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:12,116 A:middle
so the time is really
now to start thinking

22
00:01:12,116 --> 00:01:15,306 A:middle
about accessibility in
the terms of your app.

23
00:01:16,336 --> 00:01:19,806 A:middle
So Apple creates these great
accessibility features,

24
00:01:19,806 --> 00:01:21,376 A:middle
but that's only part
of the story.

25
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:24,016 A:middle
We need all of your
apps to be accessible

26
00:01:24,396 --> 00:01:27,146 A:middle
so we can create a great
ecosystem for accessibility

27
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:28,426 A:middle
and empower these users.

28
00:01:29,886 --> 00:01:32,276 A:middle
Today we will be talking about
the accessibility futures

29
00:01:32,566 --> 00:01:33,906 A:middle
that Apple provides on iOS.

30
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:39,416 A:middle
We will look at what's new
in iOS ,9 and we will go

31
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:41,166 A:middle
through what we call
an accessibility audit,

32
00:01:41,246 --> 00:01:42,536 A:middle
where we will look at an app

33
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,376 A:middle
and see how accessible
it is already.

34
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:48,236 A:middle
Then we will go through
implementing some accessibility

35
00:01:48,646 --> 00:01:49,226 A:middle
in that app.

36
00:01:50,596 --> 00:01:52,476 A:middle
But first, let's take a look

37
00:01:52,476 --> 00:01:55,376 A:middle
at the accessibility
features that Apple provides.

38
00:01:56,136 --> 00:02:00,516 A:middle
We break those into four large
areas: hearing, learning,

39

40
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

41
00:01:56,136 --> 00:02:00,516 A:middle
We break those into four large
areas: hearing, learning,

42
00:02:01,386 --> 00:02:03,626 A:middle
vision, and physical and motor.

43
00:02:04,126 --> 00:02:06,676 A:middle
So I will go through just a few
of the features that we have,

44
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:10,985 A:middle
but there are many more I don't
have time to talk about today.

45
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:13,926 A:middle
For hearing, we have
made-for-iPhone hearing aids,

46
00:02:14,306 --> 00:02:17,296 A:middle
which allow users to stream
high-quality audio directly

47
00:02:17,296 --> 00:02:19,756 A:middle
from their iOS device
and control the settings

48
00:02:19,756 --> 00:02:20,596 A:middle
of those hearing aids.

49
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:24,516 A:middle
This replaces a lot of extra
hardware the user would have

50
00:02:24,516 --> 00:02:25,716 A:middle
to carry with them
all of the time

51
00:02:26,086 --> 00:02:30,486 A:middle
and provides a much more private
experience for setting these

52
00:02:30,926 --> 00:02:32,246 A:middle
or changing the settings
for hearing aids.

53
00:02:33,756 --> 00:02:37,336 A:middle
For learning, we have guided
access, which lets teachers,

54
00:02:37,376 --> 00:02:41,506 A:middle
parents, and caregivers remove
distractions so users can focus

55
00:02:41,506 --> 00:02:42,966 A:middle
on a specific app or task.

56
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,476 A:middle
And we even provide time limits

57
00:02:46,676 --> 00:02:49,656 A:middle
so you can restrict the
time allowed in a task.

58
00:02:50,076 --> 00:02:54,056 A:middle
For developers, we provide
an API that allows you

59
00:02:54,056 --> 00:02:57,506 A:middle
to provide specific
restrictions for your app.

60
00:02:58,876 --> 00:03:03,316 A:middle
For vision, we have
VoiceOver, which lets blind

61

62
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

63
00:02:58,876 --> 00:03:03,316 A:middle
For vision, we have
VoiceOver, which lets blind

64
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,306 A:middle
and low-vision users
touch the screen

65
00:03:05,306 --> 00:03:07,346 A:middle
and have VoiceOver read
what's under their finger.

66
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:11,036 A:middle
So they can use gestures
to interact

67
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:14,356 A:middle
with the touchscreen even though
they can't see the screen.

68
00:03:16,116 --> 00:03:19,966 A:middle
We also have Zoom, which lets
users who may need things

69
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,186 A:middle
to be just a little bit bigger

70
00:03:21,186 --> 00:03:25,206 A:middle
but can see the screen magnify
the interface of your app

71
00:03:25,426 --> 00:03:27,476 A:middle
and the operating system.

72
00:03:27,936 --> 00:03:31,066 A:middle
And it will even
follow text as you type

73
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:32,686 A:middle
and leave the keyboard unzoomed

74
00:03:33,216 --> 00:03:35,476 A:middle
so you can still have full
access to the keyboard.

75
00:03:35,906 --> 00:03:38,106 A:middle
Finally for vision, we
have Vision Accommodations,

76
00:03:38,496 --> 00:03:40,086 A:middle
which adjusts the
interface for users

77
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,966 A:middle
who might need larger
text, higher contrast,

78
00:03:43,386 --> 00:03:46,586 A:middle
or reduced motion so users can
more easily orient themselves

79
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:47,486 A:middle
with what's on screen.

80
00:03:49,236 --> 00:03:51,686 A:middle
For physical and motor,
we have Switch Control,

81
00:03:51,686 --> 00:03:54,356 A:middle
which uses these
switches, or large buttons,

82
00:03:54,806 --> 00:03:56,346 A:middle
to control the operating system.

83
00:03:56,476 --> 00:03:59,296 A:middle
It's great for users who may
not be able to fully interact

84
00:03:59,296 --> 00:04:01,626 A:middle
with the touchscreen,
and it allows them

85

86
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

87
00:03:59,296 --> 00:04:01,626 A:middle
with the touchscreen,
and it allows them

88
00:04:01,626 --> 00:04:04,076 A:middle
to sequentially navigate
the items on screen

89
00:04:04,426 --> 00:04:07,386 A:middle
and perform complex
gestures and even play games.

90
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:14,296 A:middle
If a user has difficulty
performing gestures

91
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,326 A:middle
or pressing a physical
button, we have AssistiveTouch,

92
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:19,375 A:middle
which provides a menu to
quickly access recorded gestures

93
00:04:19,935 --> 00:04:21,065 A:middle
and hardware buttons.

94
00:04:21,065 --> 00:04:21,726 A:middle
And this even works

95
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:24,376 A:middle
with third-party assistive
devices like wheelchairs.

96
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:29,256 A:middle
And brand new in iOS 9 we
have Touch Accommodations,

97
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:32,196 A:middle
which helps users who may have
difficulty performing precise

98
00:04:32,196 --> 00:04:35,766 A:middle
gestures by changing the way the
touchscreen responds to touches,

99
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:38,766 A:middle
and I would love to give
you a demo of that now.

100
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:42,386 A:middle
Like all accessibility
features, you can turn

101
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:45,086 A:middle
on Touch Accommodations by
going to Settings, General,

102
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:48,506 A:middle
Accessibility, and you
can see the large list

103
00:04:48,506 --> 00:04:50,106 A:middle
of accessibility
features we provide.

104
00:04:50,636 --> 00:04:53,296 A:middle
But for now, we will go
into Touch Accommodations.

105
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:55,416 A:middle
And you see we have
got three options.

106
00:04:56,006 --> 00:04:57,366 A:middle
Let's look at Hold Duration.

107
00:04:58,196 --> 00:05:02,936 A:middle
And this allows people
who may have tremors

108

109
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

110
00:04:58,196 --> 00:05:02,936 A:middle
And this allows people
who may have tremors

111
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:06,526 A:middle
and touch the screen more than
they would like to set a timeout

112
00:05:06,846 --> 00:05:11,126 A:middle
so not all touches are used.

113
00:05:11,126 --> 00:05:14,536 A:middle
So let's turn on Hold Duration
and Touch Accommodations.

114
00:05:14,786 --> 00:05:17,106 A:middle
So I go back to the Home
button, you will notice

115
00:05:17,106 --> 00:05:20,486 A:middle
when I put my finger on the
screen I get this timer icon,

116
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:23,116 A:middle
and if I lift up
before the time is up,

117
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:25,266 A:middle
the touch isn't passed
to the icon.

118
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:28,456 A:middle
But if I tap and hold
for the whole duration,

119
00:05:29,866 --> 00:05:33,076 A:middle
it will open the app.

120
00:05:33,196 --> 00:05:37,536 A:middle
So if I have tremors, they
won't be respected as touches.

121
00:05:38,376 --> 00:05:41,586 A:middle
Great! So if we go
back into Settings,

122
00:05:42,356 --> 00:05:48,406 A:middle
we can look at Tap Assistance,
which is great for users

123
00:05:48,406 --> 00:05:52,446 A:middle
who may not be able to land
on exactly the right icon

124
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:53,456 A:middle
that they are looking for.

125
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,256 A:middle
So if we go back
to the Home screen,

126
00:05:57,236 --> 00:06:02,306 A:middle
you can see that if I press on
Clock and then move to Calendar,

127

128
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

129
00:05:57,236 --> 00:06:02,306 A:middle
you can see that if I press on
Clock and then move to Calendar,

130
00:06:02,926 --> 00:06:05,956 A:middle
the touch will be passed to
Calendar instead of Clock.

131
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:09,966 A:middle
So it's the final touch
location that's respected.

132
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:18,256 A:middle
And that's Touch
Accommodations on iOS 9.

133
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:22,256 A:middle
So, many of these accessibility
features rely on UIAccessibility

134
00:06:22,486 --> 00:06:25,196 A:middle
to bridge the gap between
the assistive technology

135
00:06:25,346 --> 00:06:26,246 A:middle
and your app.

136
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:30,646 A:middle
For instance, if a VoiceOver
user taps on the screen,

137
00:06:31,076 --> 00:06:33,256 A:middle
it will look for the
element under their finger

138
00:06:33,836 --> 00:06:36,706 A:middle
and ask the element in your app
for its accessibility label.

139
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:40,736 A:middle
So when you return the string
Weather, VoiceOver will speak:

140
00:06:40,936 --> 00:06:41,836 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: Weather.

141
00:06:42,696 --> 00:06:46,036 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: And similarly
with Switch Control,

142
00:06:46,036 --> 00:06:49,536 A:middle
the Switch Control user
brings up the menu on one

143
00:06:49,536 --> 00:06:51,406 A:middle
of your elements,
will ask that element

144
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:53,626 A:middle
for its accessibility
custom actions,

145
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:56,836 A:middle
and when you return the
actions -- move, pass and trade,

146
00:06:56,996 --> 00:06:57,916 A:middle
if it's a game app, maybe --

147
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,246 A:middle
it will display those in
the Switch Control menu

148

149
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

150
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,246 A:middle
it will display those in
the Switch Control menu

151
00:07:00,656 --> 00:07:03,766 A:middle
so users have fast
access to these actions

152
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,256 A:middle
on elements in your app.

153
00:07:06,096 --> 00:07:09,586 A:middle
So you will notice that
UIAccessibility is really

154
00:07:09,586 --> 00:07:11,916 A:middle
about asking questions
of elements in your app

155
00:07:12,316 --> 00:07:15,226 A:middle
so the assistive technology
knows how to work with it.

156
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,616 A:middle
So let's go through a
few of those questions.

157
00:07:18,286 --> 00:07:19,936 A:middle
The first one is: Do
I serve a purpose?

158
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:24,336 A:middle
This is really about
whether an element is useful

159
00:07:24,336 --> 00:07:25,656 A:middle
or important to the user.

160
00:07:25,936 --> 00:07:28,196 A:middle
So a line that separates
elements

161
00:07:28,196 --> 00:07:29,806 A:middle
in a view is very
important visually,

162
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:31,846 A:middle
but since the user
can't interact with it

163
00:07:31,846 --> 00:07:34,736 A:middle
and it doesn't provide
information like a UI label,

164
00:07:35,176 --> 00:07:36,726 A:middle
it's not really serving
a purpose.

165
00:07:37,926 --> 00:07:40,916 A:middle
So we answer this question
with Is Accessibility Element.

166
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:45,496 A:middle
If we look at the Plus button
in Clock, it's a button,

167
00:07:45,496 --> 00:07:46,946 A:middle
the user can interact with it,

168
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:48,986 A:middle
and so for that we
would return True.

169
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:53,526 A:middle
The next most important
question is: What's my name?

170
00:07:53,986 --> 00:07:56,146 A:middle
We answer that with
Accessibility Label.

171
00:07:56,246 --> 00:07:58,976 A:middle
This is what VoiceOver
uses to read

172
00:07:58,976 --> 00:08:00,606 A:middle
to the user what's
under their finger.

173

174
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

175
00:07:58,976 --> 00:08:00,606 A:middle
to the user what's
under their finger.

176
00:08:01,386 --> 00:08:05,586 A:middle
If we look at the Plus
button, you might be tempted

177
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:08,386 A:middle
to set the label to something
like Button To Add A Clock,

178
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:12,216 A:middle
which is a great description
of what the button will do,

179
00:08:12,216 --> 00:08:14,726 A:middle
but you should think of the
accessibility label more

180
00:08:14,726 --> 00:08:16,626 A:middle
like the title of a button,

181
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:20,366 A:middle
so a better accessibility
label would just be Add.

182
00:08:21,276 --> 00:08:25,986 A:middle
So what's the personality
of the element in your app?

183
00:08:25,986 --> 00:08:29,566 A:middle
And this is really about
describing to the user

184
00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:32,696 A:middle
and the assistive technology
how they can interact

185
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:33,275 A:middle
with an element.

186
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:35,696 A:middle
So we answer that with
Accessibility Traits.

187
00:08:35,946 --> 00:08:38,905 A:middle
So we have a whole host
of traits that you can set

188
00:08:38,905 --> 00:08:42,056 A:middle
on elements that describe
how to interact with them.

189
00:08:42,546 --> 00:08:46,076 A:middle
So if we look at the Plus
or Add button in Clock,

190
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:49,476 A:middle
we would set the trait to
Button, because it's a button,

191
00:08:49,476 --> 00:08:52,026 A:middle
and VoiceOver would read
it as a button to the user.

192
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:56,306 A:middle
Next question is:
What's my value?

193
00:08:56,716 --> 00:08:59,666 A:middle
So if an element has a state
that changes frequently

194
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,506 A:middle
over its life, we would
change that or update

195

196
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

197
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,506 A:middle
over its life, we would
change that or update

198
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:04,636 A:middle
that with Accessibility Value.

199
00:09:05,486 --> 00:09:07,926 A:middle
So if this time we look
at the Clock element,

200
00:09:08,426 --> 00:09:10,186 A:middle
the value that changes
would be the time,

201
00:09:10,746 --> 00:09:15,156 A:middle
and so we would return the
string 11:20 a.m. and update

202
00:09:15,156 --> 00:09:16,626 A:middle
that accordingly as
the time changes.

203
00:09:17,286 --> 00:09:21,936 A:middle
So the next question is: How
should people interact with me?

204
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:26,496 A:middle
If the traits aren't enough
to describe how to interact

205
00:09:26,496 --> 00:09:28,306 A:middle
with an element, where you
need just a little bit more

206
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:31,466 A:middle
information, you can provide
that with Accessibility Hint.

207
00:09:32,636 --> 00:09:35,306 A:middle
So if we look at the
grabber in World Clock,

208
00:09:35,846 --> 00:09:37,946 A:middle
we could set the hint to
something like, drag up

209
00:09:37,946 --> 00:09:39,136 A:middle
or down to change the order.

210
00:09:39,766 --> 00:09:41,406 A:middle
And this is, this describes

211
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:43,326 A:middle
to the user exactly how
they can interact with it,

212
00:09:43,606 --> 00:09:47,706 A:middle
just a short description
of how to use it.

213
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:49,396 A:middle
And finally: Where am I?

214
00:09:49,896 --> 00:09:51,556 A:middle
You may have noticed
that Switch Control

215
00:09:51,786 --> 00:09:54,866 A:middle
and VoiceOver have cursors
that move around the screen.

216
00:09:55,516 --> 00:09:57,476 A:middle
So we need to know where
to display that cursor.

217
00:09:58,036 --> 00:10:00,026 A:middle
So we answer that with
Accessibility Frame.

218

219
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

220
00:09:58,036 --> 00:10:00,026 A:middle
So we answer that with
Accessibility Frame.

221
00:10:01,116 --> 00:10:03,766 A:middle
And that's how we draw the
beautiful cursor we see here.

222
00:10:04,756 --> 00:10:07,356 A:middle
It's important to
remember that the frame is

223
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,696 A:middle
in screen coordinates, so
we provide a helper method

224
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:11,536 A:middle
to convert from view
to screen coordinates.

225
00:10:12,556 --> 00:10:16,106 A:middle
Most of the time we assume this
to just be the frame of a view,

226
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,846 A:middle
so you won't need to touch
this unless you need it

227
00:10:18,846 --> 00:10:20,776 A:middle
to be something a
little bit more specific.

228
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:24,526 A:middle
And that's it!

229
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:28,756 A:middle
Those six methods make up the
basic API for UI accessibility,

230
00:10:29,126 --> 00:10:31,646 A:middle
and that's enough to get
most of accessibility done,

231
00:10:32,126 --> 00:10:34,926 A:middle
so just a few lines of
code and a few minutes

232
00:10:35,126 --> 00:10:36,706 A:middle
to make your app
really accessible.

233
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:41,536 A:middle
But the really great news
is we do most of the work.

234
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,716 A:middle
So if you use standard
controls in UIKit,

235
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:46,476 A:middle
most of this is done for you.

236
00:10:47,056 --> 00:10:48,656 A:middle
If you do custom drawing,

237
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:50,976 A:middle
we need you to answer
these questions for us

238
00:10:51,206 --> 00:10:54,456 A:middle
so accessibility users can know
how to interact with your app.

239
00:10:54,456 --> 00:10:57,136 A:middle
So just that really
small investment

240
00:10:57,446 --> 00:11:00,266 A:middle
of those six methods will
give you a large reward

241

242
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

243
00:10:57,446 --> 00:11:00,266 A:middle
of those six methods will
give you a large reward

244
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:02,286 A:middle
of a lot more people being
able to use your app.

245
00:11:03,086 --> 00:11:06,776 A:middle
So it's not that much to
make something accessible.

246
00:11:07,386 --> 00:11:11,586 A:middle
So now your convinced:
accessibility, just six methods,

247
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:13,886 A:middle
that's easy, how do I do it?

248
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:16,706 A:middle
The first step is
design for accessibility.

249
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:19,956 A:middle
So when you are thinking
about your app and thinking

250
00:11:19,956 --> 00:11:22,796 A:middle
about how users will use
the app you are building,

251
00:11:22,906 --> 00:11:24,866 A:middle
think about Switch
Control and VoiceOver users

252
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:27,346 A:middle
and how they will
interact with your app.

253
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:32,076 A:middle
But if you have an app already,
like we assume most of you do,

254
00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:34,836 A:middle
the best way to start is
do an audit of your app

255
00:11:34,836 --> 00:11:37,886 A:middle
and see how accessible it is
already, because, like I said,

256
00:11:37,986 --> 00:11:40,226 A:middle
if you use UIKit
standard controls,

257
00:11:40,296 --> 00:11:41,666 A:middle
most of this should
be done already.

258
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:45,476 A:middle
There are a few ways to
do an accessibility audit.

259
00:11:46,046 --> 00:11:48,216 A:middle
The first one is the
accessibility inspector

260
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:49,816 A:middle
in the simulator.

261
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:52,586 A:middle
And you turn that on by
going to Settings, General,

262
00:11:52,986 --> 00:11:56,036 A:middle
Accessibility, and
turning on the inspector,

263
00:11:56,776 --> 00:11:58,636 A:middle
and you will notice that it
brings up this beautiful window

264
00:11:58,956 --> 00:12:01,206 A:middle
that answers those six questions
we have been talking about.

265

266
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

267
00:11:58,956 --> 00:12:01,206 A:middle
that answers those six questions
we have been talking about.

268
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:04,066 A:middle
So you can quickly spot check
the elements in your app

269
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:06,796 A:middle
and make sure they are
responding as you expect.

270
00:12:07,296 --> 00:12:11,676 A:middle
The best way to check
for accessibility is

271
00:12:11,786 --> 00:12:14,306 A:middle
to use the accessibility
features on the device,

272
00:12:14,636 --> 00:12:16,396 A:middle
like VoiceOver and
Switch Control.

273
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:19,746 A:middle
And I would love to
do that with you now.

274
00:12:20,726 --> 00:12:24,296 A:middle
So back in Settings, we can turn
on VoiceOver by going to the top

275
00:12:24,296 --> 00:12:28,366 A:middle
of Accessibility Settings, but
I would recommend if you are new

276
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:33,136 A:middle
to VoiceOver to come down to the
Accessibility shortcut and turn

277
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:36,276 A:middle
on VoiceOver, so that way you
can tap the Home button three

278
00:12:36,276 --> 00:12:38,236 A:middle
times anywhere in
the operating system

279
00:12:38,296 --> 00:12:39,666 A:middle
to turn VoiceOver on and off.

280
00:12:40,246 --> 00:12:42,406 A:middle
So if we go back
to the Home screen,

281
00:12:42,406 --> 00:12:46,546 A:middle
I will tap the Home
button three times.

282
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:51,536 A:middle
There is VoiceOver telling
us it's on Messages,

283
00:12:51,536 --> 00:12:53,856 A:middle
so I will take one finger
and move it around the screen

284
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,546 A:middle
and VoiceOver will read
what's under my finger.

285
00:12:56,506 --> 00:12:59,606 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: weather, clock,
map, videos, wallet, stocks,

286
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,266 A:middle
reminders, two tasks due today.

287

288
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

289
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,266 A:middle
reminders, two tasks due today.

290
00:13:02,296 --> 00:13:03,026 A:middle
Double-tap to open.

291
00:13:03,026 --> 00:13:05,826 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: I have a few
more things to do today.

292
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:06,276 A:middle
All right.

293
00:13:06,616 --> 00:13:08,576 A:middle
So if I take one
finger and swipe right,

294
00:13:08,576 --> 00:13:09,686 A:middle
it will move to the
next element.

295
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:12,066 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: Stocks,
double-tap to open.

296
00:13:12,786 --> 00:13:15,306 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: Tell me about
stocks, and if I take one finger

297
00:13:15,306 --> 00:13:21,696 A:middle
and slide to the left, it will
move to the previous element.

298
00:13:22,356 --> 00:13:25,706 A:middle
So double-tap with one finger
will activate an element,

299
00:13:26,126 --> 00:13:27,316 A:middle
so it will bring up Reminders.

300
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:31,226 A:middle
And then the only other gesture

301
00:13:32,196 --> 00:13:37,126 A:middle
that you will need is a
three-finger gesture to scroll,

302
00:13:37,126 --> 00:13:41,526 A:middle
so I will take three fingers
and scroll to the next,

303
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:43,966 A:middle
and previous, element,
and that's it.

304
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:47,526 A:middle
Just the few gestures will
control VoiceOver and allow you

305
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:48,856 A:middle
to check your app
for accessibility.

306
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:53,886 A:middle
Let's take a look at Clock and
check it for accessibility.

307
00:13:53,886 --> 00:13:56,946 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: Clock, 9:15
a.m. Double tap to open.

308
00:13:57,196 --> 00:13:58,166 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: Double
tap to open.

309
00:13:58,426 --> 00:13:59,716 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: Clock,
edit, button.

310

311
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

312
00:14:00,636 --> 00:14:02,586 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: When you are doing
an audit, you want to check

313
00:14:02,846 --> 00:14:05,516 A:middle
that everything has an
accessibility label,

314
00:14:05,516 --> 00:14:06,866 A:middle
it has a meaningful value.

315
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:10,936 A:middle
If its state changes, you want
to swipe through the elements

316
00:14:11,286 --> 00:14:12,756 A:middle
and make sure that
the order makes sense

317
00:14:13,276 --> 00:14:15,146 A:middle
so that it's moving
from, generally,

318
00:14:15,316 --> 00:14:17,986 A:middle
top left to bottom right if you
are in a left-to-right language

319
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:19,666 A:middle
and the reverse if you
are in a right-to-left.

320
00:14:20,346 --> 00:14:21,956 A:middle
So let's swipe through
and listen

321
00:14:21,956 --> 00:14:24,116 A:middle
to what VoiceOver
finds in this app.

322
00:14:24,836 --> 00:14:29,246 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: World clock,
heading, Cupertino, today,

323
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:32,876 A:middle
9:16 a.m. Swipe up or down
to select a custom action,

324
00:14:33,076 --> 00:14:34,096 A:middle
then double-tap to activate.

325
00:14:34,566 --> 00:14:37,076 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: So VoiceOver
is telling us the label

326
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,306 A:middle
and the value.

327
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:41,866 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: Selected,
world clock, tap.

328
00:14:42,406 --> 00:14:43,866 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: This has
the Selected trait.

329
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:45,036 A:middle
So that's another
trait you can add.

330
00:14:45,036 --> 00:14:48,866 A:middle
It tells us that there is three
more elements in the tab bar.

331
00:14:48,866 --> 00:14:50,776 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: Alarm, tab.

332
00:14:51,206 --> 00:14:52,396 A:middle
Stopwatch, tab.

333
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:53,706 A:middle
Timer, tab.

334
00:14:54,016 --> 00:14:54,446 A:middle
Four of four.

335
00:14:55,256 --> 00:14:58,526 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: So I can swipe
to everything in World Clock,

336
00:14:58,526 --> 00:14:59,506 A:middle
or at least on this screen,

337
00:14:59,506 --> 00:15:02,226 A:middle
everything has a label,
a meaningful value.

338

339
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

340
00:14:59,506 --> 00:15:02,226 A:middle
everything has a label,
a meaningful value.

341
00:15:02,226 --> 00:15:03,486 A:middle
The traits are set properly.

342
00:15:03,906 --> 00:15:06,416 A:middle
So this looks pretty
accessible, that's good.

343
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,146 A:middle
So I will turn off
VoiceOver now.

344
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:09,226 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: Voiceover off.

345
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:11,046 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: Let's
look at an app

346
00:15:11,046 --> 00:15:13,046 A:middle
that I brought called
QuakeWatch.

347
00:15:14,116 --> 00:15:17,366 A:middle
I'm from the Bay Area,
which means I'm obsessed

348
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:21,166 A:middle
with earthquakes, so I wrote an
app that will track earthquakes

349
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,046 A:middle
as they happen in real
time around the world.

350
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:25,666 A:middle
Great for a native like me.

351
00:15:25,806 --> 00:15:27,786 A:middle
So you can see that
earthquakes are happening

352
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:29,656 A:middle
or have happened recently.

353
00:15:30,086 --> 00:15:33,846 A:middle
And it will tell you where it
happened, when it happened,

354
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:38,236 A:middle
and the text color tells you
the magnitude of the earthquake,

355
00:15:38,236 --> 00:15:39,386 A:middle
and we even get a
little map view.

356
00:15:39,556 --> 00:15:43,606 A:middle
So if I tap in, I can look

357
00:15:43,606 --> 00:15:46,216 A:middle
at the earthquake on
a map, I zoom out.

358
00:15:46,216 --> 00:15:50,556 A:middle
I should be able to find other
earthquakes, and I can tap

359
00:15:50,556 --> 00:15:52,986 A:middle
to get more information
about the earthquake.

360
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,556 A:middle
There is even an Info button
that will take me to USGS

361
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:57,916 A:middle
and give me even
more information.

362
00:15:57,986 --> 00:16:04,746 A:middle
I can tap and hold on a set
of earthquakes to add them

363

364
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

365
00:15:57,986 --> 00:16:04,746 A:middle
I can tap and hold on a set
of earthquakes to add them

366
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:07,116 A:middle
to my favorite list
and even compare them.

367
00:16:08,126 --> 00:16:08,826 A:middle
Pretty cool app!

368
00:16:09,756 --> 00:16:11,246 A:middle
Best earthquake app
I have ever seen.

369
00:16:12,676 --> 00:16:14,266 A:middle
So if I triple-tap
with VoiceOver,

370
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:19,666 A:middle
let's see what the VoiceOver
user would see with this app.

371
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:20,556 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: VoiceOver on,

372
00:16:20,836 --> 00:16:22,646 A:middle
QuakeWatch, earthquakes,
heading.

373
00:16:23,536 --> 00:16:25,256 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: Earthquakes,
heading, so far so good.

374
00:16:25,336 --> 00:16:26,366 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: Favorites, button.

375
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:29,116 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: Favorites,
button, that's pretty good.

376
00:16:29,826 --> 00:16:31,806 A:middle
So these are standard
UIKit controls,

377
00:16:31,806 --> 00:16:32,636 A:middle
so I get them for free.

378
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:33,466 A:middle
That's great.

379
00:16:33,836 --> 00:16:37,646 A:middle
Now, I will take my one
finger and slide around

380
00:16:37,856 --> 00:16:40,446 A:middle
and see what we find
with the cells.

381
00:16:41,516 --> 00:16:44,576 A:middle
[Tapping noise]

382
00:16:45,076 --> 00:16:49,146 A:middle
So that sound you are hearing
is VoiceOver telling you

383
00:16:49,146 --> 00:16:52,976 A:middle
that it can't find anything
to touch under that finger,

384
00:16:53,436 --> 00:16:55,216 A:middle
so the cells aren't accessible.

385
00:16:55,506 --> 00:16:56,116 A:middle
That's no good.

386
00:16:56,916 --> 00:17:00,396 A:middle
Let's go into the
favorites, look at that graph.

387

388
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

389
00:16:56,916 --> 00:17:00,396 A:middle
Let's go into the
favorites, look at that graph.

390
00:17:01,516 --> 00:17:04,556 A:middle
[Tapping noise]

391
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:06,626 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: It looks like the
graph isn't accessible either.

392
00:17:06,906 --> 00:17:11,026 A:middle
That's unfortunate,
such a beautiful graph.

393
00:17:11,455 --> 00:17:15,425 A:middle
So there is one more
gesture that might help you

394
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:18,906 A:middle
as you are looking at your app,
if you do a double tap and hold,

395
00:17:19,316 --> 00:17:22,366 A:middle
VoiceOver will pass through
the touch and just push it

396
00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:24,396 A:middle
through to whatever
is under your finger.

397
00:17:24,906 --> 00:17:27,056 A:middle
So even though the
cell isn't accessible,

398
00:17:27,435 --> 00:17:29,046 A:middle
we can jump in and --

399
00:17:29,046 --> 00:17:31,586 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: Earthquake,
shows more info, detail.

400
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:32,166 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: Get to the view.

401
00:17:32,516 --> 00:17:34,306 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: Detail,
earthquakes, back button.

402
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:35,656 A:middle
Earthquake.

403
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:37,686 A:middle
Show more info.

404
00:17:37,686 --> 00:17:43,556 A:middle
Use the rotor to access
points of interest.

405
00:17:43,556 --> 00:17:43,706 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: All right.

406
00:17:43,706 --> 00:17:43,876 A:middle
Nice.

407
00:17:44,486 --> 00:17:47,096 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: Earthquake,
location, 74 kilometers,

408
00:17:47,186 --> 00:17:51,446 A:middle
felt by zero people,
magnitude 1.50.

409
00:17:52,716 --> 00:17:53,556 A:middle
Dismiss pop up.

410
00:17:54,546 --> 00:17:55,156 A:middle
Double-tap to --

411
00:17:55,556 --> 00:17:58,136 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: It looks like the
Info button isn't accessible,

412
00:17:58,136 --> 00:17:59,516 A:middle
so VoiceOver just
doesn't see it.

413
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:04,556 A:middle
So it's not very accessible
to a VoiceOver user.

414

415
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

416
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:04,556 A:middle
So it's not very accessible
to a VoiceOver user.

417
00:18:04,556 --> 00:18:06,406 A:middle
They can't really get to
any of the information,

418
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:09,146 A:middle
so it's mostly useless.

419
00:18:10,186 --> 00:18:11,436 A:middle
Let's turn off VoiceOver.

420
00:18:12,836 --> 00:18:14,326 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: VoiceOver off.

421
00:18:14,996 --> 00:18:18,656 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: So
what did we find

422
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:20,316 A:middle
with our accessibility audit?

423
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:26,826 A:middle
We have got that earthquake
cell that just isn't accessible,

424
00:18:26,956 --> 00:18:28,496 A:middle
VoiceOver couldn't
see it at all,

425
00:18:28,926 --> 00:18:33,406 A:middle
and the text color is
communicating magnitude,

426
00:18:33,406 --> 00:18:36,216 A:middle
which isn't a great way
to communicate magnitude

427
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:38,756 A:middle
because not everyone
can see all colors

428
00:18:38,756 --> 00:18:41,486 A:middle
and it's also just really
ugly and difficult to read,

429
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:43,246 A:middle
as you can see with
the yellow here.

430
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:48,176 A:middle
There is that map detail
view, where the labels need

431
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:50,316 A:middle
to be a little more
specific about their purpose.

432
00:18:51,186 --> 00:18:54,016 A:middle
And that Info button
is completely invisible

433
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:54,826 A:middle
to VoiceOver users.

434
00:18:56,406 --> 00:18:57,616 A:middle
So that's no good.

435
00:18:58,256 --> 00:19:00,836 A:middle
But the great news is those six
methods we have been talking

436

437
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

438
00:18:58,256 --> 00:19:00,836 A:middle
But the great news is those six
methods we have been talking

439
00:19:00,836 --> 00:19:03,526 A:middle
about so far are enough
to fix all of these issues

440
00:19:03,526 --> 00:19:05,216 A:middle
with just a few lines of
code in a few minutes.

441
00:19:05,816 --> 00:19:09,206 A:middle
So let's do that together now.

442
00:19:09,596 --> 00:19:10,386 A:middle
All right.

443
00:19:11,056 --> 00:19:15,746 A:middle
So here is QuakeWatch and
the first thing we will look

444
00:19:15,746 --> 00:19:17,736 A:middle
at is that earthquake cell.

445
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:23,536 A:middle
The earthquake cell is
written in Swift and the rest

446
00:19:23,536 --> 00:19:25,586 A:middle
of the p roject is
in Objective-C,

447
00:19:25,886 --> 00:19:29,176 A:middle
so accessibility works
in both languages

448
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,186 A:middle
and it can coexist just
like the rest of your code.

449
00:19:33,266 --> 00:19:34,226 A:middle
So let's see.

450
00:19:34,226 --> 00:19:35,886 A:middle
It's not accessible.

451
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,876 A:middle
If we look down, we can see

452
00:19:38,876 --> 00:19:42,346 A:middle
that the reason it's not
accessible is I'm taking a

453
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:44,136 A:middle
string and drawing
it at a point.

454
00:19:44,406 --> 00:19:48,566 A:middle
So if I used UI labels instead,
this would be accessible for me,

455
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:51,146 A:middle
but because I'm drawing
the strings directly

456
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:52,836 A:middle
into the view, it's
not accessible.

457
00:19:53,606 --> 00:19:58,546 A:middle
And then I'm grabbing
the alert color and using

458
00:19:58,546 --> 00:20:01,656 A:middle
that as the text color
for all of these strings.

459

460
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

461
00:19:58,546 --> 00:20:01,656 A:middle
that as the text color
for all of these strings.

462
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:05,416 A:middle
So the first thing we
should do is get rid of that

463
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,696 A:middle
and instead use UI
color black color.

464
00:20:09,596 --> 00:20:10,636 A:middle
Now, we will all
be able to read it.

465
00:20:10,716 --> 00:20:11,316 A:middle
Won't that be great?

466
00:20:12,626 --> 00:20:17,256 A:middle
And now that we aren't using
that for the magnitude,

467
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:21,596 A:middle
let's just keep up with that
trend and add a magnitude string

468
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:24,716 A:middle
that we draw directly
to the view.

469
00:20:24,906 --> 00:20:25,386 A:middle
Why not? All right.

470
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,316 A:middle
So that will take care
of the text color.

471
00:20:29,346 --> 00:20:30,676 A:middle
How do we make it accessible?

472
00:20:31,116 --> 00:20:34,266 A:middle
If we come up here to where we
set the earthquake on the cell,

473
00:20:35,256 --> 00:20:41,386 A:middle
we can grab the date that
the earthquake happened,

474
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,976 A:middle
and a handy event
description that will tell us

475
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:47,946 A:middle
where it happened, and format
it correctly, obviously.

476
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:51,446 A:middle
We will set Is Accessibility
Element to True on the cell

477
00:20:51,706 --> 00:20:53,136 A:middle
so VoiceOver will
be able to find it,

478
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:54,476 A:middle
and then we will set the label

479
00:20:54,476 --> 00:20:57,126 A:middle
to the description
we just built.

480
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:58,866 A:middle
Okay. Great!

481
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:00,986 A:middle
The only other thing
we might want

482

483
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

484
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:00,986 A:middle
The only other thing
we might want

485
00:21:00,986 --> 00:21:03,776 A:middle
to add is a value
for that favorite.

486
00:21:04,816 --> 00:21:06,166 A:middle
When you add something
to a favorites list,

487
00:21:06,396 --> 00:21:08,036 A:middle
obviously a VoiceOver user
would want to know that.

488
00:21:08,896 --> 00:21:12,436 A:middle
Down here where we
toggle the favorite,

489
00:21:12,846 --> 00:21:17,326 A:middle
we can add a little bit of code

490
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:19,686 A:middle
that sets the accessibility
value

491
00:21:19,756 --> 00:21:23,086 A:middle
to Favorite if it's a favorite.

492
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,146 A:middle
So let's take a look
at the popover view.

493
00:21:27,556 --> 00:21:30,446 A:middle
I happen to know it's here.

494
00:21:31,626 --> 00:21:35,716 A:middle
So it looks like that button
is actually a UI control,

495
00:21:35,876 --> 00:21:38,256 A:middle
which would explain why
it's not accessible.

496
00:21:38,456 --> 00:21:41,776 A:middle
If I had used a UI button,
this would be accessible

497
00:21:41,776 --> 00:21:44,306 A:middle
from the start, but we
need a little bit of help

498
00:21:44,306 --> 00:21:45,496 A:middle
to make it accessible.

499
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:50,826 A:middle
So let's do that now.

500
00:21:50,826 --> 00:21:54,786 A:middle
So we will take the More Info
button, set Is Accessibility

501
00:21:54,786 --> 00:21:58,716 A:middle
to Yes, add the Button trait,
and then we'll set the label

502
00:21:58,716 --> 00:22:01,316 A:middle
to More Info and the
hint to Double-Tap

505
00:21:58,716 --> 00:22:01,316 A:middle
to More Info and the
hint to Double-Tap

506
00:22:01,346 --> 00:22:02,276 A:middle
To View More Information.

507
00:22:03,366 --> 00:22:04,916 A:middle
And obviously you would
want to localize this,

508
00:22:05,466 --> 00:22:08,496 A:middle
but for now we will
leave it this way.

509
00:22:09,706 --> 00:22:15,846 A:middle
The only other thing we want to
do here is set the Header trait

510
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:19,256 A:middle
on the location and felt
header, so it's clear what's

511
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:22,416 A:middle
in that view and
what information is

512
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:23,106 A:middle
being communicated.

513
00:22:24,086 --> 00:22:28,076 A:middle
That was just a few minutes
of work, and that should clean

514
00:22:28,076 --> 00:22:29,146 A:middle
up quite a few issues.

515
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:33,866 A:middle
Let's build and check it out.

516
00:22:33,866 --> 00:22:34,196 A:middle
All right.

517
00:22:34,196 --> 00:22:36,446 A:middle
Let's triple-tap home to
turn VoiceOver back on.

518
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,226 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: VoiceOver on.

519
00:22:38,456 --> 00:22:41,966 A:middle
FaceTime, QuakeWatch,
double-tap to open,

520
00:22:42,576 --> 00:22:44,456 A:middle
QuakeWatch, earthquakes,
heading.

521
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:47,746 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: The first
thing you notice is

522
00:22:47,746 --> 00:22:49,836 A:middle
that ugly yellow
color is finally gone.

523
00:22:50,216 --> 00:22:50,826 A:middle
Thank goodness!

524
00:22:51,656 --> 00:22:55,036 A:middle
So let's swipe around with one
finger and see what happens.

525
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:57,666 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: Favorites,
button, 12 kilometers,

526
00:22:57,936 --> 00:23:02,436 A:middle
Oklahoma, 2015, 10:57 a.m.

527

528
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

529
00:22:57,936 --> 00:23:02,436 A:middle
Oklahoma, 2015, 10:57 a.m.

530
00:23:02,436 --> 00:23:04,236 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: So earthquake
finds the cell now.

531
00:23:04,546 --> 00:23:10,716 A:middle
That's good if we come
to the detail view.

532
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:14,566 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: Dismiss
earthquake, location, heading.

533
00:23:14,966 --> 00:23:16,996 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: Location
now has the heading trait,

534
00:23:17,086 --> 00:23:18,506 A:middle
so it's clear what's
happening in the view.

535
00:23:18,506 --> 00:23:19,096 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: 12 kilometers.

536
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:21,256 A:middle
Felt by, heading, zero people.

537
00:23:22,456 --> 00:23:25,076 A:middle
Magnitude 3.00.

538
00:23:25,346 --> 00:23:26,486 A:middle
More info, button.

539
00:23:26,486 --> 00:23:27,836 A:middle
Double-tap to view
more information.

540
00:23:28,196 --> 00:23:29,606 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: The More Info
button is now accessible

541
00:23:29,606 --> 00:23:34,036 A:middle
and tells us how to use
it and what it will do.

542
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,566 A:middle
Great! Just a few lines of
code and we were able to clean

543
00:23:36,566 --> 00:23:38,776 A:middle
up the app and make
it pretty accessible.

544
00:23:39,276 --> 00:23:40,386 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: VoiceOver off.

545
00:23:40,736 --> 00:23:43,456 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: So where
did we get so far?

546
00:23:43,806 --> 00:23:45,516 A:middle
The earthquake cell
is now accessible,

547
00:23:45,516 --> 00:23:46,626 A:middle
we are not communicating
anything

548
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:48,976 A:middle
with text color anymore,
which is really great,

549
00:23:48,976 --> 00:23:50,656 A:middle
that ugly yellow
is finally gone.

550
00:23:51,246 --> 00:23:53,576 A:middle
The map detail view now
has meaningful traits

551
00:23:53,576 --> 00:23:55,016 A:middle
on those labels so it's clear

552
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:57,446 A:middle
to the VoiceOver user what's
happening and they can navigate

553
00:23:57,476 --> 00:23:58,446 A:middle
by headings if they like.

554
00:23:59,026 --> 00:24:00,836 A:middle
That Info button it accessible.

555

556
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

557
00:23:59,026 --> 00:24:00,836 A:middle
That Info button it accessible.

558
00:24:01,076 --> 00:24:05,286 A:middle
We still need a way to add
something to the favorite list,

559
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:09,366 A:middle
and the favorite graph
is still inaccessible.

560
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:14,566 A:middle
How would we make
this graph accessible?

561
00:24:15,596 --> 00:24:17,916 A:middle
So let's start by going back

562
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,706 A:middle
to those questions we were
talking about earlier.

563
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,476 A:middle
The first one was:
Do I serve a purpose?

564
00:24:21,536 --> 00:24:24,666 A:middle
So there is a lot of
information being communicated

565
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:29,016 A:middle
in this graph, but not all of
it is really serving a purpose

566
00:24:29,016 --> 00:24:30,186 A:middle
or really important to the user.

567
00:24:30,186 --> 00:24:32,226 A:middle
So what's the most
important bits in this graph?

568
00:24:32,226 --> 00:24:34,366 A:middle
I think that's the points,

569
00:24:34,796 --> 00:24:36,876 A:middle
because they tell us exactly
what we are comparing,

570
00:24:37,046 --> 00:24:39,376 A:middle
so that's probably what
we should make accessible.

571
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:43,316 A:middle
The next question that's worth
talking about is: Where am I?

572
00:24:43,676 --> 00:24:45,866 A:middle
So what do we set for
the accessibility frame

573
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:46,656 A:middle
for these points?

574
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:50,596 A:middle
So you might think
that the orange boxes

575
00:24:50,596 --> 00:24:55,696 A:middle
that you see now are a
good idea, but if you look

576
00:24:55,696 --> 00:24:59,066 A:middle
at the view as a whole,
most of it isn't accessible.

577
00:24:59,946 --> 00:25:03,806 A:middle
So most of it is
just dead space,

578

579
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

580
00:24:59,946 --> 00:25:03,806 A:middle
So most of it is
just dead space,

581
00:25:04,216 --> 00:25:06,846 A:middle
and so as a VoiceOver
user slides their finger

582
00:25:06,846 --> 00:25:09,526 A:middle
around the screen to search for
points, it will be mostly empty.

583
00:25:10,236 --> 00:25:13,456 A:middle
A better frame might
be something like this.

584
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:16,626 A:middle
So a VoiceOver user can
slide his or her finger

585
00:25:16,626 --> 00:25:18,416 A:middle
across the screen,
and they will hit all

586
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:19,496 A:middle
of the points as they do so.

587
00:25:19,496 --> 00:25:22,316 A:middle
And then as long as we set
the accessibility value

588
00:25:22,316 --> 00:25:24,616 A:middle
to the magnitude, we
haven't lost anything.

589
00:25:24,616 --> 00:25:26,446 A:middle
We haven't lost any information.

590
00:25:26,766 --> 00:25:28,556 A:middle
So that seems like a good plan.

591
00:25:29,456 --> 00:25:30,896 A:middle
Unfortunately, I happen to know

592
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:33,976 A:middle
that the graph view
is just one big view,

593
00:25:33,976 --> 00:25:36,296 A:middle
and everything is drawn
directly into the view.

594
00:25:36,696 --> 00:25:42,056 A:middle
So how do we make one view
accessible into multiple parts?

595
00:25:42,896 --> 00:25:45,406 A:middle
And the good news is we have
got an API for that as well,

596
00:25:45,406 --> 00:25:47,176 A:middle
UIAccessibility element.

597
00:25:47,236 --> 00:25:51,286 A:middle
So this is a great way to
create specific objects just

598
00:25:51,286 --> 00:25:54,416 A:middle
for accessibility to break
up a view into subelements

599
00:25:54,816 --> 00:25:57,186 A:middle
and still answer those great
six questions we have been

600
00:25:57,186 --> 00:25:57,826 A:middle
talking about.

601
00:25:58,486 --> 00:26:01,266 A:middle
The only new part is the
accessibility container,

602

603
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

604
00:25:58,486 --> 00:26:01,266 A:middle
The only new part is the
accessibility container,

605
00:26:01,266 --> 00:26:03,136 A:middle
which you would just set
to the containing view.

606
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:07,616 A:middle
Great! So with this API, we
can make the graph accessible.

607
00:26:08,216 --> 00:26:10,506 A:middle
How do we add something
to that favorite list

608
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,686 A:middle
so there is something
to display on the graph?

609
00:26:13,276 --> 00:26:17,036 A:middle
For that I think we should use
Accessibility Perform Magic Tap,

610
00:26:17,626 --> 00:26:18,716 A:middle
which is this really cool API

611
00:26:18,716 --> 00:26:21,626 A:middle
to just do the right thing
in the right context.

612
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:24,436 A:middle
A good example of that is

613
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,096 A:middle
when a VoiceOver user
gets a phone call,

614
00:26:26,306 --> 00:26:29,666 A:middle
they can do the Magic Tap
gesture, which is two fingers,

615
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:32,776 A:middle
double-tap on the screen, and
that will do the magic thing,

616
00:26:32,866 --> 00:26:34,576 A:middle
which is answer the phone call.

617
00:26:35,406 --> 00:26:38,496 A:middle
So that will allow us to add
something to the favorite list,

618
00:26:39,446 --> 00:26:41,376 A:middle
but what do we add to the list?

619
00:26:42,256 --> 00:26:44,046 A:middle
And for that we can
use some brand-new API

620
00:26:44,206 --> 00:26:46,846 A:middle
in iOS 9 called Accessibility
Focus.

621
00:26:46,956 --> 00:26:50,256 A:middle
This will allow you to get
the currently focused element

622
00:26:50,436 --> 00:26:51,956 A:middle
for a given assistive technology

623
00:26:52,256 --> 00:26:53,726 A:middle
like VoiceOver or
Switch Control.

624
00:26:54,436 --> 00:26:56,486 A:middle
If you are interested in
tracking focus as it moves

625
00:26:56,486 --> 00:26:59,196 A:middle
around your app, we
provide a notification

626
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:02,216 A:middle
that will tell you the
currently focused element

627

628
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

629
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:02,216 A:middle
that will tell you the
currently focused element

630
00:27:02,406 --> 00:27:03,706 A:middle
and the previously
focused element

631
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:05,086 A:middle
for a given assistive
technology.

632
00:27:05,796 --> 00:27:08,356 A:middle
We know what to add
to the favorites list,

633
00:27:08,356 --> 00:27:11,186 A:middle
we know how to add it, and
then we can explore the graph.

634
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:14,596 A:middle
So let's look at
implementing that now.

635
00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:20,546 A:middle
All right.

636
00:27:20,626 --> 00:27:22,036 A:middle
Back in Xcode.

637
00:27:23,096 --> 00:27:26,986 A:middle
So let's add something
to the favorite list.

638
00:27:27,986 --> 00:27:29,576 A:middle
So if we go to the app delegate,

639
00:27:30,746 --> 00:27:35,956 A:middle
we can add Accessibility
Perform Magic Tap.

640
00:27:36,266 --> 00:27:39,526 A:middle
So we will grab the currently
focused element for VoiceOver,

641
00:27:40,366 --> 00:27:43,246 A:middle
check if that element
responds to toggle favorite,

642
00:27:43,276 --> 00:27:46,286 A:middle
like the cell, and if it
does, we will ask it to toggle

643
00:27:46,286 --> 00:27:47,696 A:middle
as favorite and then return Yes.

644
00:27:48,206 --> 00:27:49,506 A:middle
Otherwise, we return No,

645
00:27:49,946 --> 00:27:52,416 A:middle
and VoiceOver will do the
next-most-magical thing

646
00:27:52,566 --> 00:27:54,356 A:middle
in that context,
whatever that may be.

647
00:27:54,856 --> 00:27:59,186 A:middle
So that will allow us to add
something to the favorite list.

648
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,456 A:middle
Now, let's look at the graph.

649

650
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

651
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,456 A:middle
Now, let's look at the graph.

652
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:03,716 A:middle
All right.

653
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:07,096 A:middle
So it looks like I'm
drawing it with CAShapeLayer,

654
00:28:07,236 --> 00:28:09,526 A:middle
which is a great way to draw
a graph, but not a great way

655
00:28:09,526 --> 00:28:11,586 A:middle
to draw an accessible graph.

656
00:28:11,836 --> 00:28:15,456 A:middle
So down here I'm actually
grabbing the point

657
00:28:15,596 --> 00:28:16,966 A:middle
and drawing it.

658
00:28:17,616 --> 00:28:19,056 A:middle
So that seems like a good place

659
00:28:19,096 --> 00:28:22,366 A:middle
to create my UIAccessibility
element.

660
00:28:23,946 --> 00:28:28,376 A:middle
So I create a UIAccessibility
element, setting its container

661
00:28:28,376 --> 00:28:30,096 A:middle
to Self, the graph view.

662
00:28:30,146 --> 00:28:35,186 A:middle
And then I set its label to a
formatted version of the date.

663
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:37,336 A:middle
So we know when it happened.

664
00:28:37,846 --> 00:28:40,456 A:middle
We will set the value to
the magnitude description.

665
00:28:40,966 --> 00:28:42,146 A:middle
That's good.

666
00:28:42,266 --> 00:28:45,976 A:middle
And then like we talked about,
I will take the frame and set it

667
00:28:45,976 --> 00:28:49,216 A:middle
to slightly wider
than the point,

668
00:28:49,746 --> 00:28:51,756 A:middle
and the full height
of the graph.

669
00:28:51,756 --> 00:28:56,226 A:middle
I will set that as the
frame after converting it

670
00:28:56,306 --> 00:28:57,676 A:middle
to screen coordinates.

671
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:03,576 A:middle
And finally add that to
an array that I had ready,

672

673
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

674
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:03,576 A:middle
And finally add that to
an array that I had ready,

675
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:06,396 A:middle
and set that as the
accessibility elements

676
00:29:06,756 --> 00:29:07,436 A:middle
for the graph view.

677
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:10,396 A:middle
So just a few more
lines of code.

678
00:29:10,936 --> 00:29:12,976 A:middle
Let's see what that looks like.

679
00:29:18,516 --> 00:29:19,066 A:middle
All right.

680
00:29:19,116 --> 00:29:22,066 A:middle
So I will triple-tap
Home and start VoiceOver.

681
00:29:22,196 --> 00:29:22,816 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: VoiceOver on.

682
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,096 A:middle
FaceTime, QuakeWatch.

683
00:29:25,936 --> 00:29:26,826 A:middle
Double-tap to open.

684
00:29:26,826 --> 00:29:27,316 A:middle
QuakeWatch.

685
00:29:27,616 --> 00:29:28,646 A:middle
Earthquakes, heading.

686
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:30,086 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: There's
those beautiful cells.

687
00:29:30,086 --> 00:29:33,386 A:middle
I will do the Magic Tap
gesture, which is two fingers,

688
00:29:33,386 --> 00:29:34,566 A:middle
double-tap on the screen.

689
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:39,196 A:middle
And there it is,
now it's a favorite.

690
00:29:39,386 --> 00:29:40,476 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: 12 kilometers.

691
00:29:40,726 --> 00:29:43,926 A:middle
California 2015.

692
00:29:44,096 --> 00:29:46,116 A:middle
11:10 a.m. Favorite.

693
00:29:46,496 --> 00:29:47,546 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: It
says it's a favorite.

694
00:29:47,646 --> 00:29:48,586 A:middle
That's good.

695
00:29:49,106 --> 00:29:50,026 A:middle
So let's add a few more.

696
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:54,196 A:middle
First, we have to wait
for earthquakes to happen.

697
00:29:54,196 --> 00:29:55,186 A:middle
All right.

698
00:29:55,856 --> 00:29:57,786 A:middle
Three should be enough.

699
00:29:58,906 --> 00:30:00,206 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: Detail,
back button.

700

701
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

702
00:29:58,906 --> 00:30:00,206 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: Detail,
back button.

703
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,366 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: Let's
see what happens

704
00:30:02,366 --> 00:30:04,806 A:middle
when we swipe around the graph.

705
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:11,416 A:middle
>> VOICEOVER: 2005, 2/5, 2015.

706
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:12,286 A:middle
Pacific Time.

707
00:30:12,566 --> 00:30:15,086 A:middle
Magnitude 0.43.

708
00:30:15,086 --> 00:30:16,276 A:middle
>> IAN FISCH: As I
slide my finger across,

709
00:30:16,276 --> 00:30:19,856 A:middle
I should hit all of them.

710
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:23,486 A:middle
And that's how you make
a graphic accessible,

711
00:30:23,486 --> 00:30:24,976 A:middle
an earthquake graph
accessible, at least.

712
00:30:25,786 --> 00:30:27,836 A:middle
So just a few lines of
code, and we were able

713
00:30:27,836 --> 00:30:32,306 A:middle
to clean all of that up.

714
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:33,786 A:middle
Let's take one more look,

715
00:30:33,786 --> 00:30:35,996 A:middle
we have the earthquake
cell is now accessible,

716
00:30:35,996 --> 00:30:37,596 A:middle
not using yellow
anymore, thank goodness.

717
00:30:38,186 --> 00:30:40,156 A:middle
The map detail is accessible.

718
00:30:40,526 --> 00:30:43,186 A:middle
We can add a favorite
using the Magic Tap,

719
00:30:44,146 --> 00:30:47,256 A:middle
and we can even explore the
graph and compare earthquakes,

720
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,256 A:middle
our favorite earthquakes,
at least.

721
00:30:50,586 --> 00:30:52,826 A:middle
So just a few lines of
code, just a few minutes,

722
00:30:52,826 --> 00:30:55,816 A:middle
and we were able to take an app
that was completely unusable

723
00:30:55,816 --> 00:30:59,526 A:middle
for VoiceOver users and make
it probably the most accessible

724
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:01,496 A:middle
earthquake tracking
app out there.

725

726
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

727
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:01,496 A:middle
earthquake tracking
app out there.

728
00:31:04,926 --> 00:31:08,156 A:middle
Remember that accessibility
is about users.

729
00:31:08,346 --> 00:31:09,896 A:middle
Thinking about how users

730
00:31:09,896 --> 00:31:11,926 A:middle
of all abilities will
interact with your app.

731
00:31:12,596 --> 00:31:14,776 A:middle
Remember everyone that's
going to be using your app

732
00:31:14,776 --> 00:31:16,686 A:middle
as you are designing it.

733
00:31:16,836 --> 00:31:18,666 A:middle
Apple has been embracing
accessibility

734
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:20,886 A:middle
for so long that's
it's expected of us

735
00:31:20,926 --> 00:31:24,176 A:middle
that we are fully accessible
with all of the products

736
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:25,116 A:middle
and features that we release.

737
00:31:25,396 --> 00:31:30,586 A:middle
And we really strive hard
to make that possible.

738
00:31:31,236 --> 00:31:33,486 A:middle
We would like to invite you
to join us in that endeavor

739
00:31:33,686 --> 00:31:37,016 A:middle
and make the ecosystem as
a whole really accessible.

740
00:31:38,466 --> 00:31:40,236 A:middle
If you would like more
information, you can search

741
00:31:40,236 --> 00:31:42,836 A:middle
for UIAccessibility
on developer.apple

742
00:31:43,196 --> 00:31:44,396 A:middle
or check the developer forums.

743
00:31:45,216 --> 00:31:47,736 A:middle
We also have an Apple
Watch session later today

744
00:31:48,256 --> 00:31:51,166 A:middle
and an Accessibility and
Speech Lab right after that.

745
00:31:51,586 --> 00:31:52,596 A:middle
So you can bring your app,

746
00:31:52,836 --> 00:31:54,866 A:middle
and we will help you
make certain parts

747
00:31:54,866 --> 00:31:56,806 A:middle
of your app accessible,
or you can just sit

748
00:31:56,806 --> 00:31:59,836 A:middle
with an accessibility expert and
go through an audit of your app

749
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:01,566 A:middle
and see how accessible
it is already.

750

751
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

752
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:01,566 A:middle
and see how accessible
it is already.

753
00:32:02,876 --> 00:32:04,126 A:middle
So we look forward to
seeing everyone there.

754
00:32:05,566 --> 00:32:06,836 A:middle
Thanks, have a great conference.

755
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,508 A:middle
[Applause]
