00:00:23,516 --> 00:00:29,856 A:middle
[Applause]

00:00:30,356 --> 00:00:31,686 A:middle
>> OLIVIER BONNET: Good
afternoon and welcome

3
00:00:31,686 --> 00:00:34,416 A:middle
to Session 704 What's
New in CloudKit.

4
00:00:35,156 --> 00:00:36,246 A:middle
My name is Olivier.

5
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:39,006 A:middle
I'm the Engineering Manager
for the iCloud Client teams.

6
00:00:39,976 --> 00:00:44,656 A:middle
So a year ago we introduced
CloudKits a brand new framework

7
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:48,476 A:middle
for you as developers to
harness of the power of iCloud.

8
00:00:49,156 --> 00:00:54,056 A:middle
We built a number of
the iOS 8 new features

9
00:00:54,056 --> 00:00:55,186 A:middle
on top of CloudKits.

10
00:00:55,526 --> 00:00:59,266 A:middle
Most visibly iCloud Drive and
iCloud Photo Library were built

11
00:00:59,736 --> 00:01:03,536 A:middle
from the ground up on top of
CloudKit but Mail Drop, HomeKit,

12

13
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

14
00:00:59,736 --> 00:01:03,536 A:middle
from the ground up on top of
CloudKit but Mail Drop, HomeKit,

15
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:07,226 A:middle
Safari history syncing, and
call history syncing were also

16
00:01:07,226 --> 00:01:08,056 A:middle
using CloudKit.

17
00:01:08,576 --> 00:01:12,416 A:middle
So a year later,
what have we seen?

18
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:17,106 A:middle
We have uploaded over
240 billion records.

19
00:01:18,176 --> 00:01:22,426 A:middle
We saved over 250 petabytes
of assets and that's coming

20
00:01:22,426 --> 00:01:25,156 A:middle
from over 300 million users.

21
00:01:26,516 --> 00:01:28,326 A:middle
So really, we couldn't
be happier

22
00:01:28,326 --> 00:01:32,716 A:middle
with how this has turned
out, with how reliable

23
00:01:32,716 --> 00:01:34,566 A:middle
and stable CloudKit
has been for us.

24
00:01:35,356 --> 00:01:39,856 A:middle
So this year, we're going to add
a couple more features to that.

25
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:44,006 A:middle
Notes is now using
CloudKit on iOS,

26
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:47,716 A:middle
and OS X to synchronize your
notes between your devices.

27
00:01:48,936 --> 00:01:50,806 A:middle
The new app we introduces
yesterday,

28
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:55,146 A:middle
News is entirely built on
the CloudKit public database.

29
00:01:56,296 --> 00:01:59,506 A:middle
Even the WWDC app is now
using CloudKit this year.

30

31
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

32
00:02:00,016 --> 00:02:02,276 A:middle
And last but not
least iCloud Backup,

33
00:02:03,016 --> 00:02:06,406 A:middle
was ported in iOS
9 to use CloudKit.

34
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:09,636 A:middle
So this is actually -- this
one is actually a bigger deal

35
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:12,306 A:middle
than it seems because iCloud
Backup is our biggest service

36
00:02:12,786 --> 00:02:16,396 A:middle
in terms of number of users,
amount of data, and the number

37
00:02:16,396 --> 00:02:19,796 A:middle
of requests per seconds.

38
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,776 A:middle
We've also heard some good
feedback from you as developers.

39
00:02:23,316 --> 00:02:26,616 A:middle
For instance, from Hipstamatic,
"With CloudKit, we were able

40
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:28,066 A:middle
to focus on building our app,

41
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:30,036 A:middle
and even squeeze
in a few extras."

42
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:33,036 A:middle
So that is exactly
why we built CloudKit.

43
00:02:33,876 --> 00:02:37,386 A:middle
To enable you as developers to
focus on building great apps,

44
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:40,596 A:middle
building awesome user
experience, without having

45
00:02:40,596 --> 00:02:43,286 A:middle
to set up a server, without
having to operate it,

46
00:02:43,676 --> 00:02:46,486 A:middle
without having to
be on call 24/7.

47
00:02:47,956 --> 00:02:52,306 A:middle
AgileBits is using CloudKit to
synchronize one password data.

48
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:53,326 A:middle
They're happy with it.

49
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,086 A:middle
Here's what they're saying:
"CloudKit is very fast,

50
00:02:56,086 --> 00:02:59,786 A:middle
efficient, and makes it easy to
detect and troubleshoot errors."

51

52
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

53
00:03:00,486 --> 00:03:05,586 A:middle
Again, that was one of our
design goals with CloudKit.

54
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:09,286 A:middle
If there's an error in the
daemon, on the network,

55
00:03:09,286 --> 00:03:12,356 A:middle
or on the server side, we will
return that error to your app

56
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:15,786 A:middle
and your app is in
charge of handling it,

57
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:19,126 A:middle
retrying it, if it makes sense.

58
00:03:19,316 --> 00:03:23,076 A:middle
Last but not least, IconFactory:
"One of the best parts

59
00:03:23,076 --> 00:03:26,236 A:middle
about CloudKit is there's no
complicated sign-in process

60
00:03:26,236 --> 00:03:26,846 A:middle
or setup."

61
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:29,636 A:middle
Again that was one of out goals.

62
00:03:30,056 --> 00:03:34,406 A:middle
Make it possible to enable
completely seamless user

63
00:03:34,406 --> 00:03:36,726 A:middle
experience, no account creation,

64
00:03:36,726 --> 00:03:38,926 A:middle
no password to enter
or remember.

65
00:03:40,676 --> 00:03:42,496 A:middle
In addition to this
good feedback,

66
00:03:42,496 --> 00:03:45,096 A:middle
we also heard some questions
from you as developers.

67
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,326 A:middle
So last year, we
introduced CloudKit.

68
00:03:47,326 --> 00:03:49,096 A:middle
We said it was free with limits.

69
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:52,746 A:middle
And so we get some questions
like, okay, what does it mean?

70
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:55,276 A:middle
What if my app reached
the limits?

71
00:03:55,816 --> 00:04:00,316 A:middle
How much will I have
to pay Apple?

72

73
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

74
00:03:55,816 --> 00:04:00,316 A:middle
How much will I have
to pay Apple?

75
00:04:00,526 --> 00:04:03,126 A:middle
Second question we got
immediately last year is like,

76
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:04,826 A:middle
okay, but what about the web?

77
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:07,576 A:middle
What if I have a web app
and I wanted to be able

78
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:12,966 A:middle
to access the same data as
my iOS and OS X CloudKit app.

79
00:04:13,876 --> 00:04:15,436 A:middle
To talk about both of those,

80
00:04:15,436 --> 00:04:17,156 A:middle
I would like to hand
it over to Eric.

81
00:04:17,526 --> 00:04:19,646 A:middle
Eric is the manager for
the iCloud Server team.

82
00:04:20,516 --> 00:04:25,586 A:middle
[Applause].

83
00:04:26,086 --> 00:04:26,636 A:middle
>> ERIC KRUGLER: Thank you.

84
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:27,826 A:middle
Well, thank you, Olivier.

85
00:04:28,016 --> 00:04:30,536 A:middle
It's terrific to be here
this afternoon to talk to you

86
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,166 A:middle
about what's new in CloudKit.

87
00:04:32,836 --> 00:04:34,786 A:middle
Let's start by answering
that first question.

88
00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:35,606 A:middle
What does it cost?

89
00:04:36,186 --> 00:04:39,226 A:middle
We are going to look at CloudKit
usage and pricing but to get

90
00:04:39,226 --> 00:04:40,136 A:middle
into that, we first need

91
00:04:40,136 --> 00:04:42,346 A:middle
to understand the
CloudKit architecture.

92
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:46,556 A:middle
So when you use CloudKit,
all of your data is stored

93
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:47,916 A:middle
in your CloudKit container.

94
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:50,256 A:middle
This is the place where
all of your data resides

95
00:04:50,536 --> 00:04:52,596 A:middle
and you can store that
data, in two different ways.

96
00:04:53,136 --> 00:04:58,226 A:middle
One is as a private database
and two is as a public database.

97
00:04:59,026 --> 00:05:02,036 A:middle
Now a private database is
the user's private data.

98

99
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

100
00:04:59,026 --> 00:05:02,036 A:middle
Now a private database is
the user's private data.

101
00:05:02,976 --> 00:05:05,226 A:middle
This example would be
the iCloud Photo Library.

102
00:05:05,396 --> 00:05:08,586 A:middle
All the photos that you
take are stored in CloudKit

103
00:05:08,996 --> 00:05:11,336 A:middle
and accessible by the user
and managed by the user,

104
00:05:11,486 --> 00:05:14,046 A:middle
and because it's the
user's private data it comes

105
00:05:14,046 --> 00:05:17,186 A:middle
out of the user's storage
quota, not the developer's.

106
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:19,946 A:middle
Now when we look at
the public database,

107
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,146 A:middle
this is application's
public data.

108
00:05:22,696 --> 00:05:25,316 A:middle
A great example of this
is the new News app

109
00:05:25,496 --> 00:05:27,146 A:middle
that we just announced
yesterday,

110
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:30,516 A:middle
where all of those news articles
are actually distributed

111
00:05:30,516 --> 00:05:33,716 A:middle
to all the news applications
via CloudKit public database

112
00:05:34,306 --> 00:05:37,016 A:middle
and because it's the
application's public data this

113
00:05:37,016 --> 00:05:39,436 A:middle
comes out of the
developer's storage quota.

114
00:05:39,846 --> 00:05:42,936 A:middle
So when we talk about pricing
and we talk about usage,

115
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:45,976 A:middle
we are really talking about
public database usage.

116
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:47,766 A:middle
So let's see what that means.

117
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:51,666 A:middle
For our public database
offering,

118
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:53,216 A:middle
we have a free offering.

119
00:05:54,106 --> 00:05:57,436 A:middle
We also have a fee structure if
you exceed those free limits.

120
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,856 A:middle
And we also have usage data.

121

122
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

123
00:06:00,756 --> 00:06:03,956 A:middle
Let's look at the free offering.

124
00:06:03,956 --> 00:06:08,626 A:middle
So you have to store assets in
the cloud, and we track that

125
00:06:09,246 --> 00:06:11,066 A:middle
and we give you ten
gigabytes to start.

126
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:13,996 A:middle
So if you have no users, you
are just starting development,

127
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:14,966 A:middle
10 gigs.

128
00:06:15,716 --> 00:06:18,296 A:middle
Now as your user
population grows,

129
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:21,496 A:middle
as your application becomes more
popular, we are going to grow

130
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:24,256 A:middle
with you and we are going to
add an additional 250 megs

131
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:27,176 A:middle
for every single user that is
using your application for free

132
00:06:27,176 --> 00:06:29,186 A:middle
and we will grow that up

133
00:06:29,296 --> 00:06:32,046 A:middle
to an astonishing 1
petabyte of storage.

134
00:06:34,156 --> 00:06:36,246 A:middle
Likewise, for the database side,

135
00:06:36,246 --> 00:06:38,716 A:middle
where you store your record
data, we will start you

136
00:06:38,716 --> 00:06:42,056 A:middle
with 100 megs and we will
grow that at 2.5 megs per user

137
00:06:42,056 --> 00:06:44,136 A:middle
and we will go up to
10 terabytes for free.

138
00:06:45,316 --> 00:06:48,956 A:middle
Now in addition to storage,
we also have data transfer.

139
00:06:49,756 --> 00:06:50,786 A:middle
So as you're uploading

140
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:53,186 A:middle
and downloading your assets
you are consuming bandwidth

141
00:06:53,236 --> 00:06:56,336 A:middle
and we will start
you with 2 gigabytes

142
00:06:56,596 --> 00:06:59,106 A:middle
of data transfer per
month in and out.

143

144
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

145
00:07:00,076 --> 00:07:02,856 A:middle
And like the others we will grow
that as you have more users.

146
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:05,066 A:middle
So we will add an extra 50
megs per user per month.

147
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:08,996 A:middle
And we will allow you to
grow up to 200 terabytes

148
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,936 A:middle
of data transfer per
month all for free.

149
00:07:12,686 --> 00:07:15,856 A:middle
Now for database, it's
a little different.

150
00:07:16,356 --> 00:07:19,106 A:middle
We actually measure it on
a request per second basis.

151
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,716 A:middle
So we are going to start you

152
00:07:20,716 --> 00:07:22,976 A:middle
at 40 requests per second,
which is very large.

153
00:07:23,816 --> 00:07:25,486 A:middle
And just like the
others, we will grow

154
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,486 A:middle
with the number of users.

155
00:07:27,856 --> 00:07:29,126 A:middle
And we will do that
in increments

156
00:07:29,126 --> 00:07:31,976 A:middle
of 10 requests per second
for each 100,000 users

157
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:36,386 A:middle
up to 400 requests per second
for free, and what's important

158
00:07:36,386 --> 00:07:38,386 A:middle
to note about the
request per second is

159
00:07:38,386 --> 00:07:39,686 A:middle
that it's actually
a throttle limit.

160
00:07:40,346 --> 00:07:42,976 A:middle
So if for some reason your
application hits these limits,

161
00:07:42,976 --> 00:07:46,176 A:middle
we will actually send you
back a throttling error back

162
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:47,926 A:middle
to your client to tell
you you've hit the limits.

163
00:07:48,476 --> 00:07:50,696 A:middle
And then we will talk
in a bit about how

164
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:52,666 A:middle
to make sure that
doesn't happen.

165
00:07:53,496 --> 00:07:54,706 A:middle
All right.

166
00:07:54,796 --> 00:07:56,746 A:middle
Now, if you do go
over those limits,

167
00:07:56,866 --> 00:07:58,226 A:middle
there is a way to pay for more.

168
00:07:58,546 --> 00:08:00,216 A:middle
And that's our public
database fees.

169

170
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

171
00:07:58,546 --> 00:08:00,216 A:middle
And that's our public
database fees.

172
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:03,406 A:middle
Now, this is over and above
what we give you for free.

173
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:06,476 A:middle
So it's the incremental delta
between what you get for free,

174
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:07,706 A:middle
and what you are using.

175
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:11,536 A:middle
So for assets, it's $0.03
per gigabyte per month,

176
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:14,136 A:middle
for database, $3.00
per gig per month.

177
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:16,066 A:middle
On the transfer side,

178
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:18,416 A:middle
for transferring
assets $0.10 per gig

179
00:08:19,146 --> 00:08:20,886 A:middle
and on the database
request rates,

180
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:23,946 A:middle
we'll add an extra 10
requests per second for $100,

181
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:26,726 A:middle
and so you can increment that
number up to get to the level

182
00:08:26,726 --> 00:08:29,106 A:middle
that allows your
application to work smoothly

183
00:08:29,106 --> 00:08:30,266 A:middle
if you hit the free limits.

184
00:08:30,796 --> 00:08:35,726 A:middle
And, of course, push is free.

185
00:08:36,035 --> 00:08:40,166 A:middle
Okay? So now let's
take a look at a demo

186
00:08:40,405 --> 00:08:42,285 A:middle
of the CloudKit calculator.

187
00:08:42,385 --> 00:08:46,196 A:middle
This is on
developer.apple.com/cloudkit.

188
00:08:46,196 --> 00:08:47,916 A:middle
You can play around with
this if you haven't already.

189
00:08:47,946 --> 00:08:50,526 A:middle
I'm going to invite
Ramiro Calvo to help drive,

190
00:08:50,526 --> 00:08:52,696 A:middle
because apparently I can drive
and talk at the same time.

191
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:57,046 A:middle
And he's going to help
us walk through this.

192
00:08:57,046 --> 00:09:00,916 A:middle
If you go to the calculator,
you notice that right now,

193

194
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

195
00:08:57,046 --> 00:09:00,916 A:middle
If you go to the calculator,
you notice that right now,

196
00:09:00,996 --> 00:09:04,366 A:middle
we have zero active users.

197
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:10,516 A:middle
Okay? And the numbers that you
see beneath it tell you how much

198
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:11,876 A:middle
storage we are getting
to you for free.

199
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:13,996 A:middle
For start, this matches
what we just talked about.

200
00:09:13,996 --> 00:09:15,486 A:middle
There's 10 gigs of
asset storage,

201
00:09:15,486 --> 00:09:19,236 A:middle
100 megs of database storage, 2
gigs of data transfer per month,

202
00:09:19,396 --> 00:09:20,786 A:middle
and 40 requests per second.

203
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,666 A:middle
Now let's say my
application starts taking off

204
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,986 A:middle
and I have 100,000 users.

205
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:27,716 A:middle
So we're going to
grow that to 100,000,

206
00:09:28,156 --> 00:09:30,496 A:middle
and you will notice we gave
you a lot more storage,

207
00:09:31,086 --> 00:09:33,386 A:middle
and if you look below
at the bottom there,

208
00:09:33,436 --> 00:09:35,946 A:middle
and Ramiro maybe you can scroll
up a little bit, you're going

209
00:09:35,946 --> 00:09:41,186 A:middle
to notice that the
cost is actually $0.

210
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,316 A:middle
Ramiro is it possible to
scroll it up a little bit.

211
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:43,636 A:middle
Thank you.

212
00:09:44,746 --> 00:09:46,626 A:middle
Okay? So we have $0 cost.

213
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,946 A:middle
Now let's say we go up
to half a million users.

214
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:56,736 A:middle
Okay? Now, once again we
have a lot of storage.

215
00:09:56,736 --> 00:09:58,596 A:middle
Now we are up to 125 terabytes.

216
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:02,566 A:middle
We're still growing and the
cost to you is still zero.

217

218
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

219
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:02,566 A:middle
We're still growing and the
cost to you is still zero.

220
00:10:03,606 --> 00:10:04,856 A:middle
Let's take it to
a million users.

221
00:10:06,236 --> 00:10:08,176 A:middle
Okay? So now we got a
lot of users in here.

222
00:10:08,796 --> 00:10:10,226 A:middle
We got a lot of storage.

223
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:12,586 A:middle
We are up to 250
terabytes of data.

224
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:15,126 A:middle
Lots of requests per second.

225
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:15,916 A:middle
It's still free.

226
00:10:16,446 --> 00:10:18,016 A:middle
Let's take it to
4 million users.

227
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:22,066 A:middle
Okay. So now we are at 4
million users and you are going

228
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:23,346 A:middle
to see some very
large numbers here.

229
00:10:24,246 --> 00:10:27,496 A:middle
We are up to the petabyte
of storage, 10 terabytes

230
00:10:27,886 --> 00:10:31,376 A:middle
of database storage,
200 terabytes per month

231
00:10:31,376 --> 00:10:33,996 A:middle
of data transfer,
this is a lot of data,

232
00:10:33,996 --> 00:10:36,126 A:middle
and all of this still
costs you nothing.

233
00:10:36,846 --> 00:10:39,126 A:middle
Now if you recall from
the pricing slide,

234
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:41,086 A:middle
at some point, we hit a limit.

235
00:10:41,366 --> 00:10:42,776 A:middle
And that limit looks
about right here.

236
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,426 A:middle
You got about a petabyte
of storage.

237
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:46,026 A:middle
That's what we said was
the max you can get to.

238
00:10:46,026 --> 00:10:49,716 A:middle
So, as we add more users then
there must be some costs.

239
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,036 A:middle
Let's take it to
5 million users.

240
00:10:51,546 --> 00:10:56,696 A:middle
And the cost here is --
well, it's still free.

241
00:10:57,546 --> 00:10:59,206 A:middle
So what's going on here?

242

243
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

244
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:03,986 A:middle
Well, if your application on
average uses less per user

245
00:11:03,986 --> 00:11:06,106 A:middle
that we give you, it
still costs you nothing.

246
00:11:06,736 --> 00:11:07,826 A:middle
And because it's an average,

247
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:10,316 A:middle
that means that some users
may use more than the average,

248
00:11:10,376 --> 00:11:12,666 A:middle
and some may use less and
that's perfectly fine.

249
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:14,146 A:middle
It still costs you nothing.

250
00:11:14,536 --> 00:11:16,576 A:middle
So we could take this all the
way up to 10 million here,

251
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:20,186 A:middle
and demonstrate that it still
costs you nothing, all right?

252
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:23,776 A:middle
If you just architect your
application correctly to stay

253
00:11:23,776 --> 00:11:25,696 A:middle
within the free limits
that we give you.

254
00:11:25,696 --> 00:11:26,516 A:middle
All right?

255
00:11:26,516 --> 00:11:29,556 A:middle
So that's how we calculate
things, use the calculator

256
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:30,606 A:middle
if you would like
more information.

257
00:11:31,206 --> 00:11:31,866 A:middle
Thanks Ramiro.

258
00:11:33,516 --> 00:11:39,756 A:middle
[Applause]

259
00:11:40,256 --> 00:11:40,906 A:middle
All right.

260
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:43,106 A:middle
The next question is how do
I know how much I'm using?

261
00:11:43,446 --> 00:11:45,646 A:middle
The CloudKit Dashboard
is the place

262
00:11:45,646 --> 00:11:46,856 A:middle
where we put this information.

263
00:11:47,076 --> 00:11:49,516 A:middle
The Dashboard is a web
application that you get

264
00:11:49,516 --> 00:11:52,076 A:middle
to at developer.apple.com.

265
00:11:52,116 --> 00:11:54,146 A:middle
It's a place that you get
to look at your container

266
00:11:54,446 --> 00:11:58,596 A:middle
and you get to do things like
manage your record types,

267
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,066 A:middle
manage whether they are in
development or production,

268

269
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

270
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,066 A:middle
manage whether they are in
development or production,

271
00:12:01,976 --> 00:12:03,906 A:middle
and we have added some
new functionality.

272
00:12:04,486 --> 00:12:07,556 A:middle
So if you take a look
at what we've added,

273
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,356 A:middle
there's a new section
called Usage.

274
00:12:10,966 --> 00:12:12,586 A:middle
And you can go there
and take a look

275
00:12:12,586 --> 00:12:15,036 A:middle
at how your application
container is performing.

276
00:12:16,776 --> 00:12:19,036 A:middle
If we drill in, we have a couple

277
00:12:19,036 --> 00:12:20,176 A:middle
of different ways
to look at the data.

278
00:12:20,176 --> 00:12:23,306 A:middle
We can look at it at a daily
level or a monthly level.

279
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:28,376 A:middle
And if you look at the daily
information, the very top thing

280
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:30,636 A:middle
on the graphs is
the number of users

281
00:12:30,636 --> 00:12:31,936 A:middle
and this is really important

282
00:12:32,296 --> 00:12:34,906 A:middle
because we calculate how
much free stuff we give you,

283
00:12:34,906 --> 00:12:36,066 A:middle
based on the numbers you have.

284
00:12:36,066 --> 00:12:37,396 A:middle
So you want to look
at that first.

285
00:12:38,396 --> 00:12:40,066 A:middle
Now, you'll also
notice on the right,

286
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:42,076 A:middle
you have some dashed
lines over this

287
00:12:42,076 --> 00:12:44,916 A:middle
because what we are giving you
is two months worth of data,

288
00:12:44,986 --> 00:12:46,956 A:middle
the prior month and
the current month.

289
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,826 A:middle
The current month,
depending on where you are at,

290
00:12:48,826 --> 00:12:50,376 A:middle
some of that is going
to be a forecast.

291
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,786 A:middle
And we're going to
forecast that for you based

292
00:12:52,786 --> 00:12:55,136 A:middle
on the prior activity
of your container.

293
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,616 A:middle
Now, below this,
is another graph,

294
00:12:58,616 --> 00:13:00,866 A:middle
which shows our requests
per second and day by day,

295

296
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

297
00:12:58,616 --> 00:13:00,866 A:middle
which shows our requests
per second and day by day,

298
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:03,686 A:middle
we show you what the peak
request per second we're seeing

299
00:13:03,686 --> 00:13:04,656 A:middle
on any given day is.

300
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:09,836 A:middle
Now you can also select monthly
and if you choose monthly,

301
00:13:09,946 --> 00:13:12,686 A:middle
you're going to get a
12-month view month by month

302
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:14,496 A:middle
of the activity of
your application,

303
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,246 A:middle
and the current month
is typically going to be

304
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:19,966 A:middle
in a forecast where
it shows a dashed line

305
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:21,716 A:middle
and basically what we
expect it's going to be

306
00:13:21,716 --> 00:13:22,516 A:middle
for the current month.

307
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,846 A:middle
Now, let's scroll down to look
at a couple of other graphs.

308
00:13:27,026 --> 00:13:29,586 A:middle
Here's database storage,
as well as asset storage.

309
00:13:30,286 --> 00:13:31,936 A:middle
And you'll notice
something different here.

310
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,006 A:middle
You will see two lines.

311
00:13:33,136 --> 00:13:35,656 A:middle
There's a red line on top
and a yellow line just below.

312
00:13:36,086 --> 00:13:39,876 A:middle
The red line represents
the amount of free storage

313
00:13:39,876 --> 00:13:40,646 A:middle
that we are giving you.

314
00:13:40,646 --> 00:13:44,376 A:middle
And the yellow line represents
how much you are actually using.

315
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:47,256 A:middle
So the game all of you
guys get to play is how

316
00:13:47,256 --> 00:13:50,766 A:middle
to keep the yellow line
beneath the red line, right?

317
00:13:50,856 --> 00:13:53,486 A:middle
The way that you can actually
see this information is

318
00:13:53,486 --> 00:13:56,586 A:middle
by clicking over here on
the section on the right

319
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:57,806 A:middle
where the quota box is.

320
00:13:57,806 --> 00:13:58,856 A:middle
It's off by default.

321
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:00,116 A:middle
You can just turn
it on if you like.

322

323
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

324
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:00,116 A:middle
You can just turn
it on if you like.

325
00:14:00,596 --> 00:14:02,556 A:middle
The reason it is off by
default is because we give you

326
00:14:02,556 --> 00:14:05,966 A:middle
so much free storage, if you
click that, the scale changes

327
00:14:05,966 --> 00:14:08,766 A:middle
and basically your usage looks
like a flat line relative

328
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:10,146 A:middle
to the amount of free
storage that we give you.

329
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:12,346 A:middle
So please go ahead
and try that out.

330
00:14:13,746 --> 00:14:16,066 A:middle
So the CloudKit Dashboard
provides two things.

331
00:14:16,736 --> 00:14:19,986 A:middle
It's a new section to
keep track of usage data

332
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,796 A:middle
and also give you
the free limits.

333
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:27,516 A:middle
And it's available now in beta
release at developer.apple.com.

334
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:28,756 A:middle
So if you already
have a container,

335
00:14:28,756 --> 00:14:31,476 A:middle
you can go there today and
you can see the usage data

336
00:14:32,146 --> 00:14:32,856 A:middle
on the Dashboard.

337
00:14:38,356 --> 00:14:39,396 A:middle
All right.

338
00:14:39,396 --> 00:14:41,916 A:middle
The second question that
was asked is what about web?

339
00:14:42,556 --> 00:14:44,146 A:middle
Well, I'm pleased
to introduce you

340
00:14:44,256 --> 00:14:46,886 A:middle
to the new CloudKit
Web Services.

341
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:48,076 A:middle
This is the way --

342
00:14:49,516 --> 00:14:54,556 A:middle
[Applause].

343
00:14:55,056 --> 00:14:55,286 A:middle
Yeah, all right!

344
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:57,866 A:middle
This is the way that you
can take your amazing iOS

345
00:14:57,866 --> 00:15:00,576 A:middle
and OS X applications and you
can extend them to the web.

346

347
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

348
00:14:57,866 --> 00:15:00,576 A:middle
and OS X applications and you
can extend them to the web.

349
00:15:01,476 --> 00:15:02,546 A:middle
So how does this work?

350
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:04,716 A:middle
Well, first lets talk
about the features.

351
00:15:04,716 --> 00:15:09,016 A:middle
You get a full CloudKit
API via JSON and HTTPS,

352
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,346 A:middle
we also provide CloudKit
JS Library

353
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:13,806 A:middle
which is absolutely the best way

354
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:15,696 A:middle
to quickly create
web applications,

355
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:19,126 A:middle
and we provide Web Sign in
with Apple ID is the way

356
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,606 A:middle
that your users will
authenticate

357
00:15:20,606 --> 00:15:22,566 A:middle
when they use your web app.

358
00:15:24,496 --> 00:15:25,566 A:middle
Now, how does this work?

359
00:15:25,566 --> 00:15:30,116 A:middle
If you look today, you'll
see your application running

360
00:15:30,256 --> 00:15:32,146 A:middle
on iOS and OS X.

361
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:34,076 A:middle
It interacts with
CloudKit the framework,

362
00:15:34,496 --> 00:15:36,946 A:middle
which behind the scenes talks
to our CloudKit servers.

363
00:15:38,276 --> 00:15:42,186 A:middle
What we have introduced
today is the ability for you

364
00:15:42,186 --> 00:15:43,886 A:middle
to create your own
web application,

365
00:15:43,886 --> 00:15:47,896 A:middle
running in a web browser and
talking over JSON and HTTPS,

366
00:15:48,746 --> 00:15:51,666 A:middle
to our CloudKit Web Services
which lets you then talk

367
00:15:51,766 --> 00:15:54,256 A:middle
to the same exact
CloudKit servers

368
00:15:54,626 --> 00:15:57,526 A:middle
that your native applications
are talking to on iOS and OS X.

369
00:15:57,526 --> 00:16:00,726 A:middle
Now, it's important to
understand about the JSON

370

371
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

372
00:15:57,526 --> 00:16:00,726 A:middle
Now, it's important to
understand about the JSON

373
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:04,026 A:middle
and the HTTPS piece of this,
it's just a specification.

374
00:16:04,706 --> 00:16:05,576 A:middle
There's no code.

375
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:08,006 A:middle
Effectively, it's up to
you as a developer to look

376
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:09,116 A:middle
at that specification.

377
00:16:09,746 --> 00:16:12,526 A:middle
You get to construct your own
end points, hitting endpoints.

378
00:16:12,836 --> 00:16:16,216 A:middle
You get to create your URLs and
construct your JSONs that goes

379
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:19,426 A:middle
in the bodies that go up in
a request, you get back JSON

380
00:16:19,426 --> 00:16:22,436 A:middle
in responses, you parse that,
you deal with asset uploads

381
00:16:22,436 --> 00:16:24,766 A:middle
and downloads, retry
logic and on and on.

382
00:16:25,216 --> 00:16:28,846 A:middle
But a much better way to do
this is using the CloudKit

383
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,296 A:middle
JS framework.

384
00:16:30,996 --> 00:16:34,836 A:middle
CloudKit JS gives you a
JavaScript API that you can use

385
00:16:35,016 --> 00:16:38,126 A:middle
that shields you from all
the complexities of the HTTPS

386
00:16:38,126 --> 00:16:40,676 A:middle
and JSON protocol
that sits behind it.

387
00:16:41,046 --> 00:16:43,856 A:middle
And you can use either one,
but you are probably crazy

388
00:16:43,856 --> 00:16:44,656 A:middle
if you go the other route.

389
00:16:44,656 --> 00:16:46,806 A:middle
So please use CloudKit JS.

390
00:16:47,896 --> 00:16:49,206 A:middle
So what does this give you?

391
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,026 A:middle
Well all right, it
gives you full public

392
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:52,436 A:middle
and private database access.

393
00:16:53,036 --> 00:16:54,846 A:middle
It gives you all those
record applications.

394
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:57,266 A:middle
It lets you upload
and download assets.

395
00:16:57,736 --> 00:16:59,566 A:middle
It lets you execute queries.

396

397
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

398
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:03,086 A:middle
It even lets you do
subscriptions and notifications,

399
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:06,976 A:middle
which means that I can actually
get an asynchronous event

400
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:09,726 A:middle
into my web application,
just like you get pushes

401
00:17:09,935 --> 00:17:12,406 A:middle
to tell you something has
changed or to notify you

402
00:17:12,526 --> 00:17:14,476 A:middle
of some other event,
so you don't have

403
00:17:14,476 --> 00:17:16,796 A:middle
to have users hitting the
refresh button or pulling

404
00:17:16,796 --> 00:17:17,896 A:middle
from your web application.

405
00:17:18,925 --> 00:17:20,586 A:middle
It also has user
discoverability,

406
00:17:21,445 --> 00:17:23,876 A:middle
and it has the ability to answer
the question what's changed

407
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,695 A:middle
since within custom zones
which gives you sync semantics.

408
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:31,336 A:middle
In short, what this gives
you is full compatibility

409
00:17:31,336 --> 00:17:32,806 A:middle
and capability as what you get

410
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:40,316 A:middle
on the native CloudKit
on iOS and OS X.

411
00:17:40,836 --> 00:17:44,896 A:middle
Now, CloudKit JS, as I mentioned
before is the absolute best way

412
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:46,196 A:middle
to develop web applications.

413
00:17:46,196 --> 00:17:47,246 A:middle
It's a JavaScript API.

414
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:50,756 A:middle
It matches the native
CloudKit API as much

415
00:17:50,756 --> 00:17:52,746 A:middle
as you can make JavaScript
match Objective-C,

416
00:17:52,746 --> 00:17:54,456 A:middle
but you know we did our
best, it's pretty close.

417
00:17:55,106 --> 00:17:56,566 A:middle
There's no intermediate servers.

418
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:59,316 A:middle
So you can create your
JavaScript application

419
00:17:59,626 --> 00:18:02,266 A:middle
and you can talk directly
to the CloudKit, you know --

420

421
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

422
00:17:59,626 --> 00:18:02,266 A:middle
and you can talk directly
to the CloudKit, you know --

423
00:18:02,266 --> 00:18:06,536 A:middle
the CloudKit Web Service behind
the scenes and you don't have

424
00:18:06,536 --> 00:18:08,606 A:middle
to run your own servers
or anything in the middle

425
00:18:08,936 --> 00:18:12,236 A:middle
and it's how we built
the new Notes web app

426
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,606 A:middle
that you saw demonstrated
the other day.

427
00:18:15,926 --> 00:18:20,966 A:middle
And what I would like to do is
have Ramiro Calvo join me again.

428
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:22,146 A:middle
We're going to give you a demo

429
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:25,836 A:middle
of the new Notes web app
based on CloudKit JS.

430
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:33,106 A:middle
All right.

431
00:18:33,106 --> 00:18:35,576 A:middle
So we are going to
start at icloud.com.

432
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:36,536 A:middle
This is our spring board.

433
00:18:36,536 --> 00:18:38,326 A:middle
There's a bunch of web
apps sitting here already.

434
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:42,006 A:middle
You'll notice some familiar ones
we have Photos and iCloud Drive.

435
00:18:42,396 --> 00:18:43,466 A:middle
Those are two applications

436
00:18:43,466 --> 00:18:45,626 A:middle
that already exist
on top of CloudKit.

437
00:18:46,306 --> 00:18:50,316 A:middle
And with iOS 9, the new Notes
application is also built

438
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:51,216 A:middle
on CloudKit.

439
00:18:51,726 --> 00:18:54,976 A:middle
And so we've created a new web
application that sits on top

440
00:18:54,976 --> 00:18:57,016 A:middle
of CloudKit, and
gives all of those --

441
00:18:57,016 --> 00:18:59,846 A:middle
that rich capability that you
saw demonstrated at the keynote.

442

443
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

444
00:19:00,346 --> 00:19:01,906 A:middle
So Ramiro will click in.

445
00:19:02,146 --> 00:19:02,846 A:middle
Here's the web app.

446
00:19:03,546 --> 00:19:05,706 A:middle
You're going to see some
great content in here.

447
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,016 A:middle
You see images.

448
00:19:07,016 --> 00:19:08,016 A:middle
You can do videos.

449
00:19:08,476 --> 00:19:09,606 A:middle
There's check boxes.

450
00:19:10,076 --> 00:19:12,196 A:middle
All of these things are
available in the new Notes app

451
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,986 A:middle
and they are just CloudKit
assets and records.

452
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:18,846 A:middle
Okay? So what we are going to do
now is create a brand new node.

453
00:19:19,646 --> 00:19:21,986 A:middle
And since we are at the
developers conference,

454
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:23,476 A:middle
we should probably
have a what to do

455
00:19:23,476 --> 00:19:25,636 A:middle
at the developers
conference while we are here.

456
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,876 A:middle
So let's start out
with maybe one

457
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,436 A:middle
of the more important
things, which is we need

458
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,036 A:middle
to make sure we attend
all the after parties.

459
00:19:33,366 --> 00:19:38,286 A:middle
Let's get that one on the list.

460
00:19:38,286 --> 00:19:41,716 A:middle
Now after we get done with
attending the after parties,

461
00:19:41,716 --> 00:19:46,586 A:middle
we really need to go to
developer.apple.com/cloudkit

462
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:49,386 A:middle
and take a look at all
the amazing documentation,

463
00:19:49,476 --> 00:19:51,336 A:middle
including this amazing
presentation,

464
00:19:51,336 --> 00:19:54,156 A:middle
where you are going to be
able to find information,

465
00:19:54,156 --> 00:19:56,936 A:middle
documentation and everything
about CloudKit itself as well

466
00:19:56,936 --> 00:19:58,916 A:middle
as the new CloudKit
Web Services.

467
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:02,316 A:middle
Once we get through that,
we should really go off

468

469
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

470
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:02,316 A:middle
Once we get through that,
we should really go off

471
00:20:02,606 --> 00:20:05,956 A:middle
and create our first
CloudKit web application.

472
00:20:06,516 --> 00:20:11,346 A:middle
And once we create that, well,
we should basically move on

473
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:14,206 A:middle
and do our best to try
to hit those free limits

474
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:15,656 A:middle
and that might actually
take a while.

475
00:20:15,656 --> 00:20:17,976 A:middle
So I don't think we
will check that one off.

476
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:19,966 A:middle
But I have attended
at least one party.

477
00:20:19,966 --> 00:20:24,256 A:middle
So I think we can check
that first one off, Ramiro.

478
00:20:24,776 --> 00:20:26,426 A:middle
And complete this
web experience.

479
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:30,716 A:middle
Now, let's go over to
iOS, which is an iPad,

480
00:20:31,226 --> 00:20:33,546 A:middle
running the new Notes
application.

481
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:35,106 A:middle
We will open this up.

482
00:20:35,506 --> 00:20:39,286 A:middle
And you will see that same
kitchen remodel project

483
00:20:39,286 --> 00:20:40,116 A:middle
as we saw before.

484
00:20:40,116 --> 00:20:42,956 A:middle
And here's our new things to
do at WWDC that we just typed.

485
00:20:43,436 --> 00:20:44,736 A:middle
It showed up automatically.

486
00:20:44,736 --> 00:20:46,086 A:middle
It's the same data, right?

487
00:20:46,086 --> 00:20:47,766 A:middle
It's just that we have
a web interface to it,

488
00:20:47,766 --> 00:20:50,536 A:middle
where you can have your
native iOS interface to it.

489
00:20:50,536 --> 00:20:53,786 A:middle
Now, we will make a few
more changes in here.

490
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:56,576 A:middle
I have already gone to
developer.apple.com.

491
00:20:56,576 --> 00:20:59,976 A:middle
Ramiro you have clearly
developed an amazing CloudKit

492
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:04,136 A:middle
web app with the Notes app
and why don't we now go back

493

494
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

495
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:04,136 A:middle
web app with the Notes app
and why don't we now go back

496
00:21:04,136 --> 00:21:06,156 A:middle
and take a look at the web

497
00:21:06,646 --> 00:21:08,976 A:middle
and see what happens,
you know, over there.

498
00:21:09,586 --> 00:21:11,516 A:middle
Now, if all things happen,

499
00:21:11,516 --> 00:21:12,836 A:middle
you will notice everything
got checked.

500
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:14,156 A:middle
That was, again,

501
00:21:14,156 --> 00:21:16,256 A:middle
that notification
experience I talked about.

502
00:21:16,686 --> 00:21:19,556 A:middle
The notification, push
notification happened.

503
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,916 A:middle
The web application
picked that up,

504
00:21:22,256 --> 00:21:24,466 A:middle
and automatically updated itself
and showed you the changes.

505
00:21:25,186 --> 00:21:28,156 A:middle
And that's the new Notes
web app that's available

506
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:29,916 A:middle
on iOS 9 and icloud.com.

507
00:21:30,486 --> 00:21:30,946 A:middle
Thanks Ramiro.

508
00:21:31,516 --> 00:21:41,496 A:middle
[Applause]

509
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:43,416 A:middle
>> ERIC KRUGLER: Now,
if your users are going

510
00:21:43,506 --> 00:21:45,156 A:middle
to use the application,
they have to sign in.

511
00:21:46,126 --> 00:21:48,336 A:middle
And so we are going to jump
right in to taking a look

512
00:21:48,336 --> 00:21:50,276 A:middle
at what that might look like
in your web application.

513
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:53,396 A:middle
So, first, you need
some sort of a button

514
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:54,956 A:middle
to ask the user to sign in.

515
00:21:55,066 --> 00:21:55,866 A:middle
This is your UI.

516
00:21:57,206 --> 00:22:00,806 A:middle
Now when the user clicks this,
a new browser window is going

517

518
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

519
00:21:57,206 --> 00:22:00,806 A:middle
Now when the user clicks this,
a new browser window is going

520
00:22:00,806 --> 00:22:03,366 A:middle
to pop up and this
browser window is owned

521
00:22:03,526 --> 00:22:04,676 A:middle
and managed by Apple.

522
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:08,686 A:middle
And this is because the ID
and password is only exchanged

523
00:22:08,686 --> 00:22:09,836 A:middle
between the user and Apple.

524
00:22:09,836 --> 00:22:11,416 A:middle
The developer never sees this.

525
00:22:12,236 --> 00:22:14,566 A:middle
And there's a few other
things that show up further

526
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,106 A:middle
down on the login page.

527
00:22:21,856 --> 00:22:23,396 A:middle
So first, there's
"Keep me signed in."

528
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,046 A:middle
So the user can opt in to
say I want to stay signed

529
00:22:26,046 --> 00:22:27,076 A:middle
in for up to two weeks.

530
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:29,876 A:middle
There's a "Forgot
Apple ID or password?"

531
00:22:29,876 --> 00:22:31,736 A:middle
So if the user has
forgotten their ID,

532
00:22:32,036 --> 00:22:34,536 A:middle
we'll manage the whole
flow of helping them

533
00:22:34,536 --> 00:22:36,866 A:middle
to remember their
password or reset it.

534
00:22:37,326 --> 00:22:41,206 A:middle
And finally, if the user
is brand new to, you know,

535
00:22:41,206 --> 00:22:43,766 A:middle
the Apple ecosystem, they
don't have an Apple ID at all,

536
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,666 A:middle
they can create an Apple
ID right here in the flow

537
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,296 A:middle
and they will get
an Apple account

538
00:22:48,466 --> 00:22:49,646 A:middle
that they can then
use immediately

539
00:22:49,646 --> 00:22:50,576 A:middle
with your application.

540
00:22:51,146 --> 00:22:57,586 A:middle
So the CloudKit Web Service
offering includes iCloud

541
00:22:57,586 --> 00:23:01,016 A:middle
web-only accounts what I just
described, which offers 1 gig

542

543
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

544
00:22:57,586 --> 00:23:01,016 A:middle
web-only accounts what I just
described, which offers 1 gig

545
00:23:01,326 --> 00:23:03,716 A:middle
of free storage for
private database usage.

546
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,706 A:middle
And if that same user then
goes to iOS or OS X and sets

547
00:23:07,706 --> 00:23:09,926 A:middle
up their account there,
it automatically upgrades

548
00:23:09,926 --> 00:23:12,916 A:middle
to the 5 gig iCloud
account immediately.

549
00:23:15,196 --> 00:23:20,816 A:middle
Public database usage is the
same for iOS, OS X and web.

550
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,816 A:middle
There's no difference,
so a request made

551
00:23:22,816 --> 00:23:24,496 A:middle
on the web is the
same as a request made

552
00:23:24,646 --> 00:23:26,386 A:middle
on your phone or on your Mac.

553
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,036 A:middle
Storage is the same way.

554
00:23:28,036 --> 00:23:32,176 A:middle
So when you go to the storage
areas or the usage information

555
00:23:32,216 --> 00:23:34,266 A:middle
on the Dashboard,
there's no distinction.

556
00:23:34,436 --> 00:23:35,296 A:middle
It's all put together.

557
00:23:35,856 --> 00:23:41,966 A:middle
We do require a comparable
application for iOS or OS X.

558
00:23:42,726 --> 00:23:45,856 A:middle
The purpose of the Web Services
is to take your amazing iOS

559
00:23:45,856 --> 00:23:48,406 A:middle
and OS X applications and
extend them to the web.

560
00:23:48,976 --> 00:23:52,926 A:middle
And it's available now in beta

561
00:23:52,926 --> 00:23:55,836 A:middle
for development,
releasing with iOS 9.

562
00:23:57,116 --> 00:24:00,296 A:middle
And that's it for
CloudKit Web Services.

563

564
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

565
00:23:57,116 --> 00:24:00,296 A:middle
And that's it for
CloudKit Web Services.

566
00:24:00,296 --> 00:24:03,106 A:middle
What I would like to do is
ask Olivier to come back

567
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:04,486 A:middle
and close out the session.

568
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:04,976 A:middle
Thank you very much.

569
00:24:05,516 --> 00:24:11,446 A:middle
[Applause].

570
00:24:11,946 --> 00:24:12,946 A:middle
>> OLIVIER BONNET: Thank
you very much, Eric.

571
00:24:12,946 --> 00:24:14,636 A:middle
So that's it.

572
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:18,766 A:middle
We are very excited to see
what kind of application,

573
00:24:18,766 --> 00:24:21,196 A:middle
what kind of amazing
ideas you guys will build

574
00:24:21,196 --> 00:24:23,656 A:middle
on top of CloudKits.

575
00:24:23,926 --> 00:24:27,586 A:middle
As Eric mentioned, we have
new web page developer

576
00:24:27,586 --> 00:24:29,406 A:middle
at apple.com/cloudkit.

577
00:24:29,406 --> 00:24:33,276 A:middle
It aggregates all the data we
have and all the documentation,

578
00:24:33,276 --> 00:24:36,776 A:middle
the reference library, the
simple code we have on CloudKit,

579
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:41,016 A:middle
both the new server, web APIs,
and the client framework.

580
00:24:41,866 --> 00:24:44,536 A:middle
In addition to the
usual technical support,

581
00:24:44,536 --> 00:24:46,886 A:middle
and forums, URLs.

582
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:52,116 A:middle
If all of those fail, you
can email cloudkit@apple.com

583
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:53,206 A:middle
for general inquiries.

584
00:24:54,566 --> 00:24:57,626 A:middle
We have two more
sessions this week.

585
00:24:57,906 --> 00:25:01,066 A:middle
The first one is tomorrow
and we will do a deep dive

586

587
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

588
00:24:57,906 --> 00:25:01,066 A:middle
The first one is tomorrow
and we will do a deep dive

589
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,966 A:middle
on the CloudKit JS and
the Web Services API.

590
00:25:03,966 --> 00:25:09,846 A:middle
And then we have on Thursday
at 4:30, we have CloudKit Tips

591
00:25:09,846 --> 00:25:14,656 A:middle
and Tricks session, where
we'll do a best practices,

592
00:25:14,716 --> 00:25:18,076 A:middle
do's and don'ts and
as well a couple

593
00:25:18,306 --> 00:25:22,466 A:middle
of nice improvements we made
to the client's framework

594
00:25:22,466 --> 00:25:25,446 A:middle
in iOS 9, and OS X El Capitan.

595
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:30,786 A:middle
We have a number of labs
during the rest of the week.

596
00:25:31,366 --> 00:25:33,766 A:middle
On Wednesday, Thursday,
and Friday at 9:00,

597
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:35,116 A:middle
we'll have client engineers.

598
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,356 A:middle
We will have server engineers.

599
00:25:36,816 --> 00:25:40,966 A:middle
I promise some of them
will even be awake at 9:00.

600
00:25:40,966 --> 00:25:43,796 A:middle
Please come and with your
questions, with your ideas.

601
00:25:43,796 --> 00:25:46,726 A:middle
We're happy to talk about
data mall, about what type

602
00:25:46,896 --> 00:25:49,546 A:middle
of apps you guys have in mind,

603
00:25:49,546 --> 00:25:51,766 A:middle
either using public
or private databases.

604
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:54,036 A:middle
Thank you very much.

605
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:54,976 A:middle
Thank you for your attention.

606
00:25:55,516 --> 00:25:58,500 A:middle
[Applause]
