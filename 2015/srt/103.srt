00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:21,186 A:middle
>> Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the 2015 Apple Design Awards

2
00:00:21,936 --> 00:00:26,596 A:middle
and welcome your host for
this evening, John Geleynse.

3
00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:34,596 A:middle
[ Applause ]

4
00:00:35,096 --> 00:00:35,696 A:middle
>> JOHN GELEYNSE:
Well, good evening.

5
00:00:35,696 --> 00:00:37,296 A:middle
It is -- or good afternoon.

6
00:00:37,296 --> 00:00:38,546 A:middle
It's still afternoon, actually.

7
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:40,226 A:middle
It is great to be here.

8
00:00:40,226 --> 00:00:44,126 A:middle
It's a great moment
to end off this day.

9
00:00:44,126 --> 00:00:46,506 A:middle
I know it's been long, many of
you have been waiting in lines

10
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:47,746 A:middle
around the building to get

11
00:00:47,746 --> 00:00:50,446 A:middle
into the Keynote,
and that was a blast.

12
00:00:50,796 --> 00:00:52,476 A:middle
The Keynote was a blast, too.

13
00:00:53,016 --> 00:00:55,706 A:middle
And then you came into
-- you got your lunch,

14
00:00:55,706 --> 00:00:59,236 A:middle
then you had State of the Union,
and that was a great session.

15
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:03,526 A:middle
And now we want to finish
the day by taking a moment

16

17
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

18
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:03,526 A:middle
And now we want to finish
the day by taking a moment

19
00:01:03,526 --> 00:01:05,646 A:middle
to celebrate the work that some

20
00:01:05,646 --> 00:01:07,536 A:middle
of you have done that's
been extraordinary.

21
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:10,426 A:middle
Many of you do -- all of
you do extraordinary work,

22
00:01:10,466 --> 00:01:13,376 A:middle
but there are some that
stand out from the rest,

23
00:01:13,376 --> 00:01:15,296 A:middle
and we want to take
a few moments

24
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:17,996 A:middle
to just celebrate some
excellence in software design.

25
00:01:18,656 --> 00:01:22,956 A:middle
Now, to begin this
evening and this ceremony,

26
00:01:22,956 --> 00:01:26,806 A:middle
I want to just kick off with a
video, which is a retrospective

27
00:01:26,806 --> 00:01:29,426 A:middle
of the winners from
the last 14 years.

28

29
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

30
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:26,536 A:middle
You know, time flies;
doesn't it?

31
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:30,826 A:middle
How many of you are familiar
with so many of those apps?

32
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,456 A:middle
You played with those games.

33
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:34,896 A:middle
You played with those
productivity tools,

34
00:03:34,896 --> 00:03:36,636 A:middle
some of those design tools.

35
00:03:37,006 --> 00:03:38,416 A:middle
And I had to demo
every one of them

36
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,446 A:middle
on this stage over the years.

37
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:44,336 A:middle
And this is just some
of those that came --

38
00:03:44,336 --> 00:03:47,146 A:middle
that you saw a moment ago coming
through for the last 14 years.

39
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:51,186 A:middle
Those 14 years represent
14 years of Design Awards

40
00:03:51,186 --> 00:03:55,346 A:middle
since OS X was announced,
Mac OS X entered the stage,

41
00:03:55,546 --> 00:03:58,276 A:middle
and we had developers creating
apps right from day one.

42
00:03:58,776 --> 00:04:00,796 A:middle
And then, of course, the
App Store came and iOS

43

44
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

45
00:03:58,776 --> 00:04:00,796 A:middle
And then, of course, the
App Store came and iOS

46
00:04:00,796 --> 00:04:02,526 A:middle
and everything that
we've known since then.

47
00:04:02,996 --> 00:04:05,656 A:middle
So many of you might be familiar
with the most recent ones

48
00:04:05,656 --> 00:04:09,076 A:middle
that were shown, and if you
just take a look at this list --

49
00:04:09,076 --> 00:04:12,276 A:middle
and this isn't to pick off
the best of the 14 years --

50
00:04:12,276 --> 00:04:14,296 A:middle
but these are some notable
ones that I just wanted

51
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,216 A:middle
to highlight for a minute.

52
00:04:16,646 --> 00:04:20,396 A:middle
You know, Starry Night Backyard,
I remember showing that off.

53
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:24,476 A:middle
That was incredible in the
first days of Mac OS X.

54
00:04:24,476 --> 00:04:28,576 A:middle
Macnification, this
great app for science.

55
00:04:28,576 --> 00:04:32,336 A:middle
Delicious Library 2, this
whole genre of apps that came

56
00:04:32,336 --> 00:04:35,606 A:middle
out in the early days of Mac OS
X that redefined the experience

57
00:04:35,606 --> 00:04:39,236 A:middle
for so many of us and actually
forced -- well, not forced --

58
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:40,996 A:middle
but got people excited

59
00:04:40,996 --> 00:04:43,796 A:middle
to purchase a Mac just
to use those apps.

60
00:04:43,846 --> 00:04:45,666 A:middle
MLB.com At Bat.

61
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,216 A:middle
Flight Control.

62
00:04:47,216 --> 00:04:49,326 A:middle
Who didn't play Flight
Control in the first days

63
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:51,536 A:middle
of the App Store, right?

64
00:04:51,536 --> 00:04:54,946 A:middle
Paper for scientific research,
and then Monument Valley,

65
00:04:55,256 --> 00:04:58,346 A:middle
Infinity Blade, incredible apps.

66
00:04:58,956 --> 00:05:05,686 A:middle
What's interesting is that
these apps have set the standard

67

68
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

69
00:04:58,956 --> 00:05:05,686 A:middle
What's interesting is that
these apps have set the standard

70
00:05:05,686 --> 00:05:07,616 A:middle
for so many things; right?

71
00:05:07,956 --> 00:05:09,976 A:middle
They've set the standard
for the user experience

72
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,176 A:middle
that we expect on
these platforms.

73
00:05:12,596 --> 00:05:17,046 A:middle
These folks were pioneers in
many ways, not just these apps,

74
00:05:17,046 --> 00:05:20,056 A:middle
but the apps that showed up
across the last 14 years.

75
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:23,766 A:middle
And I think the -- what's really
cool way to think about it is

76
00:05:23,766 --> 00:05:27,686 A:middle
that in so many ways, each of
the winners each year stood

77
00:05:27,946 --> 00:05:31,196 A:middle
on the shoulders of the
winners from the previous year.

78
00:05:31,936 --> 00:05:34,646 A:middle
Because so many of these
apps defined a new standard,

79
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,616 A:middle
a benchmark in performance
or in usability,

80
00:05:37,986 --> 00:05:40,926 A:middle
and they inspired the rest of
you, inspired so many people

81
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:43,096 A:middle
to go off and create
the next great thing.

82
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:49,406 A:middle
Now, these apps every
year we've judged the apps

83
00:05:49,406 --> 00:05:51,486 A:middle
with the same set of
criteria, basically.

84
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,846 A:middle
We've looked at delightful apps.

85
00:05:53,906 --> 00:05:55,796 A:middle
These are apps that
invite people to play

86
00:05:55,796 --> 00:05:58,066 A:middle
or get real things done; right?

87
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,986 A:middle
They are satisfying;
they are rewarding.

88

89
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

90
00:06:00,956 --> 00:06:02,876 A:middle
We've always looked
for innovative apps,

91
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:07,686 A:middle
winners that have this spark
of brilliance that it's hard

92
00:06:07,686 --> 00:06:10,606 A:middle
to define, but you know
it when you see it.

93
00:06:11,156 --> 00:06:13,606 A:middle
There's state-of-the-art
apps that are modern.

94
00:06:13,726 --> 00:06:15,776 A:middle
They are platform
differentiating.

95
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:20,426 A:middle
They're high performance; they
have high-end capabilities,

96
00:06:20,426 --> 00:06:21,786 A:middle
and they are superprecise.

97
00:06:23,326 --> 00:06:25,056 A:middle
We look for apps
that are engaging.

98
00:06:25,576 --> 00:06:28,006 A:middle
Engagement means that
people keep coming back

99
00:06:28,136 --> 00:06:29,126 A:middle
to use these apps.

100
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:30,886 A:middle
Some of the games
that were shown,

101
00:06:30,886 --> 00:06:32,586 A:middle
some of the productivity
tools are things

102
00:06:32,586 --> 00:06:33,776 A:middle
that we can't live without.

103
00:06:34,386 --> 00:06:36,076 A:middle
We can't live without
playing these games,

104
00:06:36,076 --> 00:06:37,906 A:middle
and we keep coming back
to them again and again.

105
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,126 A:middle
We look for apps
that are enabling.

106
00:06:41,176 --> 00:06:44,426 A:middle
And great Apple Design
Award-winning apps

107
00:06:44,806 --> 00:06:47,186 A:middle
that are enabling
allow you to do things

108
00:06:47,186 --> 00:06:49,926 A:middle
that you could never
do before in new ways.

109
00:06:50,136 --> 00:06:53,096 A:middle
And lastly, we look
for designed apps.

110
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:57,206 A:middle
These are apps that are deeply
considered, that are familiar,

111
00:06:57,596 --> 00:07:00,096 A:middle
they're appealing,
they're attractive,

112

113
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

114
00:06:57,596 --> 00:07:00,096 A:middle
they're appealing,
they're attractive,

115
00:07:00,406 --> 00:07:02,756 A:middle
and they're super intuitive
to use for the people

116
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:03,946 A:middle
that they were created for.

117
00:07:05,016 --> 00:07:07,806 A:middle
So, a quick summary of
how we pick the apps.

118
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:10,386 A:middle
We've always picked them
in basically the same way.

119
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:12,916 A:middle
We've always used essentially
this set of criteria,

120
00:07:13,556 --> 00:07:16,786 A:middle
and this is the criteria
that we used for this year

121
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,356 A:middle
to pick tonight's winners.

122
00:07:19,676 --> 00:07:23,016 A:middle
I'd like to invite my
colleague, Shaan Pruden,

123
00:07:23,086 --> 00:07:26,456 A:middle
on stage to award
tonight's winners.

124
00:07:27,516 --> 00:07:35,016 A:middle
[ Applause ]

125
00:07:35,516 --> 00:07:35,976 A:middle
>> SHAAN PRUDEN: Hello.

126
00:07:36,746 --> 00:07:39,656 A:middle
This year we will be honoring
ten apps from categories

127
00:07:39,656 --> 00:07:42,936 A:middle
across the App Store, but first
we wanted to take a moment

128
00:07:43,186 --> 00:07:45,976 A:middle
and honor two students among
our scholarship winners.

129
00:07:46,556 --> 00:07:49,816 A:middle
>> JOHN GELEYNSE: Now,
the students we are

130
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:53,246 A:middle
about to award are scholarship
winners for this year,

131
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,476 A:middle
but in the process of looking
at the scholarship apps,

132
00:07:57,006 --> 00:07:58,996 A:middle
we discovered some apps
that they, themselves,

133
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:00,716 A:middle
had also written
for the App Store,

134

135
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

136
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:00,716 A:middle
had also written
for the App Store,

137
00:08:01,206 --> 00:08:03,316 A:middle
and we were pretty impressed
with some of these apps

138
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:05,476 A:middle
that were on the App Store
by these scholarship winners.

139
00:08:05,476 --> 00:08:08,166 A:middle
So the two awards
tonight are going to go

140
00:08:08,236 --> 00:08:10,046 A:middle
to developer scholarship winners

141
00:08:10,086 --> 00:08:11,186 A:middle
who have an app on
the App Store.

142
00:08:11,686 --> 00:08:14,666 A:middle
>> SHAAN PRUDEN: And our first
student winner is Elementary

143
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,086 A:middle
Minute by Klemens Strasser.

144
00:08:16,316 --> 00:08:24,066 A:middle
>> The idea for the
app came to Klemens

145
00:08:24,306 --> 00:08:30,326 A:middle
in April 2014 while
sitting in his room thinking

146
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:32,446 A:middle
about the possibility of
having a quiz on his wrist.

147
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:34,356 A:middle
Since there wasn't
an Apple Watch yet,

148
00:08:34,696 --> 00:08:36,956 A:middle
Klemens developed
it for the iPhone.

149

[ Applause ]

150
00:08:50,116 --> 00:08:50,896 A:middle
>> SHAAN PRUDEN:
Congratulations.

151
00:08:51,676 --> 00:08:54,096 A:middle
Here you go.

152
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:56,726 A:middle
Elementary Minute is a
fast-paced trivia game

153
00:08:56,776 --> 00:08:59,006 A:middle
where you are presenting
with statements on topics

154
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:01,526 A:middle
that include math,
geography, and famous people.

157
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:01,526 A:middle
that include math,
geography, and famous people.

158
00:09:02,006 --> 00:09:03,536 A:middle
Quickly swipe up
or down to decide

159
00:09:03,536 --> 00:09:05,166 A:middle
if the statements
are true or false.

160
00:09:05,506 --> 00:09:06,876 A:middle
This app was created by Klemens,

161
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:08,086 A:middle
who is a computer
science student

162
00:09:08,086 --> 00:09:10,156 A:middle
at Technical University
in Graz, Austria.

[ Applause ]

164
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:17,696 A:middle
>> JOHN GELEYNSE:
Austria, right.

165
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:19,656 A:middle
Big cheer down in front here.

166
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:22,696 A:middle
We Picked Elementary Minute as
a student Design Award winner

167
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:26,796 A:middle
because we loved the design, it
was super simple, and it was one

168
00:09:26,796 --> 00:09:30,416 A:middle
of the first games that
came out for Apple Watch.

169
00:09:30,986 --> 00:09:34,326 A:middle
It's built, obviously, on UIKit
and those sorts of technologies.

170
00:09:34,326 --> 00:09:35,746 A:middle
It's integrated with
Game Center,

and it has a clever
two-game mode.

172
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,906 A:middle
You can do a quick five-second
quiz, trivia quiz on your wrist,

173
00:09:41,906 --> 00:09:42,946 A:middle
which is perfect for the Watch,

174
00:09:43,446 --> 00:09:46,016 A:middle
and you can do a one-minute
quiz both on Apple Watch

175
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:48,356 A:middle
and on iPhone, and
we just thought

176
00:09:48,356 --> 00:09:51,846 A:middle
that the way this was done
was really well executed,

177
00:09:51,846 --> 00:09:52,926 A:middle

is a two-person game development

185
00:10:15,776 --> 00:10:16,926 A:middle
team located in Brazil.

186
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:21,076 A:middle
In 2012, Victor took a
game development course,

187
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:23,276 A:middle
and a year later,
he convinced Gabriel

188
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,286 A:middle
to attend the same course.

189
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:28,416 A:middle
One day while discussing what it
was like when they were bullied

190
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,346 A:middle
as kids, they decided
to create a game

191
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:31,846 A:middle
that reflected their experience.

192
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:40,666 A:middle
>> SHAAN PRUDEN:
Congratulations.

193
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:46,836 A:middle
Jump-O is a minimalist game

194
00:10:46,836 --> 00:10:48,346 A:middle
where you play Roundy
the circle,

195
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:51,106 A:middle
overcoming the dangers presented
by the squareish world.

196
00:10:51,686 --> 00:10:54,296 A:middle
It was created by two
university students from Brazil

197
00:10:54,296 --> 00:10:56,206 A:middle
and features beautiful
hand-drawn puzzles.

198

know what's really fun

199
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:01,586 A:middle
for us actually at Apple
is these folks took some

202
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:01,586 A:middle
for us actually at Apple
is these folks took some

203
00:11:01,586 --> 00:11:03,976 A:middle
of the iOS training
courses that are in Brazil

204
00:11:03,976 --> 00:11:07,196 A:middle
and gained some experience
there to build this game.

205
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,326 A:middle
We picked jump-O as a
student Design Award winner

206
00:11:10,326 --> 00:11:14,066 A:middle
because of its unique minimalist
design, as Shaan mentioned.

207
00:11:14,396 --> 00:11:16,936 A:middle
It's built on Game
Center, it uses Sprite Kit

208
00:11:16,936 --> 00:11:19,586 A:middle
for scene management
and game physics.

209
00:11:19,976 --> 00:11:21,886 A:middle
The input of the
game is super simple.

210
00:11:21,886 --> 00:11:23,756 A:middle
It's tap and device motion.

211
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:28,206 A:middle
And it's got great
responsiveness, 68 worlds,

212
00:11:28,206 --> 00:11:31,486 A:middle
48 levels, just a
really fun game

213
00:11:31,696 --> 00:11:34,326 A:middle
that we thought was just
really, really well done,

214
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,536 A:middle
and one of those games
that seems easy to learn

215
00:11:36,856 --> 00:11:39,706 A:middle
but it's hard to
master in that genre.

216
00:11:39,706 --> 00:11:41,936 A:middle
So congratulations,
great work, guys.

Our first winner is an
imagination-stirring puzzle.

224
00:12:05,616 --> 00:12:08,976 A:middle
It is Shadowmatic by
Triada Studio Games.

225
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:18,206 A:middle
>> Triada Studio was
established in Armenia in 1993

226
00:12:18,576 --> 00:12:20,366 A:middle
as a computer graphics
and animation studio,

227
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:23,546 A:middle
and they successfully work on
TV commercials, visual effects

228
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:26,116 A:middle
for movies, and various
other animation projects.

229
00:12:26,196 --> 00:12:28,856 A:middle
In 2007, they thought about
branching into video games,

230
00:12:28,906 --> 00:12:30,506 A:middle
began building a game engine.

231
00:12:30,566 --> 00:12:32,526 A:middle
The four-person game
team started work

232
00:12:32,526 --> 00:12:36,966 A:middle
on Shadowmatic in March 2012.

233
00:12:38,876 --> 00:12:40,666 A:middle
>> SHAAN PRUDEN:
Shadowmatic is a unique twist

I don't want to stand
in their way.

236
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:47,236 A:middle
Rotate abstract objects
in a spotlight

237
00:12:47,576 --> 00:12:50,496 A:middle
to find recognizable silhouettes
in the projected shadow

238
00:12:50,496 --> 00:12:52,646 A:middle
that are relevant to the
surrounding environment.

239
00:12:56,056 --> 00:12:56,616 A:middle
>> JOHN GELEYNSE: All right.

240
00:12:56,616 --> 00:12:58,556 A:middle
So we picked Shadowmatic
as a winner

since it's ornately crafted
-- bit of feedback --

245
00:13:03,876 --> 00:13:06,666 A:middle
super imaginative, and
really well executed.

246
00:13:06,796 --> 00:13:09,356 A:middle
And I'd like to show
this to you now.

247
00:13:10,186 --> 00:13:12,446 A:middle
So let's get into the
level -- let's turn it off.

248
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:15,216 A:middle
Let's get into the main menu.

249
00:13:15,286 --> 00:13:18,866 A:middle
So what you see here is just
there's device motion that's

250
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:22,456 A:middle
affecting the view
into this main menu.

251
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,936 A:middle
I can interact with objects,
which is no big deal,

252
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:26,256 A:middle
but I am just showing
you the attention

253
00:13:26,256 --> 00:13:28,616 A:middle
to detail that's
even at this level.

254
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:31,326 A:middle
And straightaway you hear
this ambient sound track,

255
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:34,516 A:middle
and it's a beautiful sound
track throughout the game,

256
00:13:34,516 --> 00:13:37,056 A:middle
and it's available for
purchase on iTunes even.

257
00:13:37,676 --> 00:13:40,816 A:middle
So let me just go into
this second level here

258
00:13:41,556 --> 00:13:42,796 A:middle
and show you how this works.

259
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:44,866 A:middle
If you play the game,
you already know.

260
00:13:45,106 --> 00:13:47,396 A:middle
If you've not played the game,
this is a good level to start

261
00:13:47,396 --> 00:13:49,106 A:middle
at to show you how it all works.

262
00:13:49,706 --> 00:13:51,506 A:middle
So basically what we
are doing is taking one

263
00:13:51,506 --> 00:13:54,496 A:middle
of these objects here, which is
represented at various levels

264
00:13:54,496 --> 00:13:56,926 A:middle
with ceramics and metal
and wood and all kinds

265
00:13:56,926 --> 00:13:58,746 A:middle
of different materials that
are beautifully rendered

266
00:13:58,746 --> 00:14:02,836 A:middle
in the scene, and you take one
finger to rotate it around,

267

268
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

269
00:13:58,746 --> 00:14:02,836 A:middle
in the scene, and you take one
finger to rotate it around,

270
00:14:02,836 --> 00:14:04,696 A:middle
and you take two
fingers to twist it.

271
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:08,176 A:middle
And essentially, what you are
trying to do is figure out what,

272
00:14:08,256 --> 00:14:09,446 A:middle
you know, shadow it is

273
00:14:09,856 --> 00:14:11,546 A:middle
that you're trying
to build on the wall.

274
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:13,416 A:middle
So I am going to
rotate it slightly,

275
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,496 A:middle
looks like I am getting
some kind of a handle there.

276
00:14:16,206 --> 00:14:21,536 A:middle
And you'll notice on the bottom
of the screen there's some dots

277
00:14:21,536 --> 00:14:25,326 A:middle
that may light up here soon
if I get close to what it is

278
00:14:25,326 --> 00:14:28,146 A:middle
that I'm -- yeah, as
soon as I get close

279
00:14:28,226 --> 00:14:30,796 A:middle
to the puzzle I am trying to
solve, I get this feedback

280
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:32,296 A:middle
on these glowing
dots at the bottom.

281
00:14:32,736 --> 00:14:35,186 A:middle
And so now I think I am pretty
close to something that looks

282
00:14:35,186 --> 00:14:39,186 A:middle
like a teapot, so there we go.

283
00:14:39,326 --> 00:14:42,056 A:middle
I get the six dots, and I
figured out this puzzle.

284
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:45,506 A:middle
And every level is like this,
and obviously, you're timed.

285
00:14:45,696 --> 00:14:47,056 A:middle
As you go up through the levels,

286
00:14:47,056 --> 00:14:48,506 A:middle
it gets more and
more complicated.

287
00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:52,616 A:middle
We love the parallax effect
that looks like you are looking

288
00:14:52,706 --> 00:14:54,436 A:middle
into a window in the scene.

289
00:14:54,736 --> 00:14:58,416 A:middle

I want to show this to you now.

321
00:16:32,346 --> 00:16:37,066 A:middle
So pick the first letter.

322
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:40,116 A:middle
Right from the start you
see this torn fabric effect,

323
00:16:40,206 --> 00:16:41,756 A:middle
which is the beginning
of the animations.

324
00:16:42,246 --> 00:16:45,186 A:middle
I tap on these letters,
and they start to interact.

325
00:16:45,186 --> 00:16:48,746 A:middle
I am simply tapping, pinching,
zooming, whatever I want to do,

326
00:16:48,846 --> 00:16:51,116 A:middle
whatever the child would want
to do, whatever the student

327
00:16:51,116 --> 00:16:55,716 A:middle
of letters would want to do, and
you get these scenes that reveal

328
00:16:55,716 --> 00:16:56,976 A:middle
as you interact with
the letters.

329
00:16:57,466 --> 00:17:00,866 A:middle

the A and move upwards,

So as I start to stroke
the A and move upwards,

333
00:17:01,636 --> 00:17:05,026 A:middle
I now get the word Arch, and
the narrator would tell me

334
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:05,715 A:middle
that word.

335
00:17:05,715 --> 00:17:07,556 A:middle
It begins with A.

336
00:17:07,556 --> 00:17:10,386 A:middle
As I play with the scene,
suddenly it starts to move.

337
00:17:10,826 --> 00:17:14,086 A:middle
I get this effect of ambling.

338
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:16,945 A:middle
So you can continue to
play with these letters,

00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:18,356 A:middle
and you learn more
and more words

340
00:17:18,356 --> 00:17:19,415 A:middle
that begin with that letter.

341
00:17:19,886 --> 00:17:22,465 A:middle
And kids, students, you
know, learning English

342
00:17:22,465 --> 00:17:23,826 A:middle
as a second language, whatever,

343
00:17:24,106 --> 00:17:27,236 A:middle
are going to learn these
characters and want

344
00:17:27,236 --> 00:17:28,506 A:middle
to keep coming back
to this game.

345
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:31,346 A:middle
Let me just show you the G.

346
00:17:31,956 --> 00:17:34,276 A:middle
My last name starts with
G, I like the letter.

347
00:17:34,656 --> 00:17:35,326 A:middle
Let's go in.

348
00:17:35,326 --> 00:17:37,866 A:middle
We tap on it a few times,
it goes three-dimensional.

349
00:17:38,286 --> 00:17:40,316 A:middle
I pinch on it, it
becomes a guitar.

350
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,856 A:middle
You can look at the
attention to detail here

351
00:17:43,406 --> 00:17:49,026 A:middle
because I can play individual
strings, but if I start

352
00:17:49,076 --> 00:17:54,066 A:middle
to strum the guitar, a
garden begins to grow.

353
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:55,886 A:middle
Kids just love this
stuff, right?

354
00:17:55,886 --> 00:17:58,076 A:middle
It's just surprising,
unexpected,

355
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:01,846 A:middle
and I can pick these flowers,
and they turn into ghosts,

and I can pick these flowers,
and they turn into ghosts,

359
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:05,786 A:middle
which again begins
with the letter G.

360
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:09,936 A:middle
And that's just an example
of the nature of this app,

361
00:18:09,936 --> 00:18:14,296 A:middle
which is just this bright,
cheerful app with super-great --

began almost a decade ago

370
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:48,976 A:middle
at Stanford University,

371
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,326 A:middle
where cofounders were
roommates and classmates.

To inspire a new
generation of investors,

373
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:57,856 A:middle
they built a brokerage from
the ground up, allowing them

374
00:18:57,856 --> 00:18:59,286 A:middle
to eliminate commissions
altogether.

Robinhood lets you buy

>> JOHN GELEYNSE: All right.

390
00:19:33,896 --> 00:19:34,506 A:middle
Let's take a look.

391
00:19:35,056 --> 00:19:37,646 A:middle
So Robinhood distinguishes
itself with this clean,

392
00:19:37,696 --> 00:19:40,576 A:middle
content-centric design,
beautiful typography,

393
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,696 A:middle
and a design that
really does a good job

394
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:46,756 A:middle
at balancing app branding
with iOS design conventions.

395
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:52,436 A:middle
So right out of the gate,
the app just draws you in.

396
00:19:52,436 --> 00:19:55,596 A:middle
The goal of the app is to
get more people to invest,

397
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:59,446 A:middle
and right away, they decide
that there's no need to sign

398
00:19:59,446 --> 00:20:02,656 A:middle
up to actually do
things in the app.

up to actually do
things in the app.

402
00:20:03,186 --> 00:20:04,016 A:middle
Let's see here.

403
00:20:04,566 --> 00:20:06,906 A:middle
Let me go to my backup.

404
00:20:16,436 --> 00:20:17,096 A:middle
There we go.

405
00:20:17,636 --> 00:20:20,786 A:middle
Because on the main screen,
if we simply scroll up,

406
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,336 A:middle
we get a bunch of stock
symbols, and these are

407
00:20:23,336 --> 00:20:25,486 A:middle
because the app is using
geolocation to come

408
00:20:25,486 --> 00:20:28,896 A:middle
up with these symbols based
on companies that are nearby.

409
00:20:29,446 --> 00:20:32,756 A:middle
So let's just tap into
Apple, and you can look

410
00:20:32,756 --> 00:20:35,576 A:middle
at Apple's performance
over the last little while.

411
00:20:35,576 --> 00:20:38,826 A:middle
You can tap on this chart and
see the stock performance.

412
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:40,226 A:middle
I am not logged in yet.

413
00:20:40,226 --> 00:20:42,006 A:middle
I am not a customer of theirs.

414
00:20:42,006 --> 00:20:43,036 A:middle
I am not a member.

415
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:44,416 A:middle
I am not -- you know, I
haven't done anything here.

416
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,766 A:middle
I am just playing around with
this app, exploring with it.

417
00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:50,596 A:middle
I can just tap and drag on the
chart, get some great feedback

418
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:51,766 A:middle
on the values at the top.

419
00:20:52,156 --> 00:20:55,356 A:middle
I can pinch and get a range
and get an average value.

420
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:56,746 A:middle
So that's pretty cool.

421
00:20:56,926 --> 00:20:58,706 A:middle
I can look at stats
from the company.

422
00:20:59,116 --> 00:21:02,716 A:middle
I can swipe, do the
page effect to go back

425
00:20:59,116 --> 00:21:02,716 A:middle
I can swipe, do the
page effect to go back

426
00:21:02,806 --> 00:21:03,746 A:middle
to a different symbol.

427
00:21:04,236 --> 00:21:05,976 A:middle
Here I am at SPY; right?

428
00:21:06,246 --> 00:21:07,706 A:middle
I am looking through
all of this.

429
00:21:09,116 --> 00:21:10,556 A:middle
Right? So I can explore
all of these.

430
00:21:11,296 --> 00:21:12,496 A:middle
Let's go back to Apple.

431
00:21:12,496 --> 00:21:15,356 A:middle
And let's say that at this
point we are like yeah,

432
00:21:15,686 --> 00:21:18,186 A:middle
wonder what it would be like
to buy a stock in this app.

433
00:21:18,646 --> 00:21:21,856 A:middle
So we tap Buy, we decide
let's buy 25 shares

434
00:21:22,146 --> 00:21:25,966 A:middle
at the current market price
for a total of $3,195.

435
00:21:25,966 --> 00:21:26,906 A:middle
We say that's fine.

436
00:21:27,016 --> 00:21:31,306 A:middle
Review. Robinhood tells us
that this is a simulated trade,

437
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:32,846 A:middle
but if we were doing a trade,

438
00:21:32,846 --> 00:21:34,306 A:middle
we could just swipe
up from the bottom.

439
00:21:34,796 --> 00:21:37,116 A:middle
The device vibrates,
I get some feedback,

440
00:21:37,366 --> 00:21:38,936 A:middle
and it says that's
what it would be

441
00:21:38,936 --> 00:21:41,286 A:middle
like to purchase some
stock in this application.

442
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:44,666 A:middle
And at this point, I can
decide this is pretty cool

443
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,306 A:middle
and I am going to sign
up and you quickly put

444
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,776 A:middle
in some basic information
about yourself,

445
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:51,936 A:middle
you decide how you are going
to fund your transactions,

446
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:53,896 A:middle
whether it's a checking
account, savings account,

447
00:21:54,316 --> 00:21:57,106 A:middle
and then you move on from
there and start investing.

448
00:21:57,536 --> 00:22:02,506 A:middle

very many of the

This is a full-featured

One of the cool things
that they've got in the --

486
00:23:33,086 --> 00:23:36,026 A:middle
just to get you oriented
is in the top-left corner

487
00:23:36,026 --> 00:23:37,866 A:middle
of the screen, there
are three icons,

488

and these represent
their personas,

00:23:40,296 --> 00:23:41,726 A:middle
basically modes for the app.

490
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:43,616 A:middle
So here we have the
draw persona,

491
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:46,606 A:middle
which gives us the tools
we need for vector drawing.

492
00:23:47,006 --> 00:23:49,806 A:middle
We can shift to the pixel
persona, which is the tools

493
00:23:49,806 --> 00:23:51,056 A:middle
for pixel-based editing.

494
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,786 A:middle
Then we can move to the export
persona, which allows us

495
00:23:53,786 --> 00:23:56,326 A:middle
to export layers, groups,
objects, and regions.

496
00:23:56,896 --> 00:23:58,906 A:middle
Right? Let's go back
to the draw persona.

00:24:23,536 --> 00:24:25,496 A:middle
As I scroll around at something

508
00:24:25,496 --> 00:24:28,326 A:middle
like 5,000 percent right
now, it's very quick.

509
00:24:28,906 --> 00:24:31,266 A:middle
They've got a great
feature where I can go

510
00:24:31,266 --> 00:24:32,486 A:middle
into these split views.

511
00:24:33,476 --> 00:24:34,246 A:middle
Just a second here.

512
00:24:35,096 --> 00:24:42,976 A:middle
Let's go into view mode
and go into split view,

513
00:24:43,256 --> 00:24:45,926 A:middle
which lets me split the
screen into two views,

514
00:24:45,926 --> 00:24:49,596 A:middle
and one of these views I can
actually go into outline view,

515
00:24:49,596 --> 00:24:52,596 A:middle
which means that in real-time,
I am getting my object --

516
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,266 A:middle
I can see the full
rendered version or I can go

517
00:24:55,266 --> 00:24:59,976 A:middle
into outline view and select
individual objects [applause].

520
00:25:01,046 --> 00:25:03,516 A:middle
So then I can select them,
rotate them, grow them,

521
00:25:03,816 --> 00:25:07,136 A:middle
whatever I need to do,
and all of this is live.

522
00:25:07,196 --> 00:25:12,516 A:middle
So I could pick this object here
and grow it into this portion

523
00:25:12,516 --> 00:25:14,796 A:middle
of the screen, and you would see
the rendering effect right live

524
00:25:15,196 --> 00:25:17,196 A:middle
across the divide.

525
00:25:17,196 --> 00:25:19,106 A:middle
And I can just move this

526
00:25:19,106 --> 00:25:21,116 A:middle
in real-time back
and forth super fast.

527
00:25:21,696 --> 00:25:26,456 A:middle
Now, I was talking about
how you could do zoom,

528
00:25:26,646 --> 00:25:30,666 A:middle
and I remember seeing that there
was a spelling error up here,

529
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:32,496 A:middle
so I am just going
to zoom in here

530
00:25:32,496 --> 00:25:34,366 A:middle
and fix something on my design.

531
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,366 A:middle
Now I am in at about
10,000 percent.

532
00:25:36,406 --> 00:25:41,726 A:middle
And I am just going to
change this one edit here,

533
00:25:42,146 --> 00:25:43,916 A:middle
and you know, move back out.

534
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:46,666 A:middle
And you are looking
at this image here.

535
00:25:47,326 --> 00:25:50,606 A:middle
Right? So there's a
ton I could show you.

536
00:25:50,606 --> 00:25:52,416 A:middle
They've got a great corner tool,

537
00:25:52,686 --> 00:25:56,056 A:middle
they've got tremendous

568
00:27:27,496 --> 00:27:29,436 A:middle
you know, it's got
this addictive balance

569
00:27:29,516 --> 00:27:33,936 A:middle
between a casual puzzle and
arcade game and, you know,

570
00:27:33,936 --> 00:27:36,326 A:middle
if you haven't played this game
you are missing out big time,

571
00:27:36,386 --> 00:27:39,086 A:middle
but if you have, you know
exactly what this is all about;

572
00:27:39,086 --> 00:27:39,246 A:middle
right?

573
00:27:39,246 --> 00:27:41,546 A:middle
You are this chicken
or some crazy character

574
00:27:41,546 --> 00:27:44,806 A:middle
that they've drawn, and you are
crossing these multilane roads.

575
00:27:45,286 --> 00:27:46,926 A:middle
Now, in this particular
case, I am not the chicken,

but let's move anyway.

Okay. I am sorry.

see if the chicken comes
up, love the chicken.

589
00:28:15,886 --> 00:28:18,146 A:middle
So you have all these
characters that they've created,

590
00:28:18,146 --> 00:28:19,646 A:middle
and there's some
really good stuff.

Here's the dress,
you know, #thedress.

Let's go back to one
of my favorite ones.

594
00:28:29,426 --> 00:28:33,106 A:middle
I actually own chickens, just
the funniest creatures around,

595
00:28:33,556 --> 00:28:35,986 A:middle
so this is a real fun game
to play with your chicken.

596
00:28:36,826 --> 00:28:43,806 A:middle
So if you just look at the
8-bit isometric graphics,

597
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:48,556 A:middle
just the sound.

598
00:28:48,556 --> 00:28:52,146 A:middle
Oh, and if that happens,
I can actually share this

599
00:28:52,226 --> 00:28:55,646 A:middle

look at the effect.

you could play this
forever; right?

00:29:05,226 --> 00:29:07,786 A:middle
And I know people who
get all the way up to 700

the highest I can get is

612

about the way you've designed
your characters, the artwork.

613

expressive characters,

excellent sound design,
and you know what?

I think all of that combines to
create really great personality.

This game has got
tremendous personality,

a great characteristic

couple of features in this app

00:31:11,206 --> 00:31:13,356 A:middle
that we think make
it really great.

655
00:31:13,756 --> 00:31:15,346 A:middle
First of all, it's super fast.

656
00:31:15,976 --> 00:31:18,066 A:middle
So if you just go to the
left side of the screen here,

657
00:31:18,296 --> 00:31:21,116 A:middle
you scroll through all
your stuff, the entire --

658
00:31:21,406 --> 00:31:22,906 A:middle
you know, everything
just follows along.

659
00:31:22,906 --> 00:31:25,566 A:middle
You look at the top-left corner,
it's whipping across the weeks

660
00:31:25,616 --> 00:31:27,106 A:middle
to indicate the ones
that are selected.

661
00:31:27,396 --> 00:31:30,006 A:middle
The right side is moving
through your full calendar.

662
00:31:30,006 --> 00:31:33,086 A:middle
And there's just not a
hesitation to the app.

663
00:31:33,306 --> 00:31:34,956 A:middle
That's fantastic.

664
00:31:35,386 --> 00:31:38,006 A:middle
We can examine what's
going on on a specific day.

665
00:31:38,006 --> 00:31:39,836 A:middle
If you look at the
top-left corner here,

666

you have dots below
some of these dates.

667
00:31:41,576 --> 00:31:44,086 A:middle
If I point on the
dates with dots,

668
00:31:44,446 --> 00:31:46,646 A:middle
and the dots are colored
according to my calendar colors,

669
00:31:46,976 --> 00:31:48,296 A:middle
I can see exactly what's going

670
00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:50,326 A:middle
on on those days
from which calendars.

671
00:31:50,636 --> 00:31:51,406 A:middle
That's pretty cool.

672
00:31:51,406 --> 00:31:53,576 A:middle
I don't have to collect and
examine and go into that day

673

and look at what's
happening at that point.

Fantastical 2 makes it super
easy to add new things,

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

677
00:31:57,106 --> 00:32:00,636 A:middle
Fantastical 2 makes it super
easy to add new things,

678
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:02,566 A:middle
new events or new reminders.

679
00:32:03,026 --> 00:32:04,676 A:middle
They support both
reminders and events.

680
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:08,176 A:middle
So the way to add something
new is if you are in the app,

681
00:32:08,216 --> 00:32:11,966 A:middle
you tap this Add button, and now
you can use just simple English

682
00:32:12,016 --> 00:32:15,316 A:middle
language sentences, and they
have a natural language parser

683
00:32:15,596 --> 00:32:19,076 A:middle
that will just interpret
these and translate, you know,

684
00:32:19,076 --> 00:32:21,546 A:middle
and interpret those into
the actual event details.

685
00:32:21,756 --> 00:32:24,696 A:middle
And as I type, I want you
to watch the extra attention

686
00:32:24,696 --> 00:32:26,826 A:middle
to detail where, as it's
parsing, what I am doing,

687
00:32:26,826 --> 00:32:29,406 A:middle
it's going to be throwing
down dates and the times

688
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:34,236 A:middle
into the spots in that field
in the form that appears.

689
00:32:34,696 --> 00:32:40,656 A:middle
So let's just do something
like meet with Ron tomorrow

690
00:32:41,686 --> 00:32:45,016 A:middle
at 6:00 p.m. for 30 minutes.

691
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,006 A:middle
For example.

692
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,106 A:middle
Boom. And there it is.

693
00:32:48,106 --> 00:32:49,376 A:middle
It knows what tomorrow means,

694
00:32:49,376 --> 00:32:51,116 A:middle
it knows what 30
minutes means, etcetera.

695
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:53,726 A:middle
The app is localized
into nine languages,

696
00:32:53,976 --> 00:32:56,146 A:middle
and the natural language
parser works

697
00:32:56,146 --> 00:32:57,626 A:middle
in those nine languages as well.

698
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,656 A:middle
So this is a really great
experience across the world

701
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,656 A:middle
So this is a really great
experience across the world

702
00:33:00,656 --> 00:33:03,976 A:middle
for people in many,
many countries.

703
00:33:04,626 --> 00:33:06,316 A:middle
You can also add events.

704
00:33:06,316 --> 00:33:08,646 A:middle
If you were in another
application, you could just go

705
00:33:08,646 --> 00:33:12,136 A:middle
up to the menu extra and
just add stuff up here,

706
00:33:12,136 --> 00:33:13,636 A:middle
so I could do something else,

707
00:33:13,636 --> 00:33:22,126 A:middle
like pick up sushi next
Tuesday at 7:00 p.m. Boom.

708
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:23,356 A:middle
And it throws the date in there,

709
00:33:23,356 --> 00:33:24,736 A:middle
puts it on my calendar,
and it's gone.

710
00:33:25,016 --> 00:33:27,046 A:middle
This little guy can
be torn off --

711
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,766 A:middle
I wouldn't do this with the main
app running, but for the demo,

712
00:33:29,766 --> 00:33:32,296 A:middle
let me tear this off, and you
can have a Mini Window there

713
00:33:32,506 --> 00:33:35,506 A:middle
that's really handy to have
sticking around onscreen.

714
00:33:36,236 --> 00:33:39,836 A:middle
The other thing that they
do is that they've got --

715
00:33:39,836 --> 00:33:42,126 A:middle
Fantastical has got
multiple calendar sets,

716
00:33:42,566 --> 00:33:46,086 A:middle
and you can create work sets,
home sets, vacation sets,

717
00:33:46,086 --> 00:33:47,736 A:middle
whatever sets of
calendars you want,

718
00:33:47,866 --> 00:33:52,246 A:middle
and these calendars can have
multiple calendars within them,

719
00:33:52,356 --> 00:33:55,716 A:middle
and each set of calendars
can be activated at any time.

720
00:33:55,846 --> 00:33:59,166 A:middle
And not only that, you can go
in and say I want this calendar

721
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:02,116 A:middle
to be activated on my
arrival at this location.

to be activated on my
arrival at this location.

725
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,336 A:middle
So I get to work, boom,
my calendar enables.

726
00:34:04,886 --> 00:34:08,346 A:middle
Or I get home, or I leave home
and some other calendar enables.

727
00:34:08,815 --> 00:34:09,396 A:middle
Very cool.

728
00:34:10,536 --> 00:34:13,406 A:middle
So you can see that here when
you go into Manage Calendars,

729
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:16,186 A:middle
you can go through, pick the
different ones you've got,

730
00:34:16,186 --> 00:34:17,746 A:middle
and you can automatically
activate

731
00:34:17,746 --> 00:34:20,996 A:middle
on a location that
you might want.

732
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:24,266 A:middle
Fantastical does a
great job of toggling

733
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:29,275 A:middle
between these calendars, and it
also supports a Today widget.

734
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:32,815 A:middle
They have Share and
Action extensions.

735
00:34:32,815 --> 00:34:34,606 A:middle
They support geolocation.

736
00:34:34,896 --> 00:34:38,626 A:middle
They are deeply integrated
with OS X Yosemite,

737
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:41,255 A:middle
and I just think it's a
tremendous productivity app.

738
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:44,775 A:middle
You guys have done a fantastic
job and I think set the standard

739
00:34:45,076 --> 00:34:47,416 A:middle

productivity apps should

740
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:47,835 A:middle

767
00:36:02,806 --> 00:36:06,386 A:middle
and just like a moment ago
I said Fantastical set the

768
00:36:06,386 --> 00:36:09,606 A:middle
standard for what productivity
apps on the Mac should be like,

769
00:36:10,176 --> 00:36:13,136 A:middle
Workflow sets the standard
for what accessibility --

770
00:36:13,346 --> 00:36:16,816 A:middle
what apps should be doing in
terms of adopting accessibility,

771
00:36:17,106 --> 00:36:19,966 A:middle
to enable these apps
to be used by people

773
00:36:22,026 --> 00:36:25,266 A:middle
And I could do this
demo, but honestly,

774
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:29,036 A:middle
it's far more impactful if
it is done by a colleague --

Apple is very deeply
committed to accessibility.

We have accessibility in all our
products, including iOS, OS X,

and now even the Watch.

792
00:37:23,876 --> 00:37:26,496 A:middle
But you know, today I want to
talk about VoiceOver in iOS.

793
00:37:27,506 --> 00:37:28,356 A:middle
Now, if you don't know,

794
00:37:28,356 --> 00:37:30,906 A:middle
VoiceOver is a built-in
screen reader

795
00:37:31,336 --> 00:37:33,806 A:middle
that allows visually
impaired users

796
00:37:34,026 --> 00:37:37,086 A:middle
to access iOS and your apps.

797
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:43,476 A:middle
So you may be asking yourself,
well, how do I use VoiceOver?

798
00:37:43,476 --> 00:37:43,846 A:middle
What's that?

799
00:37:44,016 --> 00:37:46,986 A:middle
I mean -- to use
VoiceOver, you really need

800
00:37:46,986 --> 00:37:48,086 A:middle
to know three gestures --

801
00:37:48,706 --> 00:37:52,416 A:middle
touch, swipe, and
double-tap to activate.

802
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:55,226 A:middle
In a moment, I am going to
have Ryan demo those gestures.

803
00:37:55,226 --> 00:37:57,706 A:middle
Let's talk about
touch, touch to explore.

804
00:37:58,386 --> 00:38:01,466 A:middle
It's a way for visually
impaired users

805

806
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

807
00:37:58,386 --> 00:38:01,466 A:middle
It's a way for visually
impaired users

808
00:38:01,466 --> 00:38:06,616 A:middle
to safely navigate your apps in
iOS without activating anything.

809
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:08,936 A:middle
And so they can get
the layout of the app.

810
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:11,746 A:middle
And to demonstrate that,
I am going to ask Ryan

811
00:38:11,746 --> 00:38:13,276 A:middle
to show you touch to explore.

812
00:38:16,236 --> 00:38:17,566 A:middle
>> Game Center.

813
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:19,326 A:middle
Double-tap to open.

>> DEAN HUDSON: The second
gesture we have is swipe

815
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:27,606 A:middle
to navigate, and this allows a
user to swipe through buttons,

816
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:30,966 A:middle

application sequentially,

817
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,776 A:middle

>> DEAN HUDSON: Now, the third
gesture we have is double-tap.

823
00:38:45,806 --> 00:38:47,756 A:middle
Now, remember, with
VoiceOver on,

824
00:38:48,016 --> 00:38:49,546 A:middle
touching is not going
to activate the item.

825
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:52,676 A:middle
You have to use a double-tap.

826
00:38:52,976 --> 00:38:55,026 A:middle
What's interesting about
this gesture, though,

827
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,156 A:middle
is you can have VoiceOver
focused on an element

828
00:38:58,686 --> 00:39:01,746 A:middle
and double-tap anywhere
else on the screen.

And that's very unique.

833
00:39:03,606 --> 00:39:06,996 A:middle
It's very crucial for VoiceOver
users because it's hard to find

really only half the story;

840
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:25,696 A:middle
right?

841
00:39:26,776 --> 00:39:30,056 A:middle
You know, the other half is
what you, as a developer,

842
00:39:30,586 --> 00:39:32,386 A:middle
does in your apps to
make it accessible.

843
00:39:32,896 --> 00:39:35,436 A:middle
And it's using VoiceOver
together with accessibility

844
00:39:35,436 --> 00:39:37,196 A:middle
that makes a great
user experience.

845
00:39:37,686 --> 00:39:40,996 A:middle
Right now I am going to have
Ryan show the Workflow app

846
00:39:40,996 --> 00:39:42,786 A:middle

said, my name is Ryan Dour,

848
00:39:46,056 --> 00:39:46,936 A:middle
and I am going to take you

849
00:39:46,936 --> 00:39:48,546 A:middle
through Workflow
using VoiceOver.

850
00:39:48,876 --> 00:39:52,176 A:middle
First I am going to go ahead
and start creating a Workflow.

it's a visual button,

852
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:56,396 A:middle
for me it's going
to speak a label.

I want to do here, actually,

00:40:13,656 --> 00:40:17,226 A:middle
I would like to get my current
location, then I think I want

866
00:40:17,226 --> 00:40:20,786 A:middle
to turn it into a URL so I
can share it with friends.

Finally, I think I'll copy
to my clipboard, actually,

in a bunch of places.

this accessibility is cra-cra.

This is off the charts
[laughter].

931
00:42:29,486 --> 00:42:31,676 A:middle
It's interesting because
VoiceOver users are

932
00:42:31,866 --> 00:42:32,966 A:middle
like any other users.

933
00:42:32,966 --> 00:42:35,076 A:middle
We go to the store, go
to the same App Store,

934
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:40,286 A:middle
look at the same games,
applications, prices,

935
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:45,166 A:middle
and we purchase and download
and open your app, it's amazing

936
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:46,556 A:middle
when we find it's accessible.

937
00:42:46,686 --> 00:42:50,056 A:middle
It just really makes
things work out well for us.

you are driving these

game is time,

you can just go pick that up.

So we are in Mogadishu here,
and we can turn on the effects.

1178
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:59,796 A:middle
Right on iPhone, we can start
doing some cool effects.

[ Music ]

1182
00:53:07,046 --> 00:53:08,536 A:middle
Okay. I can do a high-low.

1183
00:53:13,046 --> 00:53:14,646 A:middle
I can do an 8-bit.

1184
00:53:18,046 --> 00:53:19,056 A:middle
Right. Let's move
to the next song.

1185
00:53:19,056 --> 00:53:21,446 A:middle
It's going to do this
autopilot mixing.

1186
00:53:21,636 --> 00:53:24,136 A:middle
So you just say move
on to the next song.

1187
00:53:24,136 --> 00:53:25,766 A:middle
It's got this animation
coming in.

1188
00:53:25,986 --> 00:53:28,976 A:middle
It's going to analyze the
beats, and then it's going

1189
00:53:28,976 --> 00:53:31,566 A:middle
to merge these two songs
together really nicely.

1190
00:53:34,126 --> 00:53:41,146 A:middle
Well, I sped that
up a little bit.

1191
00:53:41,316 --> 00:53:45,486 A:middle
Sorry. Right, so you see the
effect that we've got here.

1192
00:53:45,486 --> 00:53:50,826 A:middle
Right? So I can do some
white noise in the app.

1193
00:53:50,826 --> 00:53:53,036 A:middle
Then you've got that
happening on the iPhone.

1194
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:55,406 A:middle
But they actually added
Apple Watch support,

1195
00:53:55,716 --> 00:54:00,386 A:middle
so you can take your iPhone,
stick it in the stereo at home,

1198
00:53:55,716 --> 00:54:00,386 A:middle
so you can take your iPhone,
stick it in the stereo at home,

1199
00:54:00,606 --> 00:54:04,756 A:middle
and now pick up your watch, go
dancing with your friends --

1200
00:54:05,006 --> 00:54:06,776 A:middle
let's switch to the Watch here.

1201
00:54:06,936 --> 00:54:09,256 A:middle
Let's launch Pacemaker
on the Watch.

1202
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:17,056 A:middle
We can add these effects.

1203
00:54:17,846 --> 00:54:20,526 A:middle
And it knows exactly
which track is playing,

1204
00:54:21,096 --> 00:54:22,546 A:middle
and so we can add
some white noise.

1205
00:54:23,116 --> 00:54:25,996 A:middle
We can stop it.

1206
00:54:27,456 --> 00:54:30,606 A:middle
We can add the chop.

1207
00:54:31,406 --> 00:54:34,086 A:middle
And you notice see the feedback
going right on the watch?

1208
00:54:34,496 --> 00:54:37,846 A:middle
It's all timed with the music
that's playing right now.

1209
00:54:39,786 --> 00:54:40,976 A:middle
I can add the 8-bit effect.

1210
00:54:48,046 --> 00:54:49,836 A:middle
I didn't say I was a DJ, but
you know, you get the point.

1211
00:54:50,306 --> 00:54:54,806 A:middle
And I can apply the low filter
effect, and it will dip.

1212
00:54:54,806 --> 00:54:57,976 A:middle
And you see what's
going on on the watch.

1213
00:54:58,566 --> 00:55:01,576 A:middle
That's Pacemaker for
Apple Watch and iPhone.
