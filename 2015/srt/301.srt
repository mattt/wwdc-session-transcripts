00:00:19,056 --> 00:00:20,966 A:middle
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: Good morning
and welcome to session 301.

2
00:00:21,316 --> 00:00:24,376 A:middle
I'm Todd Fernandez, and I manage
Apple's device management tools

3
00:00:24,376 --> 00:00:27,246 A:middle
engineering teams and help
coordinate our efforts

4
00:00:27,276 --> 00:00:29,416 A:middle
across the company
to support deploying

5
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:30,766 A:middle
and managing Apple devices.

6
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,296 A:middle
I'm excited to be here
with you this morning

7
00:00:33,496 --> 00:00:36,306 A:middle
to represent the many teams
across Apple that have been hard

8
00:00:36,306 --> 00:00:39,586 A:middle
at work since we last met
and introduce what's new

9
00:00:39,586 --> 00:00:40,886 A:middle
in managing Apple devices.

10
00:00:43,406 --> 00:00:46,316 A:middle
Apple's commitment to education
and enterprise goes back

11
00:00:46,316 --> 00:00:47,546 A:middle
to the beginning of the company.

12
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:49,696 A:middle
Serving the needs of educators

13
00:00:49,696 --> 00:00:51,456 A:middle
and students has been
an important part

14
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,176 A:middle
of Apple throughout its history.

15
00:00:54,886 --> 00:00:58,156 A:middle
Today, there's a whole new world
of devices and content available

16
00:00:58,156 --> 00:00:59,326 A:middle
to teachers and students.

17

18
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

19
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:03,136 A:middle
Technology can now be completely
integrated, both inside

20
00:01:04,176 --> 00:01:05,626 A:middle
and outside of the classroom.

21
00:01:07,336 --> 00:01:10,106 A:middle
But those devices and content
are also critically important

22
00:01:10,106 --> 00:01:10,916 A:middle
in the enterprise.

23
00:01:11,456 --> 00:01:12,536 A:middle
Though Apple's success

24
00:01:12,536 --> 00:01:15,456 A:middle
in the enterprise today
dwarfs any past successes,

25
00:01:16,086 --> 00:01:18,646 A:middle
Apple's interest in fostering
increased productivity

26
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:21,756 A:middle
and enterprise started a long
time ago with the VisiCalc

27
00:01:21,756 --> 00:01:24,436 A:middle
on the Apple II and
continues through the myriad

28
00:01:24,436 --> 00:01:27,836 A:middle
of solutions now based on
iPhones, iPads, and Macs.

29
00:01:28,396 --> 00:01:31,206 A:middle
From the factory
floor to the office.

30
00:01:32,516 --> 00:01:34,746 A:middle
So how can we make it
even easier for schools

31
00:01:34,746 --> 00:01:37,256 A:middle
and businesses to take full
advantage of everything

32
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:38,856 A:middle
that the Apple ecosystem offers?

33
00:01:39,816 --> 00:01:44,596 A:middle
Since the introduction of iPhone
and accelerating with iPad,

34
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,766 A:middle
Apple has created key
technologies and services

35
00:01:48,286 --> 00:01:49,876 A:middle
to enable schools and businesses

36
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,146 A:middle
to make the most
of their devices.

37
00:01:52,436 --> 00:01:54,486 A:middle
This year we are building
on that foundation

38
00:01:55,106 --> 00:01:57,976 A:middle
with a special emphasis on
shared device deployments.

39
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:01,296 A:middle
Now, I need to take a moment
for a brief aside here.

40

41
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

42
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:01,296 A:middle
Now, I need to take a moment
for a brief aside here.

43
00:02:01,506 --> 00:02:03,676 A:middle
I likely will be referring
to these two programs

44
00:02:03,716 --> 00:02:06,496 A:middle
by their three-letter
acronyms, DEP and VPP,

45
00:02:06,496 --> 00:02:07,636 A:middle
throughout this presentation,

46
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:11,406 A:middle
but I owe marketing a dollar
every time I call a Device

47
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:15,686 A:middle
Enrollment Program a dep. If
I slip, don't give me away.

48
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,386 A:middle
I appreciate it.

49
00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:20,526 A:middle
All these device management
features really boil

50
00:02:20,526 --> 00:02:24,056 A:middle
down to helping you spend less
time with your devices looking

51
00:02:24,056 --> 00:02:27,646 A:middle
like this and more
time with your students

52
00:02:28,046 --> 00:02:30,686 A:middle
and employees using them
to do things like this.

53
00:02:32,756 --> 00:02:35,316 A:middle
Now, today we are going to cover
the entire deployment process,

54
00:02:35,506 --> 00:02:38,226 A:middle
highlighting all the new
features in both OSs,

55
00:02:39,396 --> 00:02:41,556 A:middle
the services and
tools along the way.

56
00:02:43,016 --> 00:02:46,366 A:middle
The first step is to enroll your
devices for remote management.

57
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:49,416 A:middle
Of course, the best way
to do that is using DEP,

58
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,126 A:middle
the Device Enrollment Program.

59
00:02:52,096 --> 00:02:53,886 A:middle
Before we jump into the
new features, though,

60
00:02:54,116 --> 00:02:56,686 A:middle
I want to take a moment
to highlight two changes

61
00:02:56,686 --> 00:02:58,026 A:middle
that have already taken place.

62
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:01,136 A:middle
The first is that we've expanded

63

64
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

65
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:01,136 A:middle
The first is that we've expanded

66
00:03:01,136 --> 00:03:03,796 A:middle
from our initial
launch in two countries.

67
00:03:04,616 --> 00:03:07,556 A:middle
The program is now available in
26 countries around the world.

68
00:03:08,846 --> 00:03:11,506 A:middle
And we've dramatically
shortened the time it takes

69
00:03:11,686 --> 00:03:14,566 A:middle
to get replacement
devices into the program.

70
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:18,006 A:middle
So that's great.

71
00:03:18,126 --> 00:03:20,386 A:middle
Now let's talk about what
is new and coming this year.

72
00:03:21,716 --> 00:03:23,086 A:middle
The first feature I want to talk

73
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:25,956 A:middle
about is called Enrollment
Optimization.

74
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:28,126 A:middle
You might be thinking,
what does that mean?

75
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:29,296 A:middle
It's actually very simple.

76
00:03:29,956 --> 00:03:32,726 A:middle
This is a way for the MDM
server managing the device

77
00:03:33,326 --> 00:03:35,156 A:middle
to keep the device
in Setup Assistant

78
00:03:35,196 --> 00:03:36,486 A:middle
until it is fully configured.

79
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:40,476 A:middle
This ensures that before
a user can use the device,

80
00:03:40,726 --> 00:03:42,736 A:middle
all the settings,
accounts, and restrictions

81
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:44,136 A:middle
that the organization
wants to have

82
00:03:44,136 --> 00:03:46,356 A:middle
in place are actually in place.

83
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:49,976 A:middle
So how does it work?

84
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:53,106 A:middle
There's a new key that is
part of the DEP settings

85
00:03:53,636 --> 00:03:56,176 A:middle
that specifies that you
want the device to wait

86
00:03:56,176 --> 00:03:57,226 A:middle
until it's fully configured.

87
00:03:58,346 --> 00:04:01,976 A:middle
When the device obtains its
Device Enrollment Program

88

89
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

90
00:03:58,346 --> 00:04:01,976 A:middle
When the device obtains its
Device Enrollment Program

91
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:05,436 A:middle
settings from the service,
when it is enrolling

92
00:04:05,436 --> 00:04:08,366 A:middle
with the MDM server, it passes
that state back to the server.

93
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:12,406 A:middle
The server then knows it can
take as many MDM commands

94
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:14,256 A:middle
and install as many
configuration profiles

95
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:17,036 A:middle
as necessary to fully
configure that device.

96
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:19,646 A:middle
Once the device is
fully configured,

97
00:04:20,346 --> 00:04:22,796 A:middle
the server sends a New
Device Configured command

98
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:25,496 A:middle
to the device, allowing
it to exit Setup Assistant

99
00:04:25,686 --> 00:04:27,486 A:middle
and be used by the end user.

100
00:04:28,046 --> 00:04:33,886 A:middle
This is available in both
iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan.

101
00:04:34,386 --> 00:04:37,176 A:middle
Next I want to talk about
a feature specific to OS X

102
00:04:38,216 --> 00:04:41,336 A:middle
that gives you more control
over how accounts are created,

103
00:04:41,336 --> 00:04:44,376 A:middle
or not created as the case
may be, during enrollment.

104
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:49,546 A:middle
In fact, you can now prevent
user creation entirely

105
00:04:49,546 --> 00:04:53,096 A:middle
if you just want to use
network accounts on your Macs.

106
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:55,356 A:middle
This works great with
Enrollment Optimization

107
00:04:55,676 --> 00:04:57,306 A:middle
if you set a passcode policy.

108
00:04:57,836 --> 00:04:59,186 A:middle
That policy will be enforced

109
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:00,796 A:middle
when the user is creating
their new account.

110

111
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

112
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:00,796 A:middle
when the user is creating
their new account.

113
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:05,746 A:middle
One of the most important
changes is that now instead

114
00:05:05,746 --> 00:05:09,806 A:middle
of the user creating an admin
account during DEP enrollment,

115
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:12,316 A:middle
you can specify that that
account will be a standard

116
00:05:12,316 --> 00:05:14,816 A:middle
account, which is typically
what you want in education.

117
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:18,266 A:middle
However, because
OS X, of course,

118
00:05:18,326 --> 00:05:22,096 A:middle
requires an admin account to be
on the system, if you specify

119
00:05:22,096 --> 00:05:23,616 A:middle
that the standard
account will be created,

120
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:27,026 A:middle
you can also create an admin
account behind the scenes

121
00:05:27,506 --> 00:05:28,296 A:middle
that you can later use

122
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:30,596 A:middle
for remote management
via ARD or other tools.

123
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:33,726 A:middle
And you can optionally
hide that admin account

124
00:05:33,726 --> 00:05:35,516 A:middle
from any standard
users on the system.

125
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:39,016 A:middle
All these settings can be
configured using a new MDM

126
00:05:39,016 --> 00:05:41,956 A:middle
command called Setup
Configuration, which works well

127
00:05:41,956 --> 00:05:45,316 A:middle
in conjunction with Enrollment
Optimization [applause].

128
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:47,426 A:middle
>> TODD FERNANDEZ:
This is great.

129
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:49,846 A:middle
It will be very key in
education in particular.

130
00:05:50,156 --> 00:05:53,866 A:middle
Now let's turn to iOS 9
and to a feature again

131
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:56,196 A:middle
with a somewhat ambiguous
name, but I'll explain.

132
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,016 A:middle
Also very simple to explain.

133
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:01,536 A:middle
Automated Enrollment is a
way to enroll your devices

134

135
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

136
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:01,536 A:middle
Automated Enrollment is a
way to enroll your devices

137
00:06:01,656 --> 00:06:03,916 A:middle
in MDM using the Device
Enrollment Program

138
00:06:04,036 --> 00:06:07,416 A:middle
without anyone tapping
on the device.

139
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,256 A:middle
How does it work?

140
00:06:10,476 --> 00:06:13,446 A:middle
Well, the first step is you
configure your DEP settings

141
00:06:13,446 --> 00:06:14,276 A:middle
like you would today,

142
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:17,826 A:middle
but instead of having a
user get the device and walk

143
00:06:17,826 --> 00:06:21,166 A:middle
through the Setup Assistant,
you will connect the device

144
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,756 A:middle
to Apple Configurator,
which will tell the device

145
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:26,396 A:middle
"configure yourself
using your DEP settings."

146
00:06:27,456 --> 00:06:29,146 A:middle
The device obtains
those settings

147
00:06:30,076 --> 00:06:32,786 A:middle
and fully configures itself
all the way to the Home screen.

148
00:06:32,856 --> 00:06:34,376 A:middle
It's ready for the user to use

149
00:06:34,646 --> 00:06:36,216 A:middle
without anyone touching
the device.

150
00:06:37,176 --> 00:06:39,246 A:middle
This is a great feature
for shared deployments

151
00:06:39,246 --> 00:06:42,846 A:middle
in particular, enabling you
to configure a cart of iPads

152
00:06:42,846 --> 00:06:45,516 A:middle
without touching them beyond
connecting the USB cable.

153
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:52,166 A:middle
This is not a new
feature per se,

154
00:06:52,426 --> 00:06:55,096 A:middle
but we've expanded the number
of Setup Assistant panes

155
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:57,306 A:middle
that you can choose
to skip as part

156
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:59,106 A:middle
of your Device Enrollment
Program settings.

157
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:01,836 A:middle
Over the past year, we
rolled out these three panes,

158

159
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

160
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:01,836 A:middle
Over the past year, we
rolled out these three panes,

161
00:07:02,326 --> 00:07:06,476 A:middle
but in iOS 9 you can also remove
the new Move From Android option

162
00:07:06,546 --> 00:07:09,106 A:middle
on the setup pane if
your enterprise wants

163
00:07:09,106 --> 00:07:11,016 A:middle
to make sure there's no
corporate data leaking

164
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:13,906 A:middle
from their Android devices
while they're transitioning

165
00:07:13,906 --> 00:07:14,946 A:middle
to an iOS device.

166
00:07:15,856 --> 00:07:16,516 A:middle
>> TODD FERNANDEZ:
Finally I would

167
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:19,726 A:middle
like to highlight something
I mentioned last year, that,

168
00:07:21,586 --> 00:07:24,066 A:middle
analogous to what the
MDM server can obtain

169
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:26,166 A:middle
from the iTunes Store,
to get the Store Bag,

170
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:29,086 A:middle
which tells you all the
APIs and URLs you can use

171
00:07:29,146 --> 00:07:32,846 A:middle
to control the VPP
program and other tasks,

172
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:36,896 A:middle
MDM servers can implement
what we call MDMServiceConfig,

173
00:07:37,586 --> 00:07:40,146 A:middle
which will tell other device
management tools, for example,

174
00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:43,586 A:middle
Configurator, what kinds
of services it provides,

175
00:07:43,906 --> 00:07:46,786 A:middle
the most important being
the DEP enrollment URL.

176
00:07:47,716 --> 00:07:48,646 A:middle
Why is that important?

177
00:07:48,646 --> 00:07:50,926 A:middle
In fact, the Profile
Manager version

178
00:07:50,926 --> 00:07:53,926 A:middle
that we seeded this
week supports this,

179
00:07:54,316 --> 00:07:56,756 A:middle
and Apple Configurator we
seeded this week supports it.

180
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,866 A:middle
And enables Configurator user,
instead of having to type

181
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:03,256 A:middle
in the entire URL, can
just type in the host name

182

183
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

184
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:03,256 A:middle
in the entire URL, can
just type in the host name

185
00:08:03,256 --> 00:08:06,236 A:middle
of the MDM server and
obtain the URL for the user.

186
00:08:06,826 --> 00:08:10,476 A:middle
So that brings us to the end
of the enrollment section.

187
00:08:10,476 --> 00:08:12,156 A:middle
We now have our devices
enrolled, they're ready

188
00:08:12,156 --> 00:08:13,026 A:middle
for remote management.

189
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:16,806 A:middle
The next thing we want to
do is deploy the great apps

190
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:19,056 A:middle
from the App Store
and other sources.

191
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:23,006 A:middle
Of course, there are,
what did we say yesterday?

192
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:24,576 A:middle
A million and a half
apps in the App Store.

193
00:08:25,196 --> 00:08:28,076 A:middle
There are also a large number
of B2B apps in the App Store.

194
00:08:28,906 --> 00:08:30,506 A:middle
There are in-house
enterprise apps

195
00:08:30,506 --> 00:08:32,135 A:middle
that your organizations
may be creating,

196
00:08:32,756 --> 00:08:35,996 A:middle
and developers may be using
ad hoc apps to distribute,

197
00:08:35,996 --> 00:08:37,535 A:middle
for beta testing
or other purposes,

198
00:08:37,606 --> 00:08:38,946 A:middle
using provisioning profiles.

199
00:08:39,846 --> 00:08:42,785 A:middle
I will talk primarily today
about the first three,

200
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:44,746 A:middle
but there is something
towards the end

201
00:08:44,746 --> 00:08:47,016 A:middle
of the presentation also
potentially relevant

202
00:08:47,016 --> 00:08:48,206 A:middle
for that fourth type.

203
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:51,616 A:middle
There are many different ways
to distribute apps to users,

204
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:55,736 A:middle
but today I'm going to
primarily focus on Apple's tools

205
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,066 A:middle
as well as MDM in general.

206
00:08:57,516 --> 00:09:01,286 A:middle
Finally, there are three
different ways to purchase apps.

207

208
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

209
00:08:57,516 --> 00:09:01,286 A:middle
Finally, there are three
different ways to purchase apps.

210
00:09:02,016 --> 00:09:03,366 A:middle
Your users, of course,
can just go

211
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:04,426 A:middle
to the App Store and buy them.

212
00:09:05,686 --> 00:09:07,326 A:middle
We have VPP redemption codes,

213
00:09:07,456 --> 00:09:09,306 A:middle
which transfer ownership
to the user.

214
00:09:10,146 --> 00:09:11,446 A:middle
Finally two years ago,

215
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:13,546 A:middle
we introduced VPP
managed distribution

216
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:17,086 A:middle
to give organizations greater
control and preserve ownership

217
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:20,336 A:middle
of the apps they buy under
the Volume Purchase Program.

218
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:24,126 A:middle
That's what I want to spend
our time right now on.

219
00:09:24,746 --> 00:09:28,966 A:middle
There are three big new changes
that I want to highlight today,

220
00:09:28,966 --> 00:09:30,626 A:middle
each one larger than the last.

221
00:09:31,316 --> 00:09:35,156 A:middle
The first is similar to the
Device Enrollment Program.

222
00:09:35,246 --> 00:09:37,476 A:middle
Over the past year we
expanded from 10 countries

223
00:09:37,596 --> 00:09:39,226 A:middle
to the same 26 countries

224
00:09:39,306 --> 00:09:41,176 A:middle
where the Device Enrollment
Program is available.

225
00:09:41,796 --> 00:09:42,746 A:middle
That's great.

226
00:09:43,386 --> 00:09:44,316 A:middle
But the second item I want

227
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:47,746 A:middle
to mention is bigger
and builds on this.

228
00:09:47,746 --> 00:09:50,176 A:middle
We now have multinational
app assignment as part

229
00:09:50,176 --> 00:09:51,636 A:middle
of VPP managed distribution.

230
00:09:52,006 --> 00:09:52,936 A:middle
What does that mean [applause]?

231
00:09:54,406 --> 00:09:56,826 A:middle
>> TODD FERNANDEZ:
Maybe you know already!

232
00:09:56,826 --> 00:09:58,376 A:middle
We can go right through
this slide quickly.

233
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:02,236 A:middle
What that means is you can
purchase your VPP apps in any

234

235
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

236
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:02,236 A:middle
What that means is you can
purchase your VPP apps in any

237
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:06,346 A:middle
of those 26 countries, but
distribute them to any country

238
00:10:06,346 --> 00:10:07,836 A:middle
where that app is
in the App Store.

239
00:10:08,326 --> 00:10:09,606 A:middle
So to make it concrete,

240
00:10:09,716 --> 00:10:12,206 A:middle
if you are a multinational
company headquartered in France,

241
00:10:12,506 --> 00:10:15,216 A:middle
you can buy all your apps in
France but distribute them

242
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:18,016 A:middle
to your users in the U.S.,
Canada, or even Kenya,

243
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:20,356 A:middle
as long as that app is in
the App Store in Kenya.

244
00:10:21,536 --> 00:10:22,826 A:middle
We think this is
going to be huge.

245
00:10:23,226 --> 00:10:26,626 A:middle
Believe it or not, the next
one is even bigger than this.

246
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,366 A:middle
You can now assign your VPP mass
distribution apps to devices.

247
00:10:31,516 --> 00:10:35,606 A:middle
[ Applause ]

248
00:10:36,106 --> 00:10:36,476 A:middle
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: Thank you.

249
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,506 A:middle
We appreciate that.

250
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:40,476 A:middle
So previously you could
assign them to users,

251
00:10:40,476 --> 00:10:42,556 A:middle
and iTunes Store Apple ID.

252
00:10:43,016 --> 00:10:44,986 A:middle
What is different about
device assignments?

253
00:10:45,786 --> 00:10:48,156 A:middle
Now there is no invitation
process if you want

254
00:10:48,156 --> 00:10:49,276 A:middle
to use device assignments

255
00:10:49,426 --> 00:10:51,866 A:middle
because there's no Apple ID
required on the device in order

256
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:55,936 A:middle
to distribute the apps,
install them, and run.

257
00:10:56,136 --> 00:10:59,716 A:middle
Even if there is an iTunes Apple
ID configured on the device,

258

259
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

260
00:11:00,196 --> 00:11:02,316 A:middle
these apps will not appear in
the user's purchase history

261
00:11:02,316 --> 00:11:04,136 A:middle
because they are not
assigned to that user.

262
00:11:04,976 --> 00:11:08,346 A:middle
That further means there is
no way for the user to manage

263
00:11:08,346 --> 00:11:12,196 A:middle
that app, or install it, or
update it in the device UI.

264
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:14,636 A:middle
It's completely at the
discretion of the administrator

265
00:11:14,636 --> 00:11:16,806 A:middle
and the MDM server to
control that timing.

266
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:20,176 A:middle
A final difference I want
to highlight is that,

267
00:11:20,176 --> 00:11:23,286 A:middle
in contrast to user assignments,
where that app can be installed

268
00:11:23,286 --> 00:11:26,526 A:middle
on any device where that iTunes
Store Apple ID is configured,

269
00:11:26,526 --> 00:11:29,096 A:middle
if you are using device
assignments you need

270
00:11:29,096 --> 00:11:32,766 A:middle
to purchase a copy for each
device, and you app developers

271
00:11:32,766 --> 00:11:34,276 A:middle
out there should be
happy about that.

272
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:35,186 A:middle
More sales!

273
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:40,096 A:middle
But I also want to repeat,
there is no Apple ID required

274
00:11:40,096 --> 00:11:41,936 A:middle
on the device in
order to install apps.

275
00:11:42,516 --> 00:11:48,056 A:middle
[ Cheers & Applause ]

276
00:11:48,556 --> 00:11:49,956 A:middle
>> TODD FERNANDEZ:
Another big step forward

277
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:52,156 A:middle
to make shared device
deployments much easier.

278
00:11:54,236 --> 00:11:55,856 A:middle
So what has remained the same?

279
00:11:56,636 --> 00:11:58,846 A:middle
The purchasing experience
is exactly the same.

280
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:03,066 A:middle
You purchase VPP managed
distribution licenses

281

282
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

283
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:03,066 A:middle
You purchase VPP managed
distribution licenses

284
00:12:03,066 --> 00:12:08,106 A:middle
on the VPP store, and they can
be freely reassigned to a user

285
00:12:08,106 --> 00:12:10,706 A:middle
or a device and later
revoked and assigned

286
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:11,996 A:middle
to a different user or device.

287
00:12:13,056 --> 00:12:14,376 A:middle
We've also worked very hard

288
00:12:14,376 --> 00:12:17,306 A:middle
to make sure there's a smooth
transition for all of the apps

289
00:12:17,306 --> 00:12:20,196 A:middle
that have already been installed
based on user assignments.

290
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:24,346 A:middle
If you wish, you can transfer
and transition that assignment

291
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:27,366 A:middle
to a device assignment without
having to reinstall the app

292
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:28,966 A:middle
or risk losing user data.

293
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:31,706 A:middle
The app stays in place,
as does the user data.

294
00:12:32,516 --> 00:12:38,686 A:middle
[ Applause ]

295
00:12:39,186 --> 00:12:40,886 A:middle
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: So what does
this mean for app developers?

296
00:12:41,726 --> 00:12:42,826 A:middle
It is actually pretty simple.

297
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:46,416 A:middle
First of all, early next month,
iTunes Connect will allow you

298
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,566 A:middle
to opt in to allow your
app to be distributed

299
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:50,626 A:middle
as a device assignment.

300
00:12:52,046 --> 00:12:53,166 A:middle
This is probably a good idea.

301
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:56,246 A:middle
Remember that piece I mentioned,
you might sell more copies?

302
00:12:57,146 --> 00:13:00,486 A:middle
Also, if your app is
checking the receipt to ensure

303

304
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

305
00:12:57,146 --> 00:13:00,486 A:middle
Also, if your app is
checking the receipt to ensure

306
00:13:00,486 --> 00:13:04,486 A:middle
that it is running on a device
where a user is configured

307
00:13:04,486 --> 00:13:06,296 A:middle
that is the same user
the app is assigned to,

308
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:08,586 A:middle
you'll want to update
that checking to do

309
00:13:08,586 --> 00:13:10,386 A:middle
that to make sure it's
running on the device

310
00:13:10,426 --> 00:13:12,836 A:middle
that it's been assigned to.

311
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:14,376 A:middle
Secondly, I want to make a pitch

312
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,836 A:middle
that device assignments
are a great feature

313
00:13:16,836 --> 00:13:19,506 A:middle
for shared device
deployments, but another one

314
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:22,466 A:middle
for you app developers is to
move, if you haven't already,

315
00:13:22,746 --> 00:13:25,066 A:middle
to store your app's data
and settings in the cloud,

316
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,456 A:middle
whether it's Apple's
cloud with iCloud Drive

317
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:29,166 A:middle
if you're document-based,
or CloudKit,

318
00:13:29,646 --> 00:13:31,116 A:middle
or your own cloud-based storage.

319
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,936 A:middle
This will help your app fit in
better in shared deployments.

320
00:13:36,446 --> 00:13:39,266 A:middle
There are a number of sessions
this week that will show you how

321
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:40,856 A:middle
to do that with our
own solutions.

322
00:13:41,376 --> 00:13:42,666 A:middle
I encourage you to
check those out.

323
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:46,866 A:middle
I also want to highlight
a change

324
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:49,366 A:middle
to the caching server
feature of OS X server,

325
00:13:49,516 --> 00:13:55,886 A:middle
which already caches
OS updates and apps.

326
00:13:56,546 --> 00:14:01,666 A:middle
It now caches also iCloud data,
including Drive documents,

327

328
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

329
00:13:56,546 --> 00:14:01,666 A:middle
It now caches also iCloud data,
including Drive documents,

330
00:14:01,816 --> 00:14:04,366 A:middle
CloudKit data, and iCloud
photo library photos.

331
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:07,456 A:middle
And those of you who have
now heard about App Thinning

332
00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:10,196 A:middle
and on-demand resources, it
will also cache those as well.

333
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,816 A:middle
It just preheats the cache
of cloud data on your network

334
00:14:13,816 --> 00:14:16,056 A:middle
to give you better performance
and reduce your bandwidth,

335
00:14:16,696 --> 00:14:18,566 A:middle
and of course all of the data

336
00:14:18,696 --> 00:14:21,596 A:middle
in the cache is encrypted
using keys only present

337
00:14:21,596 --> 00:14:22,786 A:middle
on the client device.

338
00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:28,116 A:middle
So turning to what this
means for MDM developers,

339
00:14:28,986 --> 00:14:31,986 A:middle
if you are supporting VPP
managed distribution already,

340
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:34,406 A:middle
there are a few changes
to the iTunes Store APIs,

341
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:36,046 A:middle
which I'll cover in a moment.

342
00:14:37,096 --> 00:14:39,236 A:middle
You will use the same
Install Application command

343
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:42,166 A:middle
to the device to tell
it to install this app.

344
00:14:42,956 --> 00:14:45,686 A:middle
You obviously should now
support assigning apps

345
00:14:45,686 --> 00:14:47,046 A:middle
to devices and device groups.

346
00:14:47,776 --> 00:14:50,066 A:middle
We've built all of
this to make it easier

347
00:14:50,066 --> 00:14:52,506 A:middle
to centralize the app's
management workflows.

348
00:14:52,506 --> 00:14:54,906 A:middle
It will be much more reliable
with device assignments

349
00:14:54,906 --> 00:14:58,636 A:middle
to be able if you wish to unify
the assignment in the Store

350
00:14:58,676 --> 00:15:00,306 A:middle
with the installation
command to the device.

351

352
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

353
00:14:58,676 --> 00:15:00,306 A:middle
with the installation
command to the device.

354
00:15:00,306 --> 00:15:06,386 A:middle
So what are the changes for the
Install Application command?

355
00:15:07,426 --> 00:15:10,026 A:middle
Well, if the app is not
installed, it will install it.

356
00:15:11,016 --> 00:15:13,386 A:middle
If it already has been
installed by the MDM server

357
00:15:13,476 --> 00:15:15,116 A:middle
and is managed, it
will update it.

358
00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:18,086 A:middle
If the user already
installed the app so it's

359
00:15:18,476 --> 00:15:21,396 A:middle
in an unmanaged state, the
installation will fail,

360
00:15:21,606 --> 00:15:23,316 A:middle
so your server will
need to handle that case

361
00:15:23,316 --> 00:15:24,406 A:middle
and respond appropriately.

362
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:28,696 A:middle
For those of you who are already
supporting this for OS X,

363
00:15:28,696 --> 00:15:31,796 A:middle
hopefully all of you, for
device assignments you want

364
00:15:31,846 --> 00:15:34,446 A:middle
to use the same purchase method
you have been using on OS X,

365
00:15:34,656 --> 00:15:37,406 A:middle
purchase method one for
iOS device assignments.

366
00:15:38,886 --> 00:15:40,146 A:middle
That's the command
to the device.

367
00:15:40,146 --> 00:15:42,416 A:middle
Now let's turn to the
command for the iTunes Store

368
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:46,146 A:middle
to update its records on which
app is assigned to which device.

369
00:15:47,556 --> 00:15:50,856 A:middle
There are two new APIs that
should make implementing support

370
00:15:50,856 --> 00:15:53,126 A:middle
for VPP managed distribution
much easier.

371
00:15:53,806 --> 00:15:59,216 A:middle
The first supersedes the
separate commands to associate

372
00:15:59,216 --> 00:16:01,246 A:middle
and disassociate
licenses with users.

373

374
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

375
00:15:59,216 --> 00:16:01,246 A:middle
and disassociate
licenses with users.

376
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:05,596 A:middle
And it allows you to, with
one call for a single app,

377
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:09,846 A:middle
to associate with any
number of users or devices

378
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:12,106 A:middle
and disassociate any
number of users or devices.

379
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,896 A:middle
This will make it
very easy to implement

380
00:16:13,896 --> 00:16:15,726 A:middle
that smooth migration
I mentioned earlier.

381
00:16:17,096 --> 00:16:21,956 A:middle
The second API gives you
an easy way to get the list

382
00:16:21,956 --> 00:16:24,946 A:middle
of apps the organization has
purchased, including the number

383
00:16:24,946 --> 00:16:26,906 A:middle
of licenses of each app
that they have purchased

384
00:16:26,906 --> 00:16:28,586 A:middle
without having to
fetch the entire list

385
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:30,446 A:middle
of every single license
they purchased.

386
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:35,056 A:middle
This will make it much easier to
build a responsive app library

387
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:36,036 A:middle
in your admin console.

388
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:41,116 A:middle
Moving on to an existing API

389
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:43,296 A:middle
that has gotten several
new fields.

390
00:16:44,756 --> 00:16:48,126 A:middle
There are max limits for
the number of licenses

391
00:16:48,126 --> 00:16:52,206 A:middle
that manage VPP licenses,
API just mentioned.

392
00:16:52,996 --> 00:16:55,666 A:middle
You want to respect these values
when you're calling that API

393
00:16:56,726 --> 00:16:58,586 A:middle
to not call with
more than that number

394
00:16:58,586 --> 00:17:01,766 A:middle
of licenses in a single call.

395

396
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

397
00:16:58,586 --> 00:17:01,766 A:middle
of licenses in a single call.

398
00:17:01,976 --> 00:17:05,415 A:middle
We also have added a new
Retry After header because,

399
00:17:05,606 --> 00:17:06,965 A:middle
how can I say this delicately?

400
00:17:06,965 --> 00:17:07,506 A:middle
I'll be blunt.

401
00:17:08,346 --> 00:17:12,526 A:middle
Some of you, and we know who
you are, have some MDM solutions

402
00:17:12,526 --> 00:17:15,566 A:middle
that let's just say they
send a few too many requests

403
00:17:15,566 --> 00:17:16,465 A:middle
to the iTunes store.

404
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:21,596 A:middle
We need you to fix that but
also respect this header

405
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:24,955 A:middle
because if your solution
continues to do that,

406
00:17:24,955 --> 00:17:29,006 A:middle
we will send this header and
we may, if you ignore it,

407
00:17:29,696 --> 00:17:32,536 A:middle
create longer delays in
rejecting your commands

408
00:17:32,536 --> 00:17:35,566 A:middle
and potentially even suspend
the account of your customer.

409
00:17:36,826 --> 00:17:39,256 A:middle
So please, adopt this.

410
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:41,416 A:middle
All right.

411
00:17:41,906 --> 00:17:44,646 A:middle
So moving away from strictly
VPP managed distribution

412
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,936 A:middle
to some more general
app distribution topics.

413
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:48,796 A:middle
There are a few things
that are new.

414
00:17:48,796 --> 00:17:51,086 A:middle
Really, they are
just more convenient.

415
00:17:51,646 --> 00:17:54,626 A:middle
The first is reiterating
the point I made earlier

416
00:17:54,626 --> 00:17:57,436 A:middle
that we've made a very
smooth migration from user

417
00:17:57,436 --> 00:18:00,186 A:middle
to device assignments to leave
the app and data in place.

418

419
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

420
00:17:57,436 --> 00:18:00,186 A:middle
to device assignments to leave
the app and data in place.

421
00:18:01,066 --> 00:18:04,906 A:middle
Secondly, if the app has
already been installed unmanaged

422
00:18:04,906 --> 00:18:07,696 A:middle
by the user, it is now
possible to convert that app

423
00:18:07,696 --> 00:18:09,926 A:middle
to managed state without
having to reinstall

424
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:10,866 A:middle
or lose user data [applause].

425
00:18:15,046 --> 00:18:16,696 A:middle
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: I'll give
you the details in a moment,

426
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:21,356 A:middle
but the third change is that
you can now install apps via MDM

427
00:18:21,356 --> 00:18:23,806 A:middle
or Configurator even if
you disabled the App Store.

428
00:18:24,856 --> 00:18:27,856 A:middle
Great improvement for
education in particular.

429
00:18:29,016 --> 00:18:29,876 A:middle
How does this work?

430
00:18:31,196 --> 00:18:34,366 A:middle
Changing an app from unmanaged
state to managed state is

431
00:18:34,366 --> 00:18:37,016 A:middle
as simple as sending a new
Install Application command,

432
00:18:37,226 --> 00:18:40,036 A:middle
with this new field, Change
Management State equals Managed.

433
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:44,006 A:middle
And this will happen silently
on a supervised device.

434
00:18:44,006 --> 00:18:44,826 A:middle
That's it.

435
00:18:45,496 --> 00:18:48,436 A:middle
If it's an unsupervised
device, you can use this,

436
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:50,736 A:middle
but the user will be
prompted to accept the change.

437
00:18:52,126 --> 00:18:55,016 A:middle
Once that change has happened,
managed open in will consider

438
00:18:55,016 --> 00:18:57,096 A:middle
that app to be managed and
all of that data will be

439
00:18:57,096 --> 00:19:00,626 A:middle
within the managed sphere,
just as if it had always been.

440

441
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

442
00:18:57,096 --> 00:19:00,626 A:middle
within the managed sphere,
just as if it had always been.

443
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,126 A:middle
If the app is not
installed at all,

444
00:19:03,126 --> 00:19:04,236 A:middle
and you're passing this call,

445
00:19:04,236 --> 00:19:06,296 A:middle
it will still install
the app as a managed app.

446
00:19:08,506 --> 00:19:09,766 A:middle
That's great.

447
00:19:10,096 --> 00:19:14,136 A:middle
This works for App Store apps,
all the different types of apps.

448
00:19:14,176 --> 00:19:17,796 A:middle
Let's talk about changes
for enterprise apps.

449
00:19:17,796 --> 00:19:21,406 A:middle
We've created in iOS 9 a new
UI flow to make it easier

450
00:19:21,406 --> 00:19:22,876 A:middle
for the user to understand

451
00:19:22,876 --> 00:19:24,776 A:middle
when they are installing
an enterprise app

452
00:19:24,776 --> 00:19:25,956 A:middle
from a new developer.

453
00:19:26,636 --> 00:19:28,556 A:middle
I'll show you what
that looks like.

454
00:19:29,556 --> 00:19:31,906 A:middle
We also made it easier for
you to avoid your users

455
00:19:31,906 --> 00:19:35,046 A:middle
from ever having to see that
great new user experience

456
00:19:35,496 --> 00:19:37,976 A:middle
because you can prevent
them from trusting new apps

457
00:19:38,086 --> 00:19:41,556 A:middle
from other developers so that
they can only use your in-house

458
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:43,386 A:middle
enterprise apps.

459
00:19:43,386 --> 00:19:45,536 A:middle
And if they have enrolled
with your MDM server,

460
00:19:45,926 --> 00:19:49,766 A:middle
they have implicitly given their
trust to you as a developer,

461
00:19:49,766 --> 00:19:52,926 A:middle
and so any apps that
you install the MDM

462
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:55,276 A:middle
that are your enterprise
in-house apps will be

463
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:56,106 A:middle
installed silently.

464
00:19:57,516 --> 00:20:01,576 A:middle
[ Applause ]

465

466
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

467
00:19:57,516 --> 00:20:01,576 A:middle
[ Applause ]

468
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,726 A:middle
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: So if
it is an enterprise app

469
00:20:03,726 --> 00:20:05,546 A:middle
from a developer that
they haven't trusted yet,

470
00:20:05,546 --> 00:20:06,476 A:middle
what does that look like?

471
00:20:07,876 --> 00:20:09,036 A:middle
Well, it looks like this.

472
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:13,766 A:middle
After they installed the app
and launch it, they can dismiss

473
00:20:13,826 --> 00:20:18,256 A:middle
that alert and then switch over
to Settings and the profiles

474
00:20:18,256 --> 00:20:20,426 A:middle
and remote management
area of Settings,

475
00:20:20,426 --> 00:20:23,666 A:middle
which was changed quite a
bit and improved in iOS 8,

476
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,226 A:middle
they can trust the app.

477
00:20:27,006 --> 00:20:27,886 A:middle
And that's it.

478
00:20:27,886 --> 00:20:29,536 A:middle
And then any further apps

479
00:20:29,536 --> 00:20:31,856 A:middle
from that developer will
be automatically trusted,

480
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:35,176 A:middle
but they can also always come
back here and remove that trust.

481
00:20:35,946 --> 00:20:37,336 A:middle
It's just that easy.

482
00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:41,336 A:middle
Let's now turn to B2B apps.

483
00:20:42,816 --> 00:20:45,166 A:middle
Those of you who have
worked on MDM console

484
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:48,036 A:middle
or have used one know
that it's really great.

485
00:20:48,036 --> 00:20:51,226 A:middle
You can have an app library
that has the nice app metadata

486
00:20:51,226 --> 00:20:54,126 A:middle
with the icon, the app name,
and any other details about it.

487
00:20:54,766 --> 00:20:58,726 A:middle
But if it's a B2B app, it
looks something more like this.

488
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:02,786 A:middle
Wa Wa. Well, I really
have good news for you.

489

490
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

491
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:02,786 A:middle
Wa Wa. Well, I really
have good news for you.

492
00:21:02,786 --> 00:21:05,636 A:middle
Later this summer
you will be able

493
00:21:05,636 --> 00:21:08,376 A:middle
to get the same app metadata
for B2B apps that you can

494
00:21:08,376 --> 00:21:09,466 A:middle
for App Store apps today.

495
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,766 A:middle
So you can make a nice
experience for your users.

496
00:21:12,266 --> 00:21:15,436 A:middle
What's more, that will also
allow you to get the metadata

497
00:21:15,436 --> 00:21:17,506 A:middle
for any apps that have been
removed from the App Store.

498
00:21:17,866 --> 00:21:22,276 A:middle
I thought you would be
more enthusiastic about it.

499
00:21:22,276 --> 00:21:23,586 A:middle
Where are all the MDM
developers [applause]?

500
00:21:26,456 --> 00:21:27,666 A:middle
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: All right.

501
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,206 A:middle
At this point, we reached the
end of our distribution section.

502
00:21:30,396 --> 00:21:33,846 A:middle
I would like to ask Shruti Gupta
to come up here and demo a bunch

503
00:21:33,846 --> 00:21:37,026 A:middle
of these features on Macs
running OS X El Capitan.

504
00:21:37,806 --> 00:21:39,086 A:middle
Take it away.

505
00:21:44,086 --> 00:21:44,956 A:middle
>> SHRUTI GUPTA: Good
morning, everyone.

506
00:21:44,956 --> 00:21:47,796 A:middle
I am each excited to show
you some of the cool features

507
00:21:47,796 --> 00:21:48,976 A:middle
that Todd talked about.

508
00:21:49,836 --> 00:21:52,766 A:middle
The first thing I will demo
are the new enhancements

509
00:21:52,766 --> 00:21:55,506 A:middle
that we have made in account
creation and password policy.

510
00:21:56,086 --> 00:22:02,326 A:middle
So here is my profile
manager in OS X server.

511

512
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

513
00:21:56,086 --> 00:22:02,326 A:middle
So here is my profile
manager in OS X server.

514
00:22:02,646 --> 00:22:07,396 A:middle
I am using this profile manager
server as my MDM solution

515
00:22:08,116 --> 00:22:10,116 A:middle
where I have a couple of
Macs that are registered

516
00:22:10,116 --> 00:22:11,536 A:middle
in Device Enrollment Program.

517
00:22:11,536 --> 00:22:13,476 A:middle
If you look at the settings,

518
00:22:13,476 --> 00:22:16,676 A:middle
you can see that I've
already created DEP profile

519
00:22:16,676 --> 00:22:17,476 A:middle
for the device group.

520
00:22:17,686 --> 00:22:21,666 A:middle
I have skipped all the
Setup Assistant panes except

521
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,056 A:middle
for the local account setup.

522
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,006 A:middle
This is a new feature
that would force the user

523
00:22:26,006 --> 00:22:27,886 A:middle
to create a standard
user account.

524
00:22:28,286 --> 00:22:31,306 A:middle
Since OS X requires
an administer account,

525
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:33,746 A:middle
I provided administrator
credentials here.

526
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:35,646 A:middle
You have the ability to show

527
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,886 A:middle
or hide this administrator
account from the user.

528
00:22:38,456 --> 00:22:40,616 A:middle
For today's demonstration
purpose I will hide the

529
00:22:40,616 --> 00:22:41,686 A:middle
administrator account.

530
00:22:42,456 --> 00:22:47,576 A:middle
I have also configured a
passcode profile for these Macs

531
00:22:47,906 --> 00:22:49,496 A:middle
that would require the user

532
00:22:49,496 --> 00:22:51,816 A:middle
to use a complex password
during this setup time.

533
00:22:52,396 --> 00:22:54,106 A:middle
What does this look
like on the client?

534
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:54,896 A:middle
Let's take a look.

535
00:22:55,956 --> 00:22:58,936 A:middle
So here is my Mac that
is registered in DEP

536
00:22:58,936 --> 00:23:02,556 A:middle
and has been booted for the
first time OS X El Capitan,

537

538
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

539
00:22:58,936 --> 00:23:02,556 A:middle
and has been booted for the
first time OS X El Capitan,

540
00:23:02,646 --> 00:23:04,886 A:middle
mimicking out-of-box
user experience.

541
00:23:05,186 --> 00:23:06,316 A:middle
Let's go through the setup.

542
00:23:06,316 --> 00:23:10,746 A:middle
I select the United States
for my country, U.S. keyboard.

543
00:23:12,056 --> 00:23:16,706 A:middle
Here we are at the configuration
pane, which you will see only

544
00:23:16,706 --> 00:23:21,436 A:middle
if the systems are configured
in DEP. So we come to them.

545
00:23:21,436 --> 00:23:23,416 A:middle
Now, the MDM server is
prompting me to authenticate

546
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:24,946 A:middle
that my directory
server credentials.

547
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:28,016 A:middle
I will enter my user
name, Shruti,

548
00:23:28,766 --> 00:23:30,546 A:middle
and my password, hello kitty.

549
00:23:30,996 --> 00:23:34,956 A:middle
So what it is doing right now,

550
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:37,346 A:middle
it is enrolling this
Mac in the MDM.

551
00:23:37,496 --> 00:23:40,036 A:middle
It is going to fetch all the
configuration profiles ever

552
00:23:40,036 --> 00:23:43,056 A:middle
configured for this
Mac from my MDM server.

553
00:23:43,886 --> 00:23:45,756 A:middle
We are at the user account pane.

554
00:23:45,886 --> 00:23:49,436 A:middle
You will see we've populated
some of the information

555
00:23:49,436 --> 00:23:50,516 A:middle
from the previous login.

556
00:23:50,716 --> 00:23:55,306 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and enter
my full name here, and let's see

557
00:23:55,306 --> 00:23:57,046 A:middle
if it likes my hello
kitty password.

558
00:23:57,676 --> 00:24:01,856 A:middle
Oh, looks like I need to use
a more secure password based

559

560
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

561
00:23:57,676 --> 00:24:01,856 A:middle
Oh, looks like I need to use
a more secure password based

562
00:24:01,856 --> 00:24:03,726 A:middle
on the passcode policy
that we set earlier.

563
00:24:04,006 --> 00:24:06,496 A:middle
I will enter a new
password here.

564
00:24:07,776 --> 00:24:11,016 A:middle
What is cool about this is, it
gives you immediate feedback

565
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,456 A:middle
as I'm entering the password.

566
00:24:13,796 --> 00:24:16,826 A:middle
I'm going to complete the
Password Verification field

567
00:24:16,826 --> 00:24:18,016 A:middle
and continue.

568
00:24:18,786 --> 00:24:22,146 A:middle
So it is creating the
user account as well

569
00:24:22,146 --> 00:24:25,096 A:middle
as the hidden administrator
account in the background.

570
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:28,546 A:middle
I'm going to select the time
zone now, and you'll notice

571
00:24:28,546 --> 00:24:29,926 A:middle
that I didn't have
to go through any

572
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,776 A:middle
of the location services pane
or the iCloud sign in pane

573
00:24:32,776 --> 00:24:37,336 A:middle
because we configured it to skip
all those Setup Assistant panes.

574
00:24:37,336 --> 00:24:39,526 A:middle
Here, our account is all set up.

575
00:24:39,726 --> 00:24:41,946 A:middle
Let's see what kind of
account really got created.

576
00:24:42,246 --> 00:24:43,926 A:middle
I will launch System
Preferences,

577
00:24:44,606 --> 00:24:46,676 A:middle
go to Users and Groups.

578
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,596 A:middle
You can see it is a
standard user account.

579
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,396 A:middle
The administrator
account is not visible.

580
00:24:53,586 --> 00:24:56,706 A:middle
Just to prove that administrator
account really got created,

581
00:24:56,876 --> 00:24:58,236 A:middle
I'm going to unlock the pane

582
00:24:58,236 --> 00:24:59,716 A:middle
with my administrator
credentials

583
00:24:59,716 --> 00:25:01,936 A:middle
that I provided on
the MDM server.

584

585
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

586
00:24:59,716 --> 00:25:01,936 A:middle
that I provided on
the MDM server.

587
00:25:02,326 --> 00:25:05,396 A:middle
Ta-da! You can see that
it's unlocked successfully.

588
00:25:06,556 --> 00:25:09,586 A:middle
The next thing I'm going to demo
is one of the coolest features,

589
00:25:09,586 --> 00:25:11,876 A:middle
and I'm sure many of you
have been waiting for,

590
00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:14,726 A:middle
being able to assign
VPP app to the devices

591
00:25:15,006 --> 00:25:18,136 A:middle
without requiring the user to
log in with their Apple ID.

592
00:25:19,546 --> 00:25:25,986 A:middle
So I'm going to push a VPP app
to this Mac, which is going

593
00:25:25,986 --> 00:25:28,546 A:middle
to be Apple Configurator app.

594
00:25:31,276 --> 00:25:34,156 A:middle
So while it pushes
the app, let's see,

595
00:25:34,156 --> 00:25:37,136 A:middle
check in the App Store
that I'm not signed in.

596
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:40,076 A:middle
So we look at the Store menu.

597
00:25:40,076 --> 00:25:41,766 A:middle
You can see that I'm
not signed in here.

598
00:25:41,766 --> 00:25:43,776 A:middle
If you notice, the app
has already started

599
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:45,006 A:middle
to install in the LaunchPad.

600
00:25:45,066 --> 00:25:48,306 A:middle
There is our Apple
Configurator app.

601
00:25:48,436 --> 00:25:55,446 A:middle
Thank you, back to Todd.

602
00:25:55,446 --> 00:25:55,686 A:middle
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: All right.

603
00:25:55,896 --> 00:25:56,786 A:middle
Thank you very much, Shruti.

604
00:25:57,716 --> 00:25:58,826 A:middle
So what did we just see?

605
00:25:59,076 --> 00:26:01,886 A:middle
Shruti installed a passcode
policy before the user account

606

607
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

608
00:25:59,076 --> 00:26:01,886 A:middle
Shruti installed a passcode
policy before the user account

609
00:26:01,886 --> 00:26:03,696 A:middle
was created, and it
was respected while

610
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:04,886 A:middle
that user account was created.

611
00:26:05,556 --> 00:26:06,766 A:middle
It was a standard user account

612
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:08,426 A:middle
that was created instead
of an admin account.

613
00:26:09,146 --> 00:26:12,576 A:middle
She also created an admin
account that she could use

614
00:26:12,576 --> 00:26:17,136 A:middle
if she needed to log in directly
on the Mac or remotely later.

615
00:26:18,206 --> 00:26:21,696 A:middle
She also showed you assigning
a VPP app to a device.

616
00:26:24,056 --> 00:26:26,886 A:middle
So let's move on to the third
section of today's session

617
00:26:27,536 --> 00:26:30,216 A:middle
and talk about ongoing
management of devices.

618
00:26:30,806 --> 00:26:33,276 A:middle
First, I would like
to highlight the fact

619
00:26:33,276 --> 00:26:36,976 A:middle
that iOS 9 supports
Exchange ActiveSync 16,

620
00:26:37,546 --> 00:26:38,996 A:middle
specifically a number
of improvements

621
00:26:38,996 --> 00:26:41,806 A:middle
to calendar support,
including improved reliability

622
00:26:41,806 --> 00:26:44,886 A:middle
for a number of common tasks
and support for attachments

623
00:26:44,976 --> 00:26:46,116 A:middle
in physical locations.

624
00:26:46,326 --> 00:26:51,836 A:middle
Now let's turn to our own
MDM protocol and profiles.

625
00:26:52,326 --> 00:26:54,216 A:middle
There are a number of
new commands and queries,

626
00:26:54,456 --> 00:26:57,866 A:middle
and the ones I want to highlight
at the top, there's a new query

627
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,306 A:middle
that tells you what software
updates are available

628

629
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

630
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,306 A:middle
that tells you what software
updates are available

631
00:27:00,306 --> 00:27:04,286 A:middle
for that device and a command
that will tell the iOS device

632
00:27:04,286 --> 00:27:08,306 A:middle
to update to the latest
iOS for any devices in DEP.

633
00:27:09,516 --> 00:27:12,546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

634
00:27:13,046 --> 00:27:14,576 A:middle
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: Including
being able to tell the devices

635
00:27:14,576 --> 00:27:17,886 A:middle
to download and stage the update
so you can then command them all

636
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,016 A:middle
to update at the same time.

637
00:27:20,716 --> 00:27:23,336 A:middle
I've already talked about the
remaining commands and queries

638
00:27:23,336 --> 00:27:27,016 A:middle
in the enrollment section
and the distribution section.

639
00:27:27,016 --> 00:27:28,536 A:middle
So I won't spend any
more time on those.

640
00:27:29,496 --> 00:27:32,196 A:middle
Now let's turn to what's new
with configuration profiles.

641
00:27:32,676 --> 00:27:35,616 A:middle
There are two new payloads,
network usage rules,

642
00:27:35,876 --> 00:27:37,426 A:middle
which allows an organization

643
00:27:37,426 --> 00:27:39,906 A:middle
to control how their
managed apps use the network,

644
00:27:40,366 --> 00:27:42,676 A:middle
whether they're allowed
to use cell data or roam.

645
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:47,666 A:middle
The OS X server account
payload configures whether apps

646
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,596 A:middle
that support the document
provider API can access

647
00:27:50,596 --> 00:27:52,516 A:middle
documents on their
OS X server account.

648
00:27:53,456 --> 00:27:54,716 A:middle
There are a number of
other settings added

649
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:57,806 A:middle
to existing payloads,
including a lot of changes

650
00:27:57,836 --> 00:28:02,106 A:middle
in the IKEv2 VPN connection
type, more about that later,

651

652
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

653
00:27:57,836 --> 00:28:02,106 A:middle
in the IKEv2 VPN connection
type, more about that later,

654
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05,036 A:middle
and a large number
of new restrictions.

655
00:28:05,106 --> 00:28:06,056 A:middle
So let's look at those.

656
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,796 A:middle
There are a handful
that are applicable

657
00:28:08,796 --> 00:28:12,036 A:middle
on unsupervised devices,
including the ability

658
00:28:12,036 --> 00:28:14,746 A:middle
to prevent users from trusting
additional enterprise app

659
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:16,296 A:middle
authors that I mentioned
earlier.

660
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:21,946 A:middle
We also now allow you to
tell AirDrop to be treated

661
00:28:21,946 --> 00:28:23,796 A:middle
as an unmanaged destination
[applause].

662
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:25,466 A:middle
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: All right!

663
00:28:25,596 --> 00:28:27,216 A:middle
But the final thing I want

664
00:28:27,216 --> 00:28:30,546 A:middle
to highlight here are
the three restrictions,

665
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:32,856 A:middle
third from the bottom,
modify device name,

666
00:28:32,856 --> 00:28:34,136 A:middle
passcode, and wallpaper.

667
00:28:34,676 --> 00:28:37,526 A:middle
These are particularly useful
in shared device deployments.

668
00:28:37,526 --> 00:28:40,026 A:middle
If you have, say, some
might say creative,

669
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:43,506 A:middle
others might say malicious,
students who like to mess

670
00:28:43,506 --> 00:28:45,686 A:middle
with their devices, you
can now prevent them

671
00:28:45,686 --> 00:28:48,076 A:middle
from changing the device
name, setting a passcode,

672
00:28:48,076 --> 00:28:49,216 A:middle
or changing the wallpaper.

673
00:28:50,516 --> 00:28:53,606 A:middle
[ Applause ]

>> TODD FERNANDEZ:
One final note

675
00:28:54,836 --> 00:28:57,996 A:middle
about configuration profile
restrictions in iOS 9.

676
00:28:58,506 --> 00:29:00,216 A:middle
There are a number
of restrictions,

677

678
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

679
00:28:58,506 --> 00:29:00,216 A:middle
There are a number
of restrictions,

680
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:03,666 A:middle
these nine in fact, created
before supervision existed.

681
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:07,566 A:middle
And in fact, they really
should only be applicable

682
00:29:07,566 --> 00:29:08,806 A:middle
on supervised devices.

683
00:29:09,306 --> 00:29:12,806 A:middle
So this is your early warning
that they are still applicable

684
00:29:12,806 --> 00:29:16,816 A:middle
or they still are honored on
unsupervised devices in iOS 9,

685
00:29:17,326 --> 00:29:19,016 A:middle
but in an iOS version

686
00:29:19,016 --> 00:29:21,206 A:middle
to be named later they
will be only honored

687
00:29:21,206 --> 00:29:22,476 A:middle
on supervised devices.

688
00:29:22,476 --> 00:29:25,006 A:middle
Now let's turn to OS X.

689
00:29:26,596 --> 00:29:31,016 A:middle
Just like in iOS 9, OS X El
Capitan gives you a new query

690
00:29:31,016 --> 00:29:33,376 A:middle
that tells you what software
updates are available

691
00:29:33,376 --> 00:29:36,336 A:middle
for that Mac, and you can
tell it to install one or more

692
00:29:36,336 --> 00:29:37,746 A:middle
of those updates if the Mac is

693
00:29:37,746 --> 00:29:43,846 A:middle
in DEP. The device information
query achieves parity with iOS

694
00:29:44,256 --> 00:29:47,076 A:middle
and you can now obtain, if
you are using user assignments

695
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,426 A:middle
for VPP managed distribution,
you can now see

696
00:29:49,426 --> 00:29:51,456 A:middle
which account is
configured on that device.

697
00:29:52,826 --> 00:29:54,506 A:middle
We already talked about
setup configuration

698
00:29:54,506 --> 00:29:57,006 A:middle
and device-configured commands
in the enrollment section.

699
00:29:58,086 --> 00:30:00,806 A:middle
There's also an active
managed users query,

700

701
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

702
00:29:58,086 --> 00:30:00,806 A:middle
There's also an active
managed users query,

703
00:30:00,946 --> 00:30:04,206 A:middle
which will tell the server
which users are logged in

704
00:30:04,206 --> 00:30:07,246 A:middle
and actively using the
Mac so you can clean

705
00:30:07,246 --> 00:30:09,226 A:middle
up obsolete unused sessions.

706
00:30:09,746 --> 00:30:15,386 A:middle
There are also some changes
to configuration profiles.

707
00:30:15,786 --> 00:30:17,896 A:middle
There's a new payload to
configure an Ethernet proxy

708
00:30:18,726 --> 00:30:21,436 A:middle
and a number of settings
for other payloads,

709
00:30:21,436 --> 00:30:23,146 A:middle
including a handful
of restrictions

710
00:30:23,266 --> 00:30:25,296 A:middle
that were previously
available on iOS

711
00:30:25,296 --> 00:30:30,446 A:middle
and now also are
available on OS X.

712
00:30:30,476 --> 00:30:33,316 A:middle
As I alluded to earlier, there
are a lot of changes in VPN

713
00:30:33,316 --> 00:30:35,086 A:middle
and enterprise network
connectivity.

714
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:36,966 A:middle
I encourage you to come

715
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:38,676 A:middle
and checkout their
session Friday morning

716
00:30:38,676 --> 00:30:39,596 A:middle
and learn all about that.

717
00:30:40,096 --> 00:30:41,886 A:middle
I will not steal
their thunder here.

718
00:30:43,436 --> 00:30:46,276 A:middle
That brings us to the end
of the management section.

719
00:30:46,276 --> 00:30:48,146 A:middle
I would like to ask
Shruti to show you some

720
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:49,386 A:middle
of these features on iOS.

721
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:54,546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

722
00:30:55,046 --> 00:30:55,886 A:middle
>> SHRUTI GUPTA:
Thank you, Todd.

723
00:30:55,886 --> 00:30:56,646 A:middle
Hello again.

724
00:30:56,886 --> 00:31:00,306 A:middle
So I'm going to demo some of
the new features on iOS now.

725

726
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

727
00:30:56,886 --> 00:31:00,306 A:middle
So I'm going to demo some of
the new features on iOS now.

728
00:31:01,016 --> 00:31:05,036 A:middle
So here is my device
that is running iOS 9.

729
00:31:05,036 --> 00:31:09,216 A:middle
It is already enrolled in DEP.
If you look at the settings,

730
00:31:09,216 --> 00:31:12,206 A:middle
you can see that I can currently
set a passcode on this device.

731
00:31:12,726 --> 00:31:14,536 A:middle
I can change the wallpaper.

732
00:31:14,536 --> 00:31:18,936 A:middle
And if I go to General,
About, Name,

733
00:31:19,186 --> 00:31:21,466 A:middle
you can see that I can
edit the device name too.

734
00:31:21,466 --> 00:31:25,436 A:middle
Let's go to restrict these
settings using our MDM server.

735
00:31:26,046 --> 00:31:30,626 A:middle
So the server is now sending the
push notification to the device.

736
00:31:30,626 --> 00:31:33,746 A:middle
Keep your eyes on the screen
as the settings get updated.

737
00:31:34,316 --> 00:31:35,936 A:middle
There you go, you can see

738
00:31:36,256 --> 00:31:38,736 A:middle
that I can no longer set
a passcode on this device.

739
00:31:38,806 --> 00:31:40,636 A:middle
I cannot change the wallpaper.

740
00:31:40,926 --> 00:31:42,806 A:middle
If I try to tap on
the Name field,

741
00:31:42,806 --> 00:31:44,756 A:middle
I cannot change the
device name either.

742
00:31:46,136 --> 00:31:48,986 A:middle
Earlier we saw VPP
app assignment on Mac.

743
00:31:49,376 --> 00:31:53,736 A:middle
Now we are going to see VPP app
assignment on the iOS device.

744
00:31:53,736 --> 00:31:58,256 A:middle
I am going to push a
VPP app to this device,

745
00:31:58,256 --> 00:32:01,166 A:middle
which is going to be WWDC app.

746

747
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

748
00:31:58,256 --> 00:32:01,166 A:middle
which is going to be WWDC app.

749
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:03,686 A:middle
Let's confirm I'm not signed

750
00:32:03,686 --> 00:32:05,826 A:middle
into the App Store here
while it's pushing the app

751
00:32:05,826 --> 00:32:06,566 A:middle
from the server.

752
00:32:07,116 --> 00:32:08,476 A:middle
I go to App Store Settings,

753
00:32:08,546 --> 00:32:11,016 A:middle
you can see that I'm not
signed in with my Apple ID.

754
00:32:11,866 --> 00:32:15,076 A:middle
If you go to the Home
screen, you'll notice

755
00:32:15,076 --> 00:32:16,746 A:middle
that App Store does
not exist there.

756
00:32:16,746 --> 00:32:19,176 A:middle
That is because I
restricted the App Store

757
00:32:19,176 --> 00:32:20,846 A:middle
from installing apps
on this device.

758
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:23,696 A:middle
>> SHRUTI GUPTA: I guess
I'll give it back to Todd.

759
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:24,606 A:middle
Thank you.

760
00:32:25,516 --> 00:32:28,546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

761
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:29,696 A:middle
>> TODD FERNANDEZ:
Thank you, Shruti.

762
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,666 A:middle
You trust us, right?

763
00:32:31,696 --> 00:32:32,446 A:middle
It works great.

764
00:32:32,446 --> 00:32:33,846 A:middle
All right.

765
00:32:34,156 --> 00:32:35,966 A:middle
So what did Shruti
just show you?

766
00:32:35,966 --> 00:32:38,716 A:middle
Again taking advantage of
the three new restrictions

767
00:32:38,716 --> 00:32:41,666 A:middle
to prevent students and
others from changing things

768
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:43,406 A:middle
on the device that you
don't want them to change,

769
00:32:44,016 --> 00:32:47,766 A:middle
and being able to assign apps
to devices and install apps

770
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:50,126 A:middle
on devices even when the
App Store is disabled.

771
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:53,776 A:middle
So let's turn to
our fourth section

772
00:32:53,876 --> 00:32:55,616 A:middle
and talk a few minutes
about tools.

773
00:32:56,156 --> 00:32:59,156 A:middle
The first tools that
I want to highlight,

774
00:32:59,926 --> 00:33:01,776 A:middle
I hope that you MDM
develops are aware of.

775

776
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

777
00:32:59,926 --> 00:33:01,776 A:middle
I hope that you MDM
develops are aware of.

778
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,396 A:middle
If not, this is your moment.

779
00:33:03,836 --> 00:33:05,946 A:middle
We created over the
past year simulators

780
00:33:05,946 --> 00:33:07,686 A:middle
for both the Device
Enrollment Program

781
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:09,146 A:middle
and the Volume Purchase Program.

782
00:33:09,796 --> 00:33:11,406 A:middle
It allows you to
simulate large numbers

783
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,786 A:middle
of devices hitting
your server as well

784
00:33:13,786 --> 00:33:16,496 A:middle
as all the service errors that
may be difficult to simulate

785
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:18,766 A:middle
in any other way and
test your handling

786
00:33:18,766 --> 00:33:19,806 A:middle
to make sure it's robust.

787
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:22,506 A:middle
Both simulators are
available for download

788
00:33:22,506 --> 00:33:23,706 A:middle
on the Developer portal,

789
00:33:23,946 --> 00:33:25,686 A:middle
and we've released
new versions this week

790
00:33:25,686 --> 00:33:26,996 A:middle
that support all
the new features

791
00:33:26,996 --> 00:33:27,976 A:middle
that we talked about today.

792
00:33:28,686 --> 00:33:31,186 A:middle
Please, download and
use them to make sure

793
00:33:31,186 --> 00:33:35,226 A:middle
that your implementations
are as robust as they can be.

794
00:33:35,476 --> 00:33:37,806 A:middle
We use them to test our own
device management tools.

795
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:42,556 A:middle
For example, Profile
Manager, which, of course,

796
00:33:42,556 --> 00:33:44,596 A:middle
has been updated to support
all these new features.

797
00:33:44,676 --> 00:33:48,376 A:middle
Shruti showed you its support
for several of them today.

798
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:51,346 A:middle
Apple Configurator plays a role

799
00:33:51,346 --> 00:33:54,296 A:middle
in automated enrollment using
the Device Enrollment Program.

800
00:33:55,676 --> 00:33:57,636 A:middle
I want to talk about
Configurator.

801
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,746 A:middle
Here is Configurator.

802

803
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

804
00:34:00,486 --> 00:34:01,986 A:middle
Has the three workflows.

805
00:34:02,646 --> 00:34:04,836 A:middle
Prepare, you can configure
how the devices are prepared

806
00:34:04,836 --> 00:34:06,636 A:middle
and supervised, and assign them.

807
00:34:07,196 --> 00:34:10,956 A:middle
It was initially the only
way to supervise devices.

808
00:34:11,226 --> 00:34:13,676 A:middle
You can install VPP apps
using redemption codes.

809
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:14,866 A:middle
You can install profiles.

810
00:34:15,706 --> 00:34:17,446 A:middle
It maintains and
builds up a database

811
00:34:17,446 --> 00:34:20,496 A:middle
as you supervise
devices, and import apps

812
00:34:20,496 --> 00:34:22,606 A:middle
from iTunes, and
create profiles.

813
00:34:23,906 --> 00:34:26,505 A:middle
We received feedback
over the last three years

814
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:29,585 A:middle
and learned a lot about
managing iOS devices

815
00:34:29,585 --> 00:34:30,795 A:middle
over the last seven years.

816
00:34:31,485 --> 00:34:34,616 A:middle
I am thrilled to tell you we
have completely reinvented Apple

817
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:38,656 A:middle
Configurator and created
Apple Configurator 2.

818

[ Applause ]

819
00:34:44,045 --> 00:34:44,826 A:middle
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: So
what were our goals

820
00:34:44,826 --> 00:34:46,775 A:middle
in creating Apple
Configurator 2?

821
00:34:47,956 --> 00:34:50,235 A:middle
We wanted to invert
the user experience

822
00:34:50,406 --> 00:34:52,096 A:middle
and put your devices
front and center.

823
00:34:52,096 --> 00:34:54,496 A:middle
That's what you are looking at
in your cart or on your desk,

824
00:34:54,696 --> 00:34:57,106 A:middle
and show you the state
your devices are in,

825
00:34:57,106 --> 00:34:59,316 A:middle
which makes it easier for you
to understand what you can do

826
00:34:59,316 --> 00:35:00,536 A:middle
with them and what
is going to happen.

829
00:34:59,316 --> 00:35:00,536 A:middle
with them and what
is going to happen.

830
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:05,316 A:middle
We've broken apart the workflows
and given you discrete tasks

831
00:35:05,506 --> 00:35:07,596 A:middle
so you can perform
exactly what you need to do

832
00:35:07,596 --> 00:35:09,556 A:middle
on a specific group
of devices right now.

833
00:35:10,636 --> 00:35:13,286 A:middle
While at the same time
making it very easy

834
00:35:13,376 --> 00:35:16,986 A:middle
to combine those discrete
tasks into custom workflows

835
00:35:17,196 --> 00:35:18,486 A:middle
to prepare your devices

836
00:35:18,546 --> 00:35:21,436 A:middle
and manage them just the
way you want [applause].

837
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:26,576 A:middle
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: We
also heard that many

838
00:35:26,576 --> 00:35:28,486 A:middle
of you are using multiple
Configurator stations,

839
00:35:28,486 --> 00:35:30,536 A:middle
some even hundreds in a
large school district.

840
00:35:30,956 --> 00:35:34,326 A:middle
You want to better be able to
share data between the stations

841
00:35:34,326 --> 00:35:36,196 A:middle
and freely move devices
between them.

842
00:35:37,676 --> 00:35:41,096 A:middle
We also of course want Apple
Configurator to be a great tool

843

for managing a small
number of devices

844
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,616 A:middle
in a classroom, or
a cart, or a lab.

845
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,126 A:middle
But we also want it to
be a great companion

846
00:35:47,126 --> 00:35:49,826 A:middle
to the Device Enrollment
Program and an MDM server,

847
00:35:49,826 --> 00:35:51,776 A:middle
which is doing the bulk
of the remote management.

848
00:35:51,856 --> 00:35:53,726 A:middle
But you might want to
use Apple Configurator

849

for a few tasks here and there.

00:35:56,286 --> 00:35:58,146 A:middle
Instead of me talking
about it anymore,

851
00:35:58,146 --> 00:35:59,686 A:middle
I would like to invite
Enrique Osuna

>> ENRIQUE OSUNA: Thanks, Todd.

858
00:36:10,046 --> 00:36:11,356 A:middle
I'm excited to be
here to talk to you

859
00:36:11,356 --> 00:36:12,486 A:middle
about Apple Configurator 2.

860
00:36:12,486 --> 00:36:14,576 A:middle
Why don't we go ahead
and get started.

861
00:36:15,596 --> 00:36:17,536 A:middle
The first thing you'll see

862
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,186 A:middle
when you launch Apple
Configurator is the

863
00:36:19,186 --> 00:36:20,076 A:middle
Devices window.

864
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:23,566 A:middle
This Devices window has all
of your connected devices.

865
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:26,726 A:middle
Each of the connected devices
are represented by this icon.

866
00:36:27,256 --> 00:36:28,936 A:middle
These particular
icons have an image

867
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,026 A:middle
of the device's Home screen.

868
00:36:30,536 --> 00:36:31,546 A:middle
This is Configurator's way

869
00:36:31,546 --> 00:36:33,926 A:middle
to tell you these devices
have been prepared.

870
00:36:34,876 --> 00:36:37,826 A:middle
Everywhere in Configurator where
you see a collection of icons,

871
00:36:38,476 --> 00:36:40,286 A:middle
you can also view the
same data as a list.

872
00:36:40,996 --> 00:36:42,766 A:middle
You can get there by
clicking on the View button

873
00:36:42,766 --> 00:36:45,356 A:middle
in the toolbar and
clicking on List.

874
00:36:46,946 --> 00:36:48,806 A:middle
Here, you see the
same connected devices

875
00:36:49,236 --> 00:36:50,666 A:middle
with additional information.

876
00:36:51,826 --> 00:36:54,796 A:middle
To go back to the collection of
icons, click on the View button,

877
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,776 A:middle
and back to Collection.

878
00:36:58,036 --> 00:37:00,786 A:middle
One of the key features that
Todd mentioned was the ability

881
00:36:58,036 --> 00:37:00,786 A:middle
One of the key features that
Todd mentioned was the ability

882
00:37:00,786 --> 00:37:03,616 A:middle
to perform discrete tasks
on connected devices.

883
00:37:04,386 --> 00:37:06,446 A:middle
These tasks are found
in the Actions menu.

884
00:37:07,356 --> 00:37:10,796 A:middle
In the Actions menu you can
do things like add, remove,

885
00:37:10,796 --> 00:37:15,026 A:middle
modify existing content as well
as back up and prepare devices.

886
00:37:15,576 --> 00:37:17,716 A:middle
We will talk more about
prepare in a second.

887
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:21,926 A:middle
In the Devices window you
see a big toolbar at the top.

888
00:37:22,276 --> 00:37:24,996 A:middle
The toolbar has all of the
common actions of Configurator,

889
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:26,766 A:middle
such as the Update button here.

890
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,796 A:middle
In the upper right-hand corner

891
00:37:29,796 --> 00:37:32,436 A:middle
of these connected devices
you see this big red badge.

892
00:37:33,006 --> 00:37:34,806 A:middle
What this red badge indicates is

893
00:37:34,806 --> 00:37:36,296 A:middle
that these devices
require an update.

894
00:37:37,206 --> 00:37:39,326 A:middle
I'll go ahead and see what
updates are available.

895
00:37:39,416 --> 00:37:40,686 A:middle
Let me select all my devices.

896
00:37:43,156 --> 00:37:44,836 A:middle
Click on the Update
button in the toolbar.

897
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:48,876 A:middle
Now what Configurator is doing
is contacting the iTunes Store,

898
00:37:49,886 --> 00:37:52,816 A:middle
figuring out if there's
any iOS or app updates.

899
00:37:53,286 --> 00:37:55,326 A:middle
Now, you can see that
Configurator has identified

900
00:37:55,326 --> 00:37:58,576 A:middle
that the WWDC app on my
devices need an update.

901
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:01,526 A:middle
So I can update that app by
clicking the Update button.

904
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:01,526 A:middle
So I can update that app by
clicking the Update button.

905
00:38:02,596 --> 00:38:07,806 A:middle
Configurator is contacting the
Store, downloading the apps,

906
00:38:07,806 --> 00:38:09,576 A:middle
and actually installing
them onto the devices.

907
00:38:10,226 --> 00:38:13,416 A:middle
For those who didn't notice,
I didn't have to launch iTunes

908
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,646 A:middle
in this entire transaction.

>> ENRIQUE OSUNA: Configurator
no longer has a database of apps

911
00:38:23,026 --> 00:38:24,296 A:middle
that you have to
manage or maintain.

912
00:38:24,296 --> 00:38:28,206 A:middle
Now, as Configurator is
finishing up the app install,

913
00:38:28,436 --> 00:38:30,876 A:middle
you'll notice the big
red badge that was

914
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:33,546 A:middle
in the upper right-hand corner
should start disappearing

915
00:38:33,546 --> 00:38:34,126 A:middle
here shortly.

916
00:38:35,226 --> 00:38:37,666 A:middle
This is an indicator that
these devices no longer require

917
00:38:37,666 --> 00:38:37,956 A:middle
an update.

918
00:38:46,046 --> 00:38:48,506 A:middle
Now, right before
this presentation,

919
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:50,986 A:middle
I was actually having some
problems on one of my pads.

920
00:38:50,986 --> 00:38:54,106 A:middle
It was probably that one, trying
to get on to the WiFi network.

921
00:38:54,596 --> 00:38:57,296 A:middle
Let's look at what
might be going on.

922
00:38:57,296 --> 00:38:59,636 A:middle
If I double-click on
one of these devices,

923
00:38:59,896 --> 00:39:03,396 A:middle
Configurator launches you into
this new UI that allows you

926
00:38:59,896 --> 00:39:03,396 A:middle
Configurator launches you into
this new UI that allows you

927
00:39:03,396 --> 00:39:05,126 A:middle
to see some information
about your device.

928
00:39:05,606 --> 00:39:08,816 A:middle
You can find things like the
device's name, serial number,

929
00:39:08,886 --> 00:39:10,916 A:middle
as well as organization
information.

930
00:39:11,646 --> 00:39:14,156 A:middle
In the left sidebar,
you can find apps.

931
00:39:14,626 --> 00:39:16,266 A:middle
These are the apps
actually installed

932
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:18,896 A:middle
on my device, as
well as profiles.

933
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:22,156 A:middle
These are the profiles that
are installed on my device.

934
00:39:22,696 --> 00:39:25,596 A:middle
Unfortunately, this device
is missing my WiFi profile.

935
00:39:25,776 --> 00:39:28,116 A:middle
I'm sure I have other
devices in my cart

936
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,116 A:middle
that are missing
a profile as well.

937
00:39:30,116 --> 00:39:32,276 A:middle
Let's go ahead and see if
we can't figure it out.

938
00:39:32,276 --> 00:39:35,416 A:middle
I can go back to all
my devices by clicking

939
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:36,716 A:middle
on the Back button
in the toolbar.

940
00:39:37,896 --> 00:39:39,166 A:middle
Here are my connected devices.

941
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:42,216 A:middle
If I go to the Search field
in the upper right-hand corner

942
00:39:43,396 --> 00:39:44,836 A:middle
and start typing WiFi,

943
00:39:47,896 --> 00:39:50,716 A:middle
Configurator offers me
this fancy suggestion

944
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:54,306 A:middle
of all the devices that have
the WiFi profile installed.

945
00:39:54,306 --> 00:39:56,746 A:middle
The problem that I have is not

946
00:39:56,746 --> 00:39:58,786 A:middle
which devices have the
profile already installed.

947
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:01,126 A:middle
It's the devices that don't
have the profile installed.

It's the devices that don't

If I click on the token
in the Search field

and it says profile
is not installed,

953
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:09,996 A:middle
Configurator will show me the
two pads missing the profile.

954
00:40:10,356 --> 00:40:11,886 A:middle
Let me fix the problem.

955
00:40:12,296 --> 00:40:15,896 A:middle
I'll select both devices,
click on the Add button

956
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:18,516 A:middle
in the toolbar, and
click on Profiles.

957
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:23,546 A:middle
Configurator 2 no longer
has a database of profiles.

958
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,426 A:middle
These profiles can be found
anywhere on your disk.

959
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:28,536 A:middle
Let's navigate to the desktop.

960
00:40:28,946 --> 00:40:30,846 A:middle
Here I have my WiFi profile.

961
00:40:31,206 --> 00:40:35,876 A:middle
What is neat, you can have these
profiles on mounted volumes

962
00:40:35,876 --> 00:40:37,166 A:middle
and even in your iCloud drive.

963
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:41,846 A:middle
Now that Configurator is done,
I can clear the Search field

964
00:40:42,236 --> 00:40:43,796 A:middle
and I can see my
connected devices again.

965
00:40:44,256 --> 00:40:46,186 A:middle
Another cool feature

966
00:40:46,186 --> 00:40:49,166 A:middle
of Configurator 2 is the
ability to tag a device.

967
00:40:49,546 --> 00:40:53,286 A:middle
Tagging a device allows you to
create device groups, but again,

968
00:40:53,286 --> 00:40:55,096 A:middle
without a database of devices.

969
00:40:55,096 --> 00:40:56,796 A:middle
I can show you that right now.

devices, go to the toolbar,

If I select a couple of these
devices, go to the toolbar,

974
00:41:01,006 --> 00:41:04,726 A:middle
and click on the Tag button
and select a few of these tags.

975
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:07,376 A:middle
Press the Return key.

976
00:41:08,036 --> 00:41:09,676 A:middle
What Configurator
is doing is writing

977
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:10,966 A:middle
that tag to these devices.

978
00:41:11,486 --> 00:41:13,096 A:middle
What is neat about the tags,

979
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:15,606 A:middle
it is actually written
to the device.

980
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:18,696 A:middle
When you transport this device
to another Configurator station,

981
00:41:19,046 --> 00:41:20,836 A:middle
those same tags appear
there as well.

982
00:41:22,336 --> 00:41:24,126 A:middle
If I go back to the
same Search field

983
00:41:24,126 --> 00:41:26,626 A:middle
in the upper right-hand corner
and start looking for my tag,

984
00:41:28,146 --> 00:41:30,166 A:middle
I start getting a
suggestion, fourth grade,

985
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:31,436 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead
and click on that.

986
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:35,636 A:middle
Now Configurator is
showing me just the pads

987
00:41:35,636 --> 00:41:37,416 A:middle
that are tagged with
fourth grade.

there's a Save button.

Like Configurator 1,

00:42:21,126 --> 00:42:23,806 A:middle
Configurator 2 can
rename your devices.

to provide static text.

00:42:34,936 --> 00:42:37,886 A:middle
that allowed you to append
an autoincrementing number

1012
00:42:37,886 --> 00:42:38,756 A:middle
to the field.

1013
00:42:39,336 --> 00:42:41,716 A:middle
In Configurator 2, we kind
of let you do that too,

1014
00:42:41,716 --> 00:42:44,946 A:middle
but we do that through what
we like to call a token.

1015
00:42:45,136 --> 00:42:49,306 A:middle
These tokens can be put
anywhere in the name.

1016
00:42:49,986 --> 00:42:52,056 A:middle
Here you see the
autoincrementing number.

1017
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:54,766 A:middle
You see other information
about the device,

1018
00:42:54,766 --> 00:42:59,446 A:middle
like the device's serial
number, type, and capacity.

1019

1020
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1021
00:43:00,176 --> 00:43:02,316 A:middle
For this demonstration,
I like to use type

1022
00:43:03,746 --> 00:43:05,046 A:middle
and the autoincrementing number.

1023
00:43:06,396 --> 00:43:07,456 A:middle
Now I click on Rename.

1024
00:43:07,936 --> 00:43:11,316 A:middle
Configurator is now going
through all these devices,

1025
00:43:11,846 --> 00:43:14,326 A:middle
grabbing those bits of
information off the devic,

1026
00:43:14,796 --> 00:43:17,226 A:middle
and creating a name and putting
it back on to the device.

1027
00:43:17,656 --> 00:43:21,126 A:middle
As you can see, my devices are
named Townships Schools iPad 1

1028
00:43:21,126 --> 00:43:23,336 A:middle
through 5.

1029
00:43:23,336 --> 00:43:24,646 A:middle
All these devices
are configured.

1030
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:31,226 A:middle
I have a brand-new cart of
devices I would like to add.

1031
00:43:31,226 --> 00:43:35,106 A:middle
These are pads that are right
out of the box and almost ready

1032
00:43:35,106 --> 00:43:36,806 A:middle
to go as soon as
Configurator is done with them.

1033
00:43:37,436 --> 00:43:39,926 A:middle
The first thing that you'll
notice is this big white Device

1034
00:43:39,966 --> 00:43:42,606 A:middle
icon, what that represents is

1035
00:43:42,606 --> 00:43:44,656 A:middle
that these devices are
ready to be prepared.

1036
00:43:44,716 --> 00:43:47,226 A:middle
I would like to show you
that prepare right now.

1037
00:43:47,686 --> 00:43:49,436 A:middle
Let me click on one
of these devices.

1038
00:43:51,066 --> 00:43:52,686 A:middle
Click on the Prepare
button in the toolbar.

1039
00:43:53,596 --> 00:43:55,876 A:middle
In Configurator 2, there's
two prepare workflows.

1040
00:43:56,226 --> 00:43:59,166 A:middle
One is manual, and the other
is the automated enrollment

1041
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:01,656 A:middle
that Todd talked about
earlier in the presentation.

1042

1043
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1044
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:01,656 A:middle
that Todd talked about
earlier in the presentation.

1045
00:44:02,676 --> 00:44:04,056 A:middle
For this demonstration,

1046
00:44:04,056 --> 00:44:07,416 A:middle
I'm going to do these
iPads using manual.

1047
00:44:07,636 --> 00:44:08,646 A:middle
I'll click on Next.

1048
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:10,916 A:middle
Here is my opportunity

1049
00:44:10,916 --> 00:44:13,166 A:middle
to manually enroll
the devices into MDM.

1050
00:44:13,596 --> 00:44:15,306 A:middle
I don't have an MDM
server with me today,

1051
00:44:15,306 --> 00:44:16,636 A:middle
so I will go ahead
and click on Next.

1052
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:19,626 A:middle
Here, Configurator is
asking me if I want

1053
00:44:19,626 --> 00:44:21,676 A:middle
to supervise my devices
to my organization,

1054
00:44:21,676 --> 00:44:23,706 A:middle
and I absolutely do
to take advantage

1055
00:44:23,706 --> 00:44:26,126 A:middle
of the new iOS 9
supervise only features.

1056
00:44:26,696 --> 00:44:27,386 A:middle
Click on Next.

1057
00:44:28,336 --> 00:44:31,656 A:middle
This is the organization that is
associated with the supervision.

1058
00:44:32,226 --> 00:44:32,806 A:middle
This looks good.

1059
00:44:32,806 --> 00:44:37,436 A:middle
Next. And this final
pane is my opportunity

1060
00:44:37,436 --> 00:44:39,716 A:middle
of skipping iOS Setup
Assistant panes

1061
00:44:39,986 --> 00:44:42,426 A:middle
on the device once I hand
my device back to my users.

1062
00:44:42,866 --> 00:44:46,676 A:middle
For this demonstration, I want
to not show any of the panes.

1063
00:44:46,676 --> 00:44:48,456 A:middle
I'll go ahead and
click on Prepare.

1064
00:44:48,866 --> 00:44:51,526 A:middle
Configurator is now preparing
and supervising these devices.

1065
00:44:51,956 --> 00:44:55,196 A:middle
I still have to tag, add some
profiles, and add some apps

1066
00:44:55,246 --> 00:44:59,106 A:middle
to this device, which
actually is a lengthy process.

1067
00:44:59,526 --> 00:45:02,426 A:middle
So, what we did in Configurator
2 is automated this process

1068

1069
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1070
00:44:59,526 --> 00:45:02,426 A:middle
So, what we did in Configurator
2 is automated this process

1071
00:45:02,426 --> 00:45:04,186 A:middle
with what we call blueprints.

1072
00:45:04,516 --> 00:45:06,086 A:middle
I'll show you what a
blueprint is right now.

1073
00:45:06,736 --> 00:45:08,846 A:middle
If I click on the Apply
button in the toolbar,

1074
00:45:08,846 --> 00:45:11,816 A:middle
and click on Edit Blueprints,
Configurator takes you

1075
00:45:11,816 --> 00:45:14,576 A:middle
into this special mode where
you can create a new blueprint,

1076
00:45:14,996 --> 00:45:16,296 A:middle
and I'm going to do that.

1077
00:45:16,486 --> 00:45:17,866 A:middle
Click New Blueprint.

1078
00:45:18,436 --> 00:45:19,966 A:middle
Let me give it a
name I can remember.

1079
00:45:26,016 --> 00:45:27,036 A:middle
And press Return.

1080
00:45:27,926 --> 00:45:30,196 A:middle
Now, what's really cool
about these blueprints is

1081
00:45:30,196 --> 00:45:31,796 A:middle
that they act just
like a device.

1082
00:45:32,126 --> 00:45:34,706 A:middle
Anything that I can do
on a connected device,

1083
00:45:34,706 --> 00:45:36,106 A:middle
I can actually do
on a blueprint.

1084
00:45:36,436 --> 00:45:39,786 A:middle
What the blueprint does,
it records those actions,

1085
00:45:39,786 --> 00:45:41,866 A:middle
and then later on I can
replay those actions.

1086
00:45:42,226 --> 00:45:44,776 A:middle
Let me do the first
thing, which is prepare.

1087
00:45:45,226 --> 00:45:46,286 A:middle
If I click on the blueprint,

1088
00:45:46,986 --> 00:45:48,746 A:middle
I press on the Prepare
button in the toolbar.

1089
00:45:49,536 --> 00:45:52,156 A:middle
Configurator offers me the
same view we had earlier

1090
00:45:52,156 --> 00:45:53,406 A:middle
when we clicked Prepare.

1091
00:45:53,556 --> 00:45:55,426 A:middle
Configurator remembered
my last options.

1092
00:45:55,496 --> 00:45:57,816 A:middle
And these options are fine.

1093
00:45:57,816 --> 00:46:00,606 A:middle
I am breeze through
these setup panes.

1094

1095
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1096
00:45:57,816 --> 00:46:00,606 A:middle
I am breeze through
these setup panes.

1097
00:46:01,846 --> 00:46:03,326 A:middle
Click on Next.

1098
00:46:04,056 --> 00:46:05,336 A:middle
Until we get to prepare.

1099
00:46:05,336 --> 00:46:09,346 A:middle
Now that the blueprint
is prepared,

1100
00:46:09,346 --> 00:46:11,086 A:middle
I want to add some tags.

1101
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:13,926 A:middle
Click on the Tag
button in the toolbar.

1102
00:46:14,936 --> 00:46:16,136 A:middle
Select a couple of tags.

1103
00:46:16,796 --> 00:46:17,356 A:middle
Press Return.

1104
00:46:18,136 --> 00:46:21,166 A:middle
You will immediately notice
the Blueprints label is updated

1105
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:22,236 A:middle
with my new tags.

1106
00:46:23,996 --> 00:46:25,276 A:middle
I want to add an app.

1107
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,856 A:middle
Click the add button
in the toolbar.

1108
00:46:28,816 --> 00:46:33,276 A:middle
Apps. Now what you see here
is all the VPP apps associated

1109
00:46:33,276 --> 00:46:34,416 A:middle
with my VPP account.

1110
00:46:34,906 --> 00:46:37,866 A:middle
I want to go ahead
and push the WWDC app

1111
00:46:37,986 --> 00:46:39,906 A:middle
to a part of this blueprint.

1112
00:46:39,906 --> 00:46:46,076 A:middle
I click on WWDC, Add Apps,
and then finally I want

1113
00:46:46,076 --> 00:46:47,296 A:middle
to add my WiFi profile.

1114
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:50,136 A:middle
The same Add button, Profiles,

1115
00:46:51,096 --> 00:46:54,416 A:middle
Configurator remembered the
last spot I was at for profile.

1116
00:46:54,416 --> 00:46:58,236 A:middle
I'll click on my WiFi profile.

1117
00:46:59,076 --> 00:47:01,066 A:middle
Add profiles.

1118

1119
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1120
00:46:59,076 --> 00:47:01,066 A:middle
Add profiles.

1121
00:47:01,066 --> 00:47:02,326 A:middle
Now, like inspecting the device,

1122
00:47:02,326 --> 00:47:03,566 A:middle
you can also inspect
a blueprint.

1123
00:47:03,566 --> 00:47:06,476 A:middle
If I double-click on this
blueprint, I'm presented

1124
00:47:06,476 --> 00:47:08,526 A:middle
with this blueprint inspector.

1125
00:47:08,886 --> 00:47:11,566 A:middle
Here you can see additional
information about the blueprint

1126
00:47:11,796 --> 00:47:15,296 A:middle
such as its name, its
storage requirements,

1127
00:47:16,016 --> 00:47:19,086 A:middle
here with the storage bar at
the top of this inspector,

1128
00:47:19,486 --> 00:47:22,056 A:middle
as well as the prepare
options I highlighted earlier

1129
00:47:22,056 --> 00:47:23,726 A:middle
and the tags that I've set.

1130
00:47:24,416 --> 00:47:28,096 A:middle
Like a device inspector, you can
also inspect the apps associated

1131
00:47:28,096 --> 00:47:31,196 A:middle
with this blueprint and
the profiles associated

1132
00:47:31,196 --> 00:47:31,766 A:middle
with this blueprint.

1133
00:47:33,386 --> 00:47:34,226 A:middle
Now I'm almost done.

1134
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:37,006 A:middle
I just need to rename
the devices associated

1135
00:47:37,006 --> 00:47:37,586 A:middle
with this blueprint.

1136
00:47:37,586 --> 00:47:38,606 A:middle
So I go back to Info.

1137
00:47:40,196 --> 00:47:41,206 A:middle
Click on Actions.

1138
00:47:42,596 --> 00:47:45,336 A:middle
Modify. Device Name.

1139
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:48,466 A:middle
Configurator remembered
my last rename options.

1140
00:47:48,876 --> 00:47:51,266 A:middle
Those worked fine, so
I'll click on Rename.

1141
00:47:51,676 --> 00:47:55,526 A:middle
You notice here in the blueprint
the device name options show

1142
00:47:55,526 --> 00:47:55,896 A:middle
up here.

1143
00:47:56,616 --> 00:47:57,626 A:middle
Great, this blueprint is done.

1144
00:47:57,626 --> 00:48:00,816 A:middle
In the lower right-hand corner,
I can click on the Done button.

1145

1146
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1147
00:47:57,626 --> 00:48:00,816 A:middle
In the lower right-hand corner,
I can click on the Done button.

1148
00:48:03,096 --> 00:48:05,786 A:middle
Now I want to apply that
blueprint to these devices

1149
00:48:05,786 --> 00:48:07,036 A:middle
that are ready to be prepared.

1150
00:48:07,036 --> 00:48:08,516 A:middle
Let me select those devices.

1151
00:48:10,126 --> 00:48:12,756 A:middle
Go back to that same Apply
button that we went to earlier.

1152
00:48:13,456 --> 00:48:15,176 A:middle
Now you see an entry
for my blueprint.

1153
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,906 A:middle
If I tap on that entry,
Configurator is now going

1154
00:48:18,906 --> 00:48:21,006 A:middle
through the actions I
saved in that blueprint

1155
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:22,736 A:middle
and replaying them
on to the devices.

1156
00:48:23,276 --> 00:48:24,766 A:middle
This is Apple Configurator 2.

1157
00:48:25,056 --> 00:48:25,806 A:middle
Thank you very much.

1158
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:26,926 A:middle
Back to Todd.

1159
00:48:27,516 --> 00:48:34,546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

1160
00:48:35,046 --> 00:48:35,956 A:middle
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: Thank
you very much, Enrique.

1161
00:48:36,936 --> 00:48:38,516 A:middle
So Enrique has showed you how

1162
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:40,656 A:middle
to configure devices using
Apple Configurator 2,

1163
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,676 A:middle
including installing VPP apps.

1164
00:48:43,376 --> 00:48:44,866 A:middle
I'll talk more about
that in a moment.

1165
00:48:45,386 --> 00:48:48,006 A:middle
You can create device tags
that travel with the devices

1166
00:48:48,006 --> 00:48:50,646 A:middle
between multiple Configurator
stations using tags.

1167
00:48:51,516 --> 00:48:54,856 A:middle
He showed you how to
build and use a blueprint

1168
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:59,046 A:middle
to create a custom workflow
and replay the set of actions

1169
00:48:59,176 --> 00:49:03,966 A:middle
that you want on any
number of further devices.

1170

1171
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

1172
00:48:59,176 --> 00:49:03,966 A:middle
that you want on any
number of further devices.

1173
00:49:04,046 --> 00:49:05,506 A:middle
However, there's even
more automation options

1174
00:49:05,506 --> 00:49:06,556 A:middle
that we didn't show you here.

1175
00:49:07,046 --> 00:49:08,846 A:middle
In addition to blueprints
in the UI,

1176
00:49:09,486 --> 00:49:10,936 A:middle
there's also a command-line
tool.

1177
00:49:11,396 --> 00:49:14,196 A:middle
There's a scripting library

>> TODD FERNANDEZ:
You're in for a treat

1182
00:49:22,666 --> 00:49:25,106 A:middle
because Sal Soghoian is
going to talk about that

1183
00:49:25,106 --> 00:49:27,156 A:middle
on Thursday afternoon,
how to use Automator

1184
00:49:27,156 --> 00:49:28,326 A:middle
and Configurator together

1185
00:49:28,326 --> 00:49:30,386 A:middle
to automate your device
management workflows.

1186
00:49:31,766 --> 00:49:34,416 A:middle
Enrique showed you a lot of
what Apple Configurator 2 can do

1187
00:49:34,536 --> 00:49:35,426 A:middle
but there's more.

1188
00:49:36,636 --> 00:49:40,926 A:middle
I mentioned multiple station
support, all of those profiles

1189
00:49:40,926 --> 00:49:44,246 A:middle
that you can find anywhere on
your Mac can be saved in iCloud

1190
00:49:44,246 --> 00:49:46,496 A:middle
in addition to other
Configurator settings.

1191
00:49:47,286 --> 00:49:48,836 A:middle
I mentioned the automation
tools.

1192
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:52,476 A:middle
While Enrique showed you the
cool additions to renaming

1193
00:49:52,776 --> 00:49:54,396 A:middle
that Apple Configurator 2 has,

1194
00:49:54,736 --> 00:49:56,366 A:middle
there are also some great
enhancements to being able

1195
00:49:56,366 --> 00:49:58,866 A:middle
to set wallpaper, which
is no longer a preference,

1196
00:49:58,956 --> 00:50:01,326 A:middle
but can be done as a command
on any number of devices.

but can be done as a command
on any number of devices.

1200
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:03,776 A:middle
There are cool tricks
if you look

1201
00:50:03,776 --> 00:50:04,976 A:middle
at the options in there as well.

1202
00:50:06,296 --> 00:50:07,566 A:middle
Definitely check it out.

1203
00:50:07,566 --> 00:50:10,906 A:middle
We released the beta yesterday,
and it's available for you

1204
00:50:10,906 --> 00:50:12,436 A:middle
to download from
the Developer portal

1205
00:50:12,436 --> 00:50:13,946 A:middle
and we will also
have it in the Lab.

1206
00:50:14,526 --> 00:50:17,906 A:middle
That brings us to the end
of our fourth section.

1207
00:50:19,636 --> 00:50:22,116 A:middle
And I just want to sum up
quickly for you administrators

1208
00:50:22,276 --> 00:50:24,476 A:middle
that if you are using
wireless remote management,

1209
00:50:24,476 --> 00:50:25,906 A:middle
use the Device Enrollment
Program

1210
00:50:25,906 --> 00:50:28,456 A:middle
or Configurator using
automated enrollment

1211
00:50:28,596 --> 00:50:31,666 A:middle
to get your devices enrolled
in MDM or use Configurator

1212
00:50:31,776 --> 00:50:34,306 A:middle
to manage your devices if
you are not going to use MDM.

1213
00:50:35,236 --> 00:50:37,716 A:middle
You can use VPP managed
distribution now not only

1214
00:50:37,716 --> 00:50:40,926 A:middle
to distribute apps to
users but also to devices.

1215
00:50:41,796 --> 00:50:44,346 A:middle
As I mentioned the Configurator
2 beta is available now.

1216
00:50:45,586 --> 00:50:48,236 A:middle
Turning to developers,
again, you app developers,

1217
00:50:48,236 --> 00:50:51,276 A:middle
please early next month in
iTunes Connect you will be able

1218
00:50:51,276 --> 00:50:53,346 A:middle
to opt in to device
assignments for your apps.

1219
00:50:54,256 --> 00:50:57,776 A:middle
