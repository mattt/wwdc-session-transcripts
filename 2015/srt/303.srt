00:00:21,046 --> 00:00:21,426 A:middle
>> TRYSTAN KOSMYNKA: Thank you.

2
00:00:21,926 --> 00:00:22,266 A:middle
Thank you.

3
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,566 A:middle
My name is Trystan Kosmynka.

4
00:00:26,686 --> 00:00:27,826 A:middle
I'm in iTunes Engineering.

5
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:31,416 A:middle
Myself and my colleague David
Hopkins are excited today

6
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,596 A:middle
to help you get the most
out of App Analytics.

7
00:00:34,176 --> 00:00:39,296 A:middle
App Analytics today is publicly
available for all developers

8
00:00:39,296 --> 00:00:40,726 A:middle
with a valid developer account.

9
00:00:41,596 --> 00:00:44,356 A:middle
Sales admin or finance
role inside iTunes Connect.

10
00:00:44,906 --> 00:00:47,326 A:middle
There are no restrictions to
your use of App Analytics.

11
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:49,096 A:middle
It's available to
all developers.

12
00:00:49,686 --> 00:00:51,716 A:middle
Because there are
no restrictions

13
00:00:51,716 --> 00:00:55,266 A:middle
and it's publicly available, we
are excited to tell you that as

14
00:00:55,266 --> 00:00:57,356 A:middle
of today it is no
longer in beta.

15
00:00:58,121 --> 00:01:00,121 A:middle
[Applause]

16

17
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

18
00:00:58,121 --> 00:01:00,121 A:middle
[Applause]

19
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:04,025 A:middle
Thanks. So why does this matter?

20
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:05,566 A:middle
Why do we care about
App Analytics?

21
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,996 A:middle
Why is Apple excited to
bring this product to you?

22
00:01:08,616 --> 00:01:11,276 A:middle
We care because App
Analytics provides answers.

23
00:01:11,536 --> 00:01:13,446 A:middle
There are a lot of big
questions that you have

24
00:01:13,446 --> 00:01:14,856 A:middle
as app developers or marketers.

25
00:01:15,856 --> 00:01:17,026 A:middle
Are customers finding your app?

26
00:01:17,026 --> 00:01:18,676 A:middle
Are they installing the app?

27
00:01:19,186 --> 00:01:21,536 A:middle
Are they purchasing goods
inside of your application,

28
00:01:21,536 --> 00:01:22,266 A:middle
and are they returning?

29
00:01:23,076 --> 00:01:25,166 A:middle
Our goal with App Analytics
is that we can provide some

30
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,766 A:middle
of these insights so you
can make great decisions

31
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:28,426 A:middle
going forward.

32
00:01:29,876 --> 00:01:33,466 A:middle
Through these answers, we also
reveal missed opportunities.

33
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:37,716 A:middle
A good example of this is if
your application is available

34
00:01:37,716 --> 00:01:40,696 A:middle
across all storefronts but
you have not yet localized

35
00:01:40,696 --> 00:01:41,686 A:middle
in a particular country,

36
00:01:42,216 --> 00:01:44,466 A:middle
with App Analytics what
you can see is you can see

37
00:01:44,466 --> 00:01:46,826 A:middle
that you have really
high App Store page views

38
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:50,046 A:middle
in a particular country but the
conversion rate isn't so good.

39
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:53,246 A:middle
If you maybe localize your
store presence to that language,

40
00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:55,516 A:middle
you make it more
accessible to more customers.

41
00:01:55,766 --> 00:02:00,796 A:middle
This is the type of data that
we deliver with App Analytics.

42

43
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

44
00:01:55,766 --> 00:02:00,796 A:middle
This is the type of data that
we deliver with App Analytics.

45
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:03,006 A:middle
With all of these,
our ultimate goal is

46
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:04,126 A:middle
to help you build a better app.

47
00:02:04,946 --> 00:02:07,776 A:middle
You are here to learn tips
and tricks from experts

48
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:10,286 A:middle
so you can build a better app.

49
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:11,516 A:middle
That's on the development cycle.

50
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:14,886 A:middle
We want you to know that your
responsibilities do not stop

51
00:02:15,406 --> 00:02:16,296 A:middle
after launch.

52
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,416 A:middle
There is a whole new set
of things to focus on,

53
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:22,606 A:middle
marketing your app, advertising
your app, adding more content,

54
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:26,026 A:middle
new versions, maybe
there's price changes.

55
00:02:26,716 --> 00:02:28,286 A:middle
Your Store presence
is important as well.

56
00:02:28,686 --> 00:02:31,476 A:middle
All of that goes back into your
product development life cycle,

57
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:35,356 A:middle
and it's really important
to creating a successful app

58
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:38,036 A:middle
in a successful app business.

59
00:02:38,156 --> 00:02:41,006 A:middle
We do all of these things
with Analytics data.

60
00:02:41,526 --> 00:02:43,626 A:middle
Analytics has three
key data sources.

61
00:02:44,036 --> 00:02:49,606 A:middle
We have App Store data,
sales data, and usage data.

62
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:54,306 A:middle
These three data sources are
combined to tell a single story

63
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:56,046 A:middle
across acquisition
to engagement.

64
00:02:56,386 --> 00:02:57,976 A:middle
We answer those key
questions with this.

65
00:02:58,246 --> 00:03:00,886 A:middle
Are customers finding your
app, are they purchasing it,

66

67
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

68
00:02:58,246 --> 00:03:00,886 A:middle
Are customers finding your
app, are they purchasing it,

69
00:03:00,886 --> 00:03:01,966 A:middle
and are they using
it and returning?

70
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:04,346 A:middle
To understand these
measures better,

71
00:03:04,596 --> 00:03:06,536 A:middle
let's take Trip Guider 2.0.

72
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,056 A:middle
We updated this this
year for WWDC.

73
00:03:10,516 --> 00:03:11,366 A:middle
Don't download it.

74
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:12,866 A:middle
It is not real.

75
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:15,016 A:middle
Here we are seeing
our App Store views.

76
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,806 A:middle
What App Store views are is a
potential customer visits your

77
00:03:19,806 --> 00:03:21,286 A:middle
product page in the App Store.

78
00:03:21,656 --> 00:03:22,806 A:middle
That triggers an App Store view.

79
00:03:22,806 --> 00:03:24,366 A:middle
This is an example
of our Store measure.

80
00:03:25,716 --> 00:03:28,496 A:middle
Next ,we have app
units and app sales.

81
00:03:28,996 --> 00:03:32,106 A:middle
This is an example of
our sales measures.

82
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:34,926 A:middle
In this example, I have
$2.99 for Trip Guider.

83
00:03:34,926 --> 00:03:36,966 A:middle
That's going to generate
$2.99 of sales.

84
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,046 A:middle
This is what the customer
spent on your app.

85
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:43,156 A:middle
App units registers
the transaction,

86
00:03:43,226 --> 00:03:46,506 A:middle
a single app unit would
be present in this case.

87
00:03:47,456 --> 00:03:49,216 A:middle
Let's move along to
the usage measures.

88
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,196 A:middle
We have installations.

89
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:54,126 A:middle
Installations is
different than app units.

90
00:03:54,126 --> 00:03:55,286 A:middle
This is a common
question we get:

91
00:03:55,286 --> 00:03:56,596 A:middle
What is the difference
between these two?

92
00:03:57,176 --> 00:04:00,496 A:middle
If I was to purchase Trip Guider
for $2.99, that's one app unit,

93

94
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

95
00:03:57,176 --> 00:04:00,496 A:middle
If I was to purchase Trip Guider
for $2.99, that's one app unit,

96
00:04:00,846 --> 00:04:02,596 A:middle
but it may generate
multiple installs.

97
00:04:02,596 --> 00:04:03,196 A:middle
It's one to many.

98
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:05,276 A:middle
I could have purchased
it and installed it

99
00:04:05,276 --> 00:04:06,526 A:middle
on my iPhone and my iPad.

100
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,686 A:middle
That generates two
installations.

101
00:04:10,236 --> 00:04:13,356 A:middle
Additional usage measures that
we have available: sessions,

102
00:04:13,526 --> 00:04:16,916 A:middle
active devices, and active
devices in the last 30 days.

103
00:04:17,505 --> 00:04:20,435 A:middle
What is important with these is
that it is again one to many.

104
00:04:20,555 --> 00:04:22,316 A:middle
I may have opened
this app, Trip Guider,

105
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:24,646 A:middle
and visited Pigeon
Point in the morning.

106
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:25,516 A:middle
That's one session.

107
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,736 A:middle
I came home and shared
the experience

108
00:04:27,736 --> 00:04:28,606 A:middle
with family and friends.

109
00:04:28,956 --> 00:04:29,866 A:middle
That's two sessions.

110
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:31,296 A:middle
But all of this was
from my iPhone,

111
00:04:31,296 --> 00:04:32,826 A:middle
and that's one active device.

112
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,416 A:middle
So sessions is an overall
idea of engagement,

113
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:38,466 A:middle
and active devices is, how
large is your device base?

114
00:04:38,906 --> 00:04:42,096 A:middle
Active devices in the
last 30 days is the same

115
00:04:42,096 --> 00:04:45,556 A:middle
as active devices; however,
the time period is longer.

116
00:04:45,846 --> 00:04:47,636 A:middle
I'm not using Trip
Guider every single day.

117
00:04:48,016 --> 00:04:50,486 A:middle
But if I used it in the
last 30 days, I register a 1

118
00:04:50,486 --> 00:04:52,856 A:middle
in the active in last 30 days.

119
00:04:54,276 --> 00:04:55,366 A:middle
The last measure
we're going to share

120
00:04:55,366 --> 00:04:57,346 A:middle
with you is in-app purchases.

121
00:04:57,636 --> 00:05:00,446 A:middle
This is again a Store
or sales measure.

122

123
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

124
00:04:57,636 --> 00:05:00,446 A:middle
This is again a Store
or sales measure.

125
00:05:00,746 --> 00:05:02,386 A:middle
In-app purchases is like units

126
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,566 A:middle
where it's the transaction
itself, not the price.

127
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:08,926 A:middle
In this case I bought Northern
California maps for 99 cents.

128
00:05:09,286 --> 00:05:11,386 A:middle
What this will do is
it will take 99 cents

129
00:05:11,386 --> 00:05:12,746 A:middle
and adds it to the app sales.

130
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,716 A:middle
So it's app sales and
in-app purchases combined,

131
00:05:16,076 --> 00:05:18,516 A:middle
but it will generate a1 for
the in-app purchase measure.

132
00:05:19,056 --> 00:05:21,596 A:middle
Combining all these measures,
we get to tell that story

133
00:05:21,596 --> 00:05:22,816 A:middle
of acquisition to engagement.

134
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:24,176 A:middle
App Store views all the way

135
00:05:24,176 --> 00:05:26,426 A:middle
down to in-app purchases
gives you the idea

136
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,046 A:middle
of the entire customer
life cycle.

137
00:05:28,586 --> 00:05:29,566 A:middle
That's great.

138
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:32,086 A:middle
But how do you actually
get started?

139
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:33,216 A:middle
We have good news.

140
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:35,796 A:middle
This is probably the
easiest session in terms

141
00:05:35,796 --> 00:05:38,036 A:middle
of work generated for
you, the developer.

142
00:05:38,486 --> 00:05:40,546 A:middle
There is nothing you need
to do to get started.

143
00:05:41,016 --> 00:05:42,446 A:middle
No code you need to write.

144
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:46,006 A:middle
There is no SDK that
you need to integrate,

145
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:48,106 A:middle
no iOS framework
you need to hook in.

146
00:05:48,376 --> 00:05:51,006 A:middle
This is something completely
built into the operating system

147
00:05:51,006 --> 00:05:52,536 A:middle
and that you get for free.

148
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,206 A:middle
You have to have a
valid developer license.

149
00:05:55,306 --> 00:05:56,816 A:middle
Sales admin or finance role.

150
00:05:57,616 --> 00:05:59,696 A:middle
Not a lot involved to
get going with this.

151
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:03,116 A:middle
It is available for the
App Store, iOS apps only.

152

153
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

154
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:03,116 A:middle
It is available for the
App Store, iOS apps only.

155
00:06:03,626 --> 00:06:05,856 A:middle
And it's available
for iOS 8 and above.

156
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:07,576 A:middle
That means that data
is available

157
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,516 A:middle
when it is generated
from apps on iOS 8.

158
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,746 A:middle
Another important point is
that privacy is built in.

159
00:06:15,836 --> 00:06:18,156 A:middle
With App Analytics, we
wanted to provide developers

160
00:06:18,256 --> 00:06:21,296 A:middle
with a powerful functionality,
powerful feature and tool,

161
00:06:21,596 --> 00:06:23,036 A:middle
and we wanted to do so in a way

162
00:06:23,036 --> 00:06:25,616 A:middle
that we would not
compromise customer privacy.

163
00:06:26,016 --> 00:06:29,176 A:middle
This is built all the way from
the operating system to the UI.

164
00:06:29,726 --> 00:06:32,336 A:middle
iOS has privacy constraints
built in.

165
00:06:32,636 --> 00:06:36,086 A:middle
This means that our usage
measures, customers are prompted

166
00:06:36,086 --> 00:06:37,696 A:middle
with this display
where they can choose

167
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:40,206 A:middle
to share sessions
and active devices.

168
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:42,676 A:middle
We believe that customers
should have a choice,

169
00:06:43,026 --> 00:06:44,756 A:middle
and this is built
into App Analytics.

170
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:46,576 A:middle
Data is available
in aggregate form

171
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,366 A:middle
and not personally identifiable,
it's completely anonymous.

172
00:06:49,396 --> 00:06:51,456 A:middle
What this means for
you as the developers,

173
00:06:51,726 --> 00:06:54,156 A:middle
in the App Analytics
UI you see counts.

174
00:06:54,236 --> 00:06:55,676 A:middle
You do not see the raw data.

175
00:06:56,236 --> 00:06:59,036 A:middle
It is all available
in iTunes Connect.

176
00:06:59,156 --> 00:07:00,976 A:middle
It's available today,
it's no longer in beta.

177

178
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

179
00:06:59,156 --> 00:07:00,976 A:middle
It's available today,
it's no longer in beta.

180
00:07:02,086 --> 00:07:03,646 A:middle
Once you log into
iTunes Connect,

181
00:07:03,646 --> 00:07:06,026 A:middle
you'll see the App
Analytics module show up here.

182
00:07:06,486 --> 00:07:08,496 A:middle
That's it for the
static part of this.

183
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:10,116 A:middle
I'll turn it over
to David Hopkins,

184
00:07:10,516 --> 00:07:13,576 A:middle
and he'll show you an
overview of some key features

185
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:15,386 A:middle
within App Analytics
in an actual demo.

186
00:07:17,516 --> 00:07:25,416 A:middle
[Applause]

187
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,696 A:middle
>> DAVID HOPKINS: Hi, I'm
David Hopkins, and I'm going

188
00:07:28,696 --> 00:07:40,546 A:middle
to give you a quick demo of
the App Analytics product.

189
00:07:40,646 --> 00:07:42,116 A:middle
When you log into
iTunes Connect,

190
00:07:42,116 --> 00:07:44,666 A:middle
you'll see App Analytics
alongside your other modules,

191
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:46,866 A:middle
such as Sales and Trends
and Users and Roles.

192
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:50,246 A:middle
When you click on App Analytics,

193
00:07:50,246 --> 00:07:51,896 A:middle
you will be taken
to the app list.

194
00:07:52,586 --> 00:07:55,466 A:middle
That's the entry point to
the App Analytics product.

195
00:07:55,886 --> 00:07:58,856 A:middle
From here you can see a
snapshot across all of your apps

196
00:07:58,856 --> 00:08:01,826 A:middle
across four key measures,
again measuring all the way

197

198
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

199
00:07:58,856 --> 00:08:01,826 A:middle
across four key measures,
again measuring all the way

200
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:04,006 A:middle
from acquisition
with App Store views

201
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:06,216 A:middle
down to engagement
with sessions.

202
00:08:07,276 --> 00:08:09,836 A:middle
You'll see the value for
the current period as well

203
00:08:09,836 --> 00:08:11,936 A:middle
as a percentage change
from the previous period

204
00:08:11,936 --> 00:08:14,486 A:middle
to help provide some
context as to whether

205
00:08:14,486 --> 00:08:15,556 A:middle
that value is good or bad.

206
00:08:16,806 --> 00:08:19,766 A:middle
If you hover over the percentage
change, you'll see the value

207
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:22,806 A:middle
for this period and the value
for the previous period as well

208
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:25,046 A:middle
as the date ranges
associated with each.

209
00:08:26,016 --> 00:08:28,946 A:middle
The default time period
here is the last 30 days,

210
00:08:28,946 --> 00:08:30,956 A:middle
but you can change which
time period you're looking

211
00:08:30,956 --> 00:08:32,765 A:middle
at from the date
picker in the top right.

212
00:08:33,626 --> 00:08:35,706 A:middle
You can select from
any predefined ranges

213
00:08:36,436 --> 00:08:38,736 A:middle
or select a custom range as well

214
00:08:38,736 --> 00:08:41,405 A:middle
as selecting any
day, week, or month.

215
00:08:42,076 --> 00:08:44,396 A:middle
Now I'm showing you the app list

216
00:08:44,396 --> 00:08:45,596 A:middle
where you can view
all of your apps.

217
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:46,986 A:middle
Let's dive into one of the apps.

218
00:08:47,456 --> 00:08:50,146 A:middle
For those of you who build lots
of great apps, the easiest way

219
00:08:50,146 --> 00:08:51,916 A:middle
to find your app in
here is to search.

220
00:08:52,246 --> 00:08:54,686 A:middle
We can search for
our app Trip Guider.

221
00:08:55,436 --> 00:08:58,206 A:middle
When we click on the app
Trip Guider, we will be taken

222
00:08:58,206 --> 00:08:59,686 A:middle
to the app overview page.

223

224
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

225
00:09:00,446 --> 00:09:02,506 A:middle
The app overview
page is designed

226
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:05,136 A:middle
to give you a high-level
overview of your app.

227
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:08,536 A:middle
The first thing you are going
to see is your all time data

228
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,046 A:middle
for your app since it has
been in App Analytics.

229
00:09:11,286 --> 00:09:14,186 A:middle
Again we are seeing across
the same four measures we saw

230
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:15,976 A:middle
in the app list with
App Store views,

231
00:09:16,316 --> 00:09:18,826 A:middle
app units, sales, and sessions.

232
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:22,786 A:middle
Now is a good time to call
out that Trystan mentioned

233
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:24,456 A:middle
that we take privacy
very seriously.

234
00:09:24,846 --> 00:09:28,536 A:middle
All of our usage data is
available only for the customers

235
00:09:28,536 --> 00:09:29,986 A:middle
who have agreed to opt in

236
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,726 A:middle
and share their data
with developers.

237
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:33,586 A:middle
You'll see this text
that says "opt

238
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:35,666 A:middle
in only" below these
usage measures.

239
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:39,866 A:middle
If you want to know your opt-in
rate specific to your app,

240
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:42,626 A:middle
click on the question mark next
to About App Analytics Data.

241
00:09:43,476 --> 00:09:45,816 A:middle
We click on that, and we can
see for our app Trip Guider

242
00:09:45,816 --> 00:09:49,396 A:middle
that in the last 30
days, 23 percent of users

243
00:09:49,396 --> 00:09:52,046 A:middle
that installed Trip Guider
agreed to share their data.

244
00:09:52,736 --> 00:09:55,076 A:middle
As you move down the page,

245
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:57,046 A:middle
the next thing you'll
see is a breakdown

246
00:09:57,046 --> 00:09:59,216 A:middle
by day across six measures.

247
00:09:59,526 --> 00:10:01,596 A:middle
Again, we are looking at
the last 30 days here.

248

249
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

250
00:09:59,526 --> 00:10:01,596 A:middle
Again, we are looking at
the last 30 days here.

251
00:10:02,386 --> 00:10:05,096 A:middle
You can see the value for
the current period as well

252
00:10:05,096 --> 00:10:07,626 A:middle
as the percentage change
from the previous period,

253
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:09,796 A:middle
but now we have a little
bit more granularity.

254
00:10:09,796 --> 00:10:11,376 A:middle
We can see the graphs by day.

255
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:15,836 A:middle
So for example, we knew that our
app Trip Guider 2.0 is killing

256
00:10:15,836 --> 00:10:17,446 A:middle
it in terms of App Store views.

257
00:10:17,446 --> 00:10:18,626 A:middle
We are up 82 percent.

258
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,556 A:middle
But what we didn't know
is that the majority

259
00:10:21,556 --> 00:10:24,306 A:middle
of this increase came over this
five- or six-day period here.

260
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:26,956 A:middle
We can also hover
over any day to find

261
00:10:26,956 --> 00:10:28,456 A:middle
out the value for that day.

262
00:10:28,786 --> 00:10:31,666 A:middle
We can see that on May 15
we had our peak in terms

263
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:36,856 A:middle
of App Store views, when we had
around 160,000 App Store views.

264
00:10:37,476 --> 00:10:41,696 A:middle
As you move down the page, the
next thing you'll see is a map.

265
00:10:42,386 --> 00:10:45,726 A:middle
This is a map of your
app units by storefront.

266
00:10:45,856 --> 00:10:48,716 A:middle
Here we are looking at which
territories have the most

267
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:49,336 A:middle
app units.

268
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:53,286 A:middle
For Trip Guider, you can see
that most of the app units came

269
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:55,676 A:middle
in the United States,
followed by Thailand.

270
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,506 A:middle
Again, here we are revealing
missed opportunities.

271
00:10:58,786 --> 00:11:01,956 A:middle
Maybe we didn't know that our
app was so popular in Thailand,

272

273
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

274
00:10:58,786 --> 00:11:01,956 A:middle
Maybe we didn't know that our
app was so popular in Thailand,

275
00:11:01,956 --> 00:11:04,656 A:middle
and there's an opportunity for
us to go in and localize our app

276
00:11:04,656 --> 00:11:07,186 A:middle
to Thai to really
optimize the experience

277
00:11:07,186 --> 00:11:08,496 A:middle
for the customers in Thailand.

278
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,456 A:middle
You can change which
measure you're looking at,

279
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:14,396 A:middle
so this default's app units, but
you can select any other measure

280
00:11:14,396 --> 00:11:15,256 A:middle
that Trystan mentioned.

281
00:11:15,596 --> 00:11:18,426 A:middle
Choose sales, and
now we have a map

282
00:11:18,806 --> 00:11:20,876 A:middle
of our top sales by territory.

283
00:11:21,406 --> 00:11:25,066 A:middle
As you move down the page,
the next thing you'll see is

284
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:26,216 A:middle
on the left-hand side.

285
00:11:26,406 --> 00:11:28,616 A:middle
You'll see a graph of
your users' retention.

286
00:11:29,006 --> 00:11:32,626 A:middle
Retention is designed to show
you whether your newly acquired

287
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:35,896 A:middle
customers are staying
engaged with your app.

288
00:11:36,176 --> 00:11:38,646 A:middle
On the right-hand side,
you'll see a breakdown

289
00:11:38,876 --> 00:11:40,786 A:middle
of your app units by platform.

290
00:11:40,956 --> 00:11:43,546 A:middle
Again, you can change which
measure you are looking at here

291
00:11:43,546 --> 00:11:45,506 A:middle
to select from any
of these measures.

292
00:11:46,186 --> 00:11:49,266 A:middle
You can see that for our app
Trip Guider we have 68 percent

293
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:51,396 A:middle
of our app units
coming on the iPhone,

294
00:11:51,456 --> 00:11:54,066 A:middle
followed by 29 percent
on the iPad.

295
00:11:55,636 --> 00:11:57,856 A:middle
Now I'm showing you the app
list where you can see your list

296
00:11:57,856 --> 00:11:59,896 A:middle
of apps as well as
the app overview,

297

298
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

299
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:02,316 A:middle
where you can see a
high-level view of your app.

300
00:12:02,546 --> 00:12:04,786 A:middle
I'm going to hand it back over
to Trystan, who will walk you

301
00:12:04,856 --> 00:12:06,926 A:middle
through how we can dive
into some of this data.

302
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:10,241 A:middle
[Applause]

303
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:11,496 A:middle
>> TRYSTAN KOSMYNKA:
Thank you, David.

304
00:12:12,376 --> 00:12:14,906 A:middle
Gave a quick overview
of App Analytics.

305
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:15,736 A:middle
We had the app list.

306
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,006 A:middle
This is the best way to see all
of your apps at a single view.

307
00:12:18,386 --> 00:12:21,316 A:middle
And the app overview, the best
way to look at a single app,

308
00:12:21,316 --> 00:12:23,646 A:middle
you can see all of the
key measures in one place.

309
00:12:23,646 --> 00:12:25,796 A:middle
We have the beautiful
map, the beautiful chart,

310
00:12:25,796 --> 00:12:27,326 A:middle
and you can see it
broken down by platform.

311
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,056 A:middle
That's just touching
the surface.

312
00:12:29,056 --> 00:12:33,106 A:middle
As a developer or marketer,
you want to see and explore

313
00:12:33,106 --> 00:12:34,806 A:middle
and discover new trends.

314
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:38,006 A:middle
And you can do this with
a feature called Metrics.

315
00:12:38,386 --> 00:12:41,216 A:middle
What Metrics does, we
take those key indicators,

316
00:12:41,216 --> 00:12:42,696 A:middle
all of the measures
we talked about,

317
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:45,076 A:middle
and we add in another
layer called dimensions.

318
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:47,736 A:middle
These dimensions can
be used multiple ways.

319
00:12:47,836 --> 00:12:48,856 A:middle
First, as filters.

320
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,376 A:middle
If you wanted to
answer the question:

321
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:54,666 A:middle
How many sessions am I getting
on my iPhones or my iPads?

322
00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:57,636 A:middle
I can do that by filtering
sessions by platform.

323
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:01,216 A:middle
What if you wanted to see
users, are they coming back?

324

325
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

326
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:01,216 A:middle
What if you wanted to see
users, are they coming back?

327
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:02,726 A:middle
You can filter by purchase date.

328
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,036 A:middle
Is my app version being adopted?

329
00:13:06,116 --> 00:13:08,306 A:middle
You can do this by filtering
by app version as well.

330
00:13:09,176 --> 00:13:10,236 A:middle
Dimensions are a great way

331
00:13:10,236 --> 00:13:13,276 A:middle
to see certain measures
filtered by certain things.

332
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:15,116 A:middle
You also can group the data.

333
00:13:15,116 --> 00:13:17,926 A:middle
If you wanted to see the
composition of your units

334
00:13:18,176 --> 00:13:20,856 A:middle
by a particular platform, you
can view by that data as well.

335
00:13:20,996 --> 00:13:22,706 A:middle
We will show these things.

336
00:13:23,396 --> 00:13:24,776 A:middle
So we have the measures.

337
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:25,516 A:middle
We have the dimensions.

338
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:28,726 A:middle
You can tell interesting stories
by combining these two things.

339
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:32,406 A:middle
We are excited that as of today
there are new measures available

340
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:32,816 A:middle
as well.

341
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:34,186 A:middle
You can tell all-new stories.

342
00:13:34,986 --> 00:13:37,196 A:middle
The first one we are
introducing is Crashes.

343
00:13:37,496 --> 00:13:38,466 A:middle
This is a crash rate.

344
00:13:39,516 --> 00:13:41,866 A:middle
This will show up just
like sessions and installs.

345
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:42,816 A:middle
It's a usage measure.

346
00:13:42,816 --> 00:13:45,686 A:middle
What it will allow you to do
is you can improve the overall

347
00:13:45,686 --> 00:13:46,556 A:middle
stability of your app.

348
00:13:46,956 --> 00:13:49,396 A:middle
If you've really focused on
quality on the next version

349
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,366 A:middle
of your app, once the
app is in the Store,

350
00:13:51,576 --> 00:13:54,816 A:middle
you can filter crashes by
2.0 of your app and see

351
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:56,826 A:middle
if you made the impact
you intended to make.

352
00:13:58,206 --> 00:13:59,676 A:middle
Next, we have a new
sales measure.

353
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:00,846 A:middle
This is Paying Users.

354

355
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

356
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:00,846 A:middle
This is Paying Users.

357
00:14:01,526 --> 00:14:04,136 A:middle
If we look at sales,
sales is a number

358
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:05,946 A:middle
that hopefully is
increasing over time.

359
00:14:06,306 --> 00:14:08,296 A:middle
But if you have users that
are purchasing multiple times

360
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:10,686 A:middle
within the app, Paying Users
can give you that visibility.

361
00:14:10,986 --> 00:14:13,816 A:middle
It is the unique count of
how many users have purchased

362
00:14:13,876 --> 00:14:16,766 A:middle
within your app on a
given day, week, or month.

363
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:17,656 A:middle
It's really powerful.

364
00:14:18,196 --> 00:14:23,866 A:middle
Now, on the topic of power,
we have all of our measures.

365
00:14:23,866 --> 00:14:25,916 A:middle
We have the two new measures
we are excited about.

366
00:14:26,306 --> 00:14:28,246 A:middle
There's also power
in comparing things.

367
00:14:28,426 --> 00:14:31,186 A:middle
I'll give you some practical
examples before David demos

368
00:14:31,186 --> 00:14:33,596 A:middle
of things you should
be commonly comparing

369
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:34,936 A:middle
as you are marketing your app,

370
00:14:34,936 --> 00:14:36,566 A:middle
as you are making
product decisions as well.

371
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,466 A:middle
The first is product
page conversion rate.

372
00:14:39,676 --> 00:14:41,386 A:middle
This is the overall
effectiveness

373
00:14:41,386 --> 00:14:42,306 A:middle
of your product page.

374
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:45,716 A:middle
It is important to focus
on quality screenshots,

375
00:14:45,816 --> 00:14:49,766 A:middle
using app video previews, making
sure your text sounds great.

376
00:14:50,206 --> 00:14:53,186 A:middle
You do this by comparing app
units in App Store views.

377
00:14:53,186 --> 00:14:55,506 A:middle
It will give you an
overall score, so to speak,

378
00:14:55,656 --> 00:14:56,846 A:middle
of how that page is doing.

379
00:14:56,846 --> 00:14:58,586 A:middle
And you can compare this
across all of your apps.

380
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:01,316 A:middle
Next is average revenue
per paying user.

381

382
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

383
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:01,316 A:middle
Next is average revenue
per paying user.

384
00:15:01,686 --> 00:15:04,946 A:middle
We take that new measure, Paying
Users, and compare it to sales.

385
00:15:05,276 --> 00:15:07,206 A:middle
This gives me an
apples-to-apples comparison

386
00:15:07,436 --> 00:15:08,586 A:middle
across all my apps.

387
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:12,446 A:middle
Are my users in app A spending
more than my users in app B?

388
00:15:12,486 --> 00:15:15,006 A:middle
This is a really important
metric that you can use

389
00:15:15,006 --> 00:15:16,346 A:middle
to grow your overall sales

390
00:15:16,346 --> 00:15:18,466 A:middle
and grow the overall
health of your app.

391
00:15:19,236 --> 00:15:20,846 A:middle
Next, crashes per session.

392
00:15:21,316 --> 00:15:23,766 A:middle
Again, Crashes is a
measure you want to use

393
00:15:23,766 --> 00:15:25,166 A:middle
to improve the stability
of your app.

394
00:15:25,546 --> 00:15:27,876 A:middle
You can use crashes per
session as a comparison

395
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:30,686 A:middle
to see how you are doing
against your other apps.

396
00:15:31,796 --> 00:15:35,336 A:middle
The last example we'll share
is sessions per active device.

397
00:15:35,336 --> 00:15:36,926 A:middle
This is taking the
Sessions metric

398
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:38,166 A:middle
and Active Devices metric,

399
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,716 A:middle
and by using these
two I get a comparison

400
00:15:40,716 --> 00:15:41,756 A:middle
across all of my apps.

401
00:15:42,126 --> 00:15:43,946 A:middle
I will turn it over to
David, and he's going

402
00:15:43,946 --> 00:15:45,526 A:middle
to demo the power
of the metrics view.

403
00:15:45,816 --> 00:15:48,096 A:middle
And again, these new measures,
Paying Users and Crashes,

404
00:15:48,376 --> 00:15:51,266 A:middle
this is data that you do
not integrate to SDK for,

405
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:52,996 A:middle
and it's data that
only Apple can provide.

406
00:15:53,246 --> 00:15:55,536 A:middle
Paying Users comes straight
from the sales data.

407
00:15:55,796 --> 00:15:57,936 A:middle
It is something that is
unique to App Analytics.

408
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,676 A:middle
>> DAVID HOPKINS:
Thanks, Trystan.

409

410
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

411
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,676 A:middle
>> DAVID HOPKINS:
Thanks, Trystan.

412
00:16:03,026 --> 00:16:05,536 A:middle
So when we left off, we were
looking at the app overview.

413
00:16:05,536 --> 00:16:08,256 A:middle
As Trystan mentioned, if you
want to dive into your data,

414
00:16:08,346 --> 00:16:10,286 A:middle
the best place to do it
is in the metrics view.

415
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:14,516 A:middle
The metrics view is a tab
within the context of your app.

416
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,976 A:middle
We can click that, and it will
take us to the metrics view.

417
00:16:17,396 --> 00:16:20,236 A:middle
You can click on any of
the data in the overview,

418
00:16:20,236 --> 00:16:23,196 A:middle
and it will take you to the
metrics view that data selected.

419
00:16:23,726 --> 00:16:26,336 A:middle
For example, we are looking

420
00:16:26,336 --> 00:16:28,496 A:middle
at our app units
broken down by platform.

421
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:30,386 A:middle
Say we wanted to
take a deeper look

422
00:16:30,386 --> 00:16:32,986 A:middle
at our iPhone users
and our app units.

423
00:16:32,986 --> 00:16:36,576 A:middle
We can click on that, and now
we are taken to the metrics view

424
00:16:36,816 --> 00:16:38,966 A:middle
with our app units
selected, and we're looking

425
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:40,696 A:middle
at just our users on the iPhone.

426
00:16:41,396 --> 00:16:42,826 A:middle
What you'll see in
the metrics view is

427
00:16:42,826 --> 00:16:46,086 A:middle
in the top left you'll see the
value for the period as well

428
00:16:46,196 --> 00:16:49,766 A:middle
as a chart where we break
down your app units by day.

429
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:53,186 A:middle
If you hover over a day, you'll
see the value for that day.

430
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:57,006 A:middle
If you scroll below the
chart, you'll see a table

431
00:16:57,006 --> 00:16:58,986 A:middle
that contains the
value for each day.

432
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:03,696 A:middle
And if you scroll to the top,
the next thing we will talk

433

434
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

435
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:03,696 A:middle
And if you scroll to the top,
the next thing we will talk

436
00:17:03,696 --> 00:17:04,786 A:middle
about are your measures.

437
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:07,076 A:middle
On the left-hand
side you can see

438
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:09,056 A:middle
that we have app units selected.

439
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,766 A:middle
Your measures are broken
down by sales and usage.

440
00:17:13,586 --> 00:17:15,836 A:middle
If you have any questions
about any of these measures

441
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:18,026 A:middle
at any time, you can
hover over the measure

442
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:19,435 A:middle
and you'll see a question mark.

443
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:21,715 A:middle
If you click on that
question mark,

444
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:23,165 A:middle
you'll get the definition
of the measure.

445
00:17:23,165 --> 00:17:25,726 A:middle
So we talked about this
new measure, Paying Users.

446
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:29,796 A:middle
You can see it says the number
of unique users that paid

447
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:33,056 A:middle
for the app or an
in-app purchase.

448
00:17:33,206 --> 00:17:34,816 A:middle
Great. I talked about
how we are looking

449
00:17:34,816 --> 00:17:36,776 A:middle
at just our app units
on the iPhone.

450
00:17:37,106 --> 00:17:39,516 A:middle
To do this, we have
a concept of filters.

451
00:17:39,956 --> 00:17:43,346 A:middle
To add a filter, click
on the top right,

452
00:17:43,346 --> 00:17:44,986 A:middle
and you can add up
to two filters.

453
00:17:44,986 --> 00:17:46,396 A:middle
Right now you can see
that we are looking

454
00:17:46,396 --> 00:17:47,986 A:middle
at just our users on the iPhone.

455
00:17:48,446 --> 00:17:50,146 A:middle
We can click to add
a second filter.

456
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:54,096 A:middle
So let's look at our users on
the iPhone in the United States.

457
00:17:54,746 --> 00:17:58,846 A:middle
And now we are looking
at just those users

458
00:17:58,846 --> 00:18:00,606 A:middle
on the iPhone in
the United States.

459

460
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

461
00:17:58,846 --> 00:18:00,606 A:middle
on the iPhone in
the United States.

462
00:18:00,936 --> 00:18:03,946 A:middle
You can also change which
version you're looking at.

463
00:18:03,946 --> 00:18:05,616 A:middle
If you want to switch
between platforms,

464
00:18:06,196 --> 00:18:11,636 A:middle
select from iPhone
and switch to iPad.

465
00:18:11,776 --> 00:18:15,226 A:middle
Great. Now I've shown you how
to look at a specific value

466
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:16,666 A:middle
within any given dimension.

467
00:18:17,026 --> 00:18:20,026 A:middle
Oftentimes, you want to
instead compare the values

468
00:18:20,026 --> 00:18:21,016 A:middle
within a given dimension.

469
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:23,866 A:middle
To do this, we have a
feature called View By.

470
00:18:24,316 --> 00:18:28,776 A:middle
If we remove our filters, and
let's say we want to look at all

471
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:31,536 A:middle
of our top territories
for our app units and see

472
00:18:31,536 --> 00:18:32,686 A:middle
which ones rank the highest.

473
00:18:33,076 --> 00:18:36,326 A:middle
We can select View By,
and select territory,

474
00:18:36,326 --> 00:18:40,176 A:middle
and now you'll see all of
your top territories plotted

475
00:18:40,176 --> 00:18:41,746 A:middle
over time for app units.

476
00:18:42,546 --> 00:18:45,436 A:middle
Again, if you hover over
the graph on any given day,

477
00:18:45,436 --> 00:18:47,916 A:middle
you can see the value for
each of your top territories.

478
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:51,656 A:middle
If you scroll down below the
chart, you'll see a table

479
00:18:51,656 --> 00:18:54,456 A:middle
that contains the total
value for each territory.

480
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:58,176 A:middle
And you can see here that we
have five territories selected

481
00:18:58,176 --> 00:18:58,806 A:middle
by default.

482
00:18:58,806 --> 00:18:59,976 A:middle
These are the top territories.

483

484
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

485
00:19:00,026 --> 00:19:02,586 A:middle
But you can also
deselect any of these.

486
00:19:02,586 --> 00:19:05,296 A:middle
We can deselect Brazil
and then plot Japan.

487
00:19:05,736 --> 00:19:07,506 A:middle
Now the graph will update.

488
00:19:08,836 --> 00:19:11,276 A:middle
The default view here
is as a line chart,

489
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:14,646 A:middle
but you can also change this to
an area chart or a bar chart.

490
00:19:14,716 --> 00:19:15,766 A:middle
We can switch to area.

491
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:19,656 A:middle
That gives us a nice view
of the overall curve as well

492
00:19:19,656 --> 00:19:21,256 A:middle
as a breakdown for
each dimension.

493
00:19:21,816 --> 00:19:25,086 A:middle
Okay. So now I've shown you
how to compare the values

494
00:19:25,086 --> 00:19:26,296 A:middle
within a given dimension.

495
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,466 A:middle
But sometimes you're
more interested

496
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:30,696 A:middle
in the relationship
between two measures.

497
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,026 A:middle
One example of this that Trystan
talked about is the relationship

498
00:19:34,026 --> 00:19:36,246 A:middle
between app units
and App Store views.

499
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,476 A:middle
You'll call this your
product page conversion rate.

500
00:19:39,616 --> 00:19:42,606 A:middle
What percentage of users are
landing on your App Store page

501
00:19:42,606 --> 00:19:44,086 A:middle
and going on to purchase
your app?

502
00:19:44,786 --> 00:19:46,916 A:middle
To do this, we have a
feature called Compare To.

503
00:19:47,596 --> 00:19:49,416 A:middle
From here, we're
looking at app units,

504
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,896 A:middle
and we can select
another measure.

505
00:19:50,896 --> 00:19:52,926 A:middle
So we'll select App Store views.

506
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,636 A:middle
Now you'll see both
your app units

507
00:19:55,636 --> 00:19:58,076 A:middle
and App Store views
plotted on the same chart.

508
00:19:58,846 --> 00:20:01,466 A:middle
The default view here, we're
looking at a dual-axes graph.

509

510
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

511
00:19:58,846 --> 00:20:01,466 A:middle
The default view here, we're
looking at a dual-axes graph.

512
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:04,406 A:middle
You can hover over any
day and see the value

513
00:20:04,406 --> 00:20:05,886 A:middle
for each of those measures.

514
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,946 A:middle
In the top-left corner you
can see the total value

515
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:10,136 A:middle
for each of those measures.

516
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:12,996 A:middle
This is a really nice way
to view the relationship

517
00:20:12,996 --> 00:20:15,406 A:middle
between these measures, see
how they trend over time.

518
00:20:15,946 --> 00:20:19,236 A:middle
We are excited to announce
some new enhancements

519
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:21,436 A:middle
that we're bringing to
Compare To as of today.

520
00:20:22,626 --> 00:20:25,416 A:middle
Instead of just being able to
view this on a dual-axes chart,

521
00:20:25,646 --> 00:20:29,216 A:middle
we added the ability to
view this rate over time

522
00:20:29,466 --> 00:20:31,786 A:middle
with the new feature
we call Ratios.

523
00:20:32,086 --> 00:20:34,246 A:middle
So from here, you can
select new chart types,

524
00:20:34,756 --> 00:20:36,286 A:middle
from Single Access and Ratio.

525
00:20:36,286 --> 00:20:37,496 A:middle
We'll select Ratio.

526
00:20:37,996 --> 00:20:41,766 A:middle
And now you can see the
ratio between your app units

527
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:44,386 A:middle
and App Store views
plotted over time.

528
00:20:44,996 --> 00:20:46,246 A:middle
That gives you a nice picture

529
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,936 A:middle
of that product page conversion
rate that Trystan talked about.

530
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:52,816 A:middle
You can see here that
we're at around 18 percent

531
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:56,096 A:middle
for the last 30 days,
but a few weeks ago

532
00:20:56,096 --> 00:20:59,686 A:middle
for Trip Guider 2.0 we made
some updates to our description

533
00:20:59,686 --> 00:21:01,436 A:middle
of the app on the
App Store page.

534

535
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

536
00:20:59,686 --> 00:21:01,436 A:middle
of the app on the
App Store page.

537
00:21:01,776 --> 00:21:03,076 A:middle
And thanks to App Analytics,

538
00:21:03,236 --> 00:21:07,216 A:middle
we are able to see the product
page conversion rate drop off

539
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:08,126 A:middle
right here.

540
00:21:08,126 --> 00:21:09,776 A:middle
We got down to about 6 percent.

541
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:12,646 A:middle
So what we did is we
went and updated the copy

542
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,006 A:middle
to the description of
our App Store page,

543
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:17,986 A:middle
and we saw that product page
conversion rate rise over time.

544
00:21:18,506 --> 00:21:21,116 A:middle
As you go on you can see
that now we are back up to

545
00:21:21,116 --> 00:21:23,326 A:middle
around 30 percent
conversion rate.

546
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,836 A:middle
Great. Now I've shown you how to
use some of the power features

547
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:29,256 A:middle
in the metrics view, and I'll
hand it back over to Trystan.

548
00:21:30,126 --> 00:21:31,276 A:middle
>> TRYSTAN KOSMYNKA: So
David went through metrics.

549
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:33,366 A:middle
This is the best way to
explore and discover things

550
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:34,686 A:middle
and reveal those
missed opportunities

551
00:21:34,686 --> 00:21:35,606 A:middle
within App Analytics.

552
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:36,626 A:middle
If you want to dive deeper

553
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:38,536 A:middle
than the overview,
this is that feature.

554
00:21:39,386 --> 00:21:41,646 A:middle
One question we have
not answered yet is,

555
00:21:41,816 --> 00:21:43,186 A:middle
how do people find your app?

556
00:21:43,446 --> 00:21:46,036 A:middle
This is a question that is
hard without App Analytics.

557
00:21:46,446 --> 00:21:48,696 A:middle
To do this, we have a
feature called Sources.

558
00:21:49,126 --> 00:21:51,636 A:middle
App Analytics has
two types of sources.

559
00:21:52,196 --> 00:21:54,426 A:middle
The first is completely
organic and free.

560
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:56,676 A:middle
You do not need to do any work
to take advantage of this.

561
00:21:56,676 --> 00:21:57,616 A:middle
This is websites.

562
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:01,036 A:middle
If you are actively marketing
your application on websites,

563

564
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

565
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:01,036 A:middle
If you are actively marketing
your application on websites,

566
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:04,256 A:middle
forums, maybe it's getting
picked up by the press as well.

567
00:22:04,696 --> 00:22:08,096 A:middle
Websites, any time a link to
your App Store page is present,

568
00:22:08,396 --> 00:22:11,456 A:middle
we capture the web-referring
URL and present

569
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,416 A:middle
that to you in App Analytics.

570
00:22:13,756 --> 00:22:17,096 A:middle
It is important that these,
both websites and campaigns,

571
00:22:17,096 --> 00:22:18,886 A:middle
they slice across
your entire data set.

572
00:22:19,286 --> 00:22:23,216 A:middle
You are able to filter App
Store views, in-app purchases,

573
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,726 A:middle
the new measures
such as Paying Users.

574
00:22:25,936 --> 00:22:27,826 A:middle
You can filter these
by the website

575
00:22:27,826 --> 00:22:31,596 A:middle
and see how effective those apps
are at increasing these metrics.

576
00:22:32,336 --> 00:22:33,986 A:middle
Next we have campaigns.

577
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:36,146 A:middle
So websites is something
that you don't need

578
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,516 A:middle
to do anything to
take advantage of.

579
00:22:37,516 --> 00:22:40,026 A:middle
If you log in today, you
should be pleasantly surprised

580
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,176 A:middle
that there are websites
available for your apps.

581
00:22:42,786 --> 00:22:44,516 A:middle
Campaigns: you do
need to create them,

582
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:46,466 A:middle
and we will talk about this.

583
00:22:47,436 --> 00:22:48,986 A:middle
The easiest way,
the vanilla way,

584
00:22:48,986 --> 00:22:51,726 A:middle
to create them is your App Store
URL, you add a provider token.

585
00:22:52,156 --> 00:22:53,726 A:middle
In our example, we have
one, two, three, four.

586
00:22:53,826 --> 00:22:55,246 A:middle
That is not your provider token.

587
00:22:55,246 --> 00:22:59,606 A:middle
If you use 1234, you won't get
campaigns in your dashboards.

588

589
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

590
00:23:00,986 --> 00:23:02,866 A:middle
You can then add
a campaign token.

591
00:23:03,276 --> 00:23:06,626 A:middle
My recommendation to you
is that we take an event

592
00:23:06,626 --> 00:23:08,476 A:middle
and placement approach
with this.

593
00:23:08,576 --> 00:23:12,396 A:middle
Think of WWDC as the event
and placement as newsletter

594
00:23:12,396 --> 00:23:13,686 A:middle
or forums or home page.

595
00:23:13,946 --> 00:23:16,356 A:middle
You combine these in a
single string, and that way

596
00:23:16,356 --> 00:23:19,076 A:middle
when you see it in App
Analytics, you know what it was

597
00:23:19,076 --> 00:23:20,586 A:middle
for and where it was running.

598
00:23:21,076 --> 00:23:23,966 A:middle
There are all kinds of ways you
can do this, and we want you

599
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:25,066 A:middle
to experiment with it.

600
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:26,416 A:middle
We think it's really important.

601
00:23:27,576 --> 00:23:30,036 A:middle
The next way to create
a campaign is StoreKit.

602
00:23:30,036 --> 00:23:32,586 A:middle
If you're using StoreKit
today, all you need

603
00:23:32,586 --> 00:23:34,506 A:middle
to do is add two parameters.

604
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,546 A:middle
Add the Provider Token
parameter, it's a constant

605
00:23:37,546 --> 00:23:41,176 A:middle
in this dictionary, and you add
your Campaign Token parameter.

606
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:44,466 A:middle
If you are not using
StoreKit, it's an easy way

607
00:23:44,796 --> 00:23:48,716 A:middle
to create an in-app App
Store-type experience.

608
00:23:49,056 --> 00:23:51,806 A:middle
You can cross-promote your
own titles within StoreKit,

609
00:23:51,946 --> 00:23:54,156 A:middle
and it's the best way to
get a nice conversion rate

610
00:23:54,236 --> 00:23:56,356 A:middle
for installs within
your own app.

611
00:23:56,356 --> 00:23:57,776 A:middle
It is designed by Apple.

612
00:23:57,886 --> 00:24:00,516 A:middle
You don't need to create
your own mimicked App Store

613

614
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

615
00:23:57,886 --> 00:24:00,516 A:middle
You don't need to create
your own mimicked App Store

616
00:24:00,516 --> 00:24:01,076 A:middle
within an app.

617
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:04,966 A:middle
The last way to create
campaigns is smart app banners.

618
00:24:05,506 --> 00:24:07,626 A:middle
If you have a home page on which
you're advertising your apps

619
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,806 A:middle
today, you've probably
seen this already.

620
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:11,826 A:middle
If you're creating an app

621
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:13,166 A:middle
and this is the first
time you're here,

622
00:24:13,396 --> 00:24:16,836 A:middle
you can add a meta tag to your
home page and that meta tag,

623
00:24:16,836 --> 00:24:19,336 A:middle
you can add a provider
token and campaign token

624
00:24:19,336 --> 00:24:23,046 A:middle
to your affiliate data, and
that campaign will be attributed

625
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:24,826 A:middle
to all of the traffic
coming through.

626
00:24:25,446 --> 00:24:27,756 A:middle
To demo this, David
will come up again.

627
00:24:27,756 --> 00:24:30,536 A:middle
He's going to walk through
sources, how you see it.

628
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:32,616 A:middle
He's also going to talk about
how you create a campaign

629
00:24:32,776 --> 00:24:34,736 A:middle
and how you can get that
provider token from the UI.

630
00:24:36,176 --> 00:24:36,546 A:middle
>> DAVID HOPKINS: Great.

631
00:24:36,546 --> 00:24:38,276 A:middle
So as Trystan mentioned,
there's two types

632
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:40,406 A:middle
of sources we track
in App Analytics.

633
00:24:40,406 --> 00:24:43,286 A:middle
You have your top websites
and your top campaigns.

634
00:24:43,926 --> 00:24:47,146 A:middle
Websites are tracked any
time a user follows a link

635
00:24:47,146 --> 00:24:50,046 A:middle
in mobile Safari to
your App Store page.

636
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:53,636 A:middle
For example, we have our
website for Trip Guider,

637
00:24:53,636 --> 00:24:55,636 A:middle
which is Trip Guider.apple.com,

638
00:24:55,866 --> 00:24:57,846 A:middle
and we've implemented a
smart banner that links

639
00:24:57,846 --> 00:24:59,086 A:middle
to our App Store page.

640
00:24:59,496 --> 00:25:01,226 A:middle
Any time a user follows
that link,

641

642
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

643
00:24:59,496 --> 00:25:01,226 A:middle
Any time a user follows
that link,

644
00:25:01,616 --> 00:25:03,256 A:middle
it's going to generate
a App Store view.

645
00:25:03,466 --> 00:25:05,516 A:middle
Any time the user goes
on to purchase the app,

646
00:25:05,516 --> 00:25:07,646 A:middle
it will generate an app unit.

647
00:25:08,026 --> 00:25:10,196 A:middle
And so on for sales,
and sessions,

648
00:25:10,436 --> 00:25:11,626 A:middle
and all of your measures.

649
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:14,126 A:middle
This view should be familiar.

650
00:25:14,126 --> 00:25:16,506 A:middle
It's the same view we
saw for our app list.

651
00:25:16,586 --> 00:25:18,886 A:middle
Now we are looking
at our top websites.

652
00:25:19,816 --> 00:25:22,806 A:middle
You can click on any of the
websites, and you'll be taken

653
00:25:22,806 --> 00:25:24,836 A:middle
to the source overview
for that website.

654
00:25:25,246 --> 00:25:27,626 A:middle
Again, this view is going
to be familiar to you.

655
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:30,576 A:middle
It is the same view you
saw for your app overview.

656
00:25:30,856 --> 00:25:33,426 A:middle
Now you are looking at
just your users who came

657
00:25:33,426 --> 00:25:35,306 A:middle
from Trip Guider.apple.com.

658
00:25:35,886 --> 00:25:39,766 A:middle
So the great thing
about websites is

659
00:25:39,766 --> 00:25:40,856 A:middle
that you get them for free.

660
00:25:41,016 --> 00:25:43,846 A:middle
You don't have to do anything
to implement your websites.

661
00:25:43,906 --> 00:25:45,506 A:middle
They just show up automatically.

662
00:25:45,506 --> 00:25:48,916 A:middle
Any link that goes to the App
Store page will just show up.

663
00:25:49,586 --> 00:25:51,806 A:middle
The other type of source
we have is campaigns.

664
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:55,176 A:middle
Campaigns are great because
you can use them anywhere.

665
00:25:55,176 --> 00:25:56,816 A:middle
They are not just
working on mobile Safari.

666
00:25:56,816 --> 00:25:57,736 A:middle
Anywhere on iOS.

667
00:25:57,976 --> 00:26:00,776 A:middle
We can send out an email,
put them on social media,

668

669
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

670
00:25:57,976 --> 00:26:00,776 A:middle
We can send out an email,
put them on social media,

671
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:02,796 A:middle
but they require setup.

672
00:26:03,206 --> 00:26:06,566 A:middle
So for most of you, when you
log in you'll see something

673
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:08,576 A:middle
like this like we have
for Trip Guider.com,

674
00:26:08,846 --> 00:26:10,696 A:middle
which is an empty
list of our campaigns.

675
00:26:11,376 --> 00:26:13,576 A:middle
I'll walk you through
how to set up a campaign.

676
00:26:14,856 --> 00:26:18,656 A:middle
For Trip Guider, we want to
promote the use of Trip Guider

677
00:26:18,656 --> 00:26:22,056 A:middle
in order to find
things to do for WWDC.

678
00:26:22,056 --> 00:26:24,366 A:middle
I'll show you how to set
up that WWDC campaign.

679
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:26,346 A:middle
As Trystan mentioned,
all you have

680
00:26:26,346 --> 00:26:29,696 A:middle
to do is add a provider token
and campaign token to your URL.

681
00:26:30,086 --> 00:26:32,556 A:middle
But to make this even
easier, we have a tool

682
00:26:32,686 --> 00:26:34,646 A:middle
that generates the
campaign link.

683
00:26:35,556 --> 00:26:38,336 A:middle
When you follow this
link, you'll see here

684
00:26:39,846 --> 00:26:41,486 A:middle
that you have a tool
and all you have,

685
00:26:41,486 --> 00:26:45,016 A:middle
is you have your app selector,
so you can switch between apps,

686
00:26:45,016 --> 00:26:46,266 A:middle
we have Trip Guider selected.

687
00:26:46,266 --> 00:26:49,316 A:middle
And that will populate
your app's app ID as well

688
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,486 A:middle
as that provider ID that
Trystan talked about.

689
00:26:52,006 --> 00:26:54,356 A:middle
And here we can enter
the campaign name,

690
00:26:54,396 --> 00:26:59,696 A:middle
so we'll say WWDC --
whoops, there we go.

691
00:26:59,836 --> 00:27:02,926 A:middle
2015. It generates
a campaign link.

692

693
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

694
00:26:59,836 --> 00:27:02,926 A:middle
2015. It generates
a campaign link.

695
00:27:03,716 --> 00:27:05,396 A:middle
Now you can copy
this campaign link

696
00:27:05,396 --> 00:27:09,066 A:middle
and you can put it anywhere, in
an email, on your social media.

697
00:27:09,346 --> 00:27:11,336 A:middle
You'll start to see
your campaigns show up.

698
00:27:11,336 --> 00:27:13,296 A:middle
It is also important to note

699
00:27:13,296 --> 00:27:15,856 A:middle
that generating the
campaign link does not mean

700
00:27:15,856 --> 00:27:18,606 A:middle
that you'll see the campaigns
in your top campaigns list.

701
00:27:19,256 --> 00:27:21,046 A:middle
Campaigns will only
start to show

702
00:27:21,046 --> 00:27:22,596 A:middle
up once you have five users.

703
00:27:22,706 --> 00:27:25,626 A:middle
Follow that link and then
go and purchase your app.

704
00:27:26,816 --> 00:27:29,586 A:middle
So now that I've shown you
how to generate a campaign,

705
00:27:29,586 --> 00:27:30,426 A:middle
let's take a look at an app

706
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,276 A:middle
where we've already
started use campaigns.

707
00:27:32,586 --> 00:27:35,176 A:middle
The easiest way to
switch between apps is

708
00:27:35,176 --> 00:27:36,826 A:middle
to use the app switcher
in the top left.

709
00:27:37,306 --> 00:27:41,486 A:middle
So we switch from Trip Guider
to our other app, Tide Minder.

710
00:27:42,086 --> 00:27:45,796 A:middle
And now we can see
the list of campaigns

711
00:27:45,796 --> 00:27:47,446 A:middle
that we set up for Tide Minder.

712
00:27:47,566 --> 00:27:49,386 A:middle
So, for example, we
set up a campaign

713
00:27:49,386 --> 00:27:50,676 A:middle
to track our home page here.

714
00:27:51,016 --> 00:27:53,196 A:middle
So we have our display
home page campaign

715
00:27:53,316 --> 00:27:54,536 A:middle
that is showing up in the list.

716
00:27:55,326 --> 00:27:57,686 A:middle
Similar to what you
saw in the app overview

717
00:27:57,686 --> 00:28:00,496 A:middle
and the top websites
overview, you can click on this

718

719
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

720
00:27:57,686 --> 00:28:00,496 A:middle
and the top websites
overview, you can click on this

721
00:28:00,496 --> 00:28:03,396 A:middle
and you will be taken to
your campaign overview

722
00:28:03,396 --> 00:28:06,266 A:middle
where you can see a high level
of how this campaign is doing.

723
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:08,006 A:middle
So now I've shown you how

724
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:09,766 A:middle
to track these two
different types of sources.

725
00:28:09,766 --> 00:28:11,476 A:middle
We hope that you go
out and start setting

726
00:28:11,476 --> 00:28:12,636 A:middle
up campaigns right away.

727
00:28:12,986 --> 00:28:14,246 A:middle
I'll hand it back
over to Trystan.

728
00:28:15,516 --> 00:28:19,106 A:middle
[Applause]

729
00:28:19,606 --> 00:28:19,866 A:middle
>> TRYSTAN KOSMYNKA: All right.

730
00:28:20,176 --> 00:28:20,856 A:middle
Thank you, David.

731
00:28:21,136 --> 00:28:23,466 A:middle
David covered the campaign
list, the website list.

732
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:25,786 A:middle
Very familiar to the
app list as well.

733
00:28:26,026 --> 00:28:28,126 A:middle
It filters all of your data
by a particular website.

734
00:28:28,386 --> 00:28:30,626 A:middle
We show the top campaigns
and the top websites here,

735
00:28:30,826 --> 00:28:32,726 A:middle
and then we have the
overview so you can see all

736
00:28:32,726 --> 00:28:33,926 A:middle
of it in a single shot.

737
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,226 A:middle
If you're running a campaign,
perhaps you're paying

738
00:28:36,226 --> 00:28:37,116 A:middle
for the campaign as well.

739
00:28:37,346 --> 00:28:39,146 A:middle
This is a great view to
just look at and see,

740
00:28:39,146 --> 00:28:40,316 A:middle
how is it actually doing?

741
00:28:40,316 --> 00:28:42,636 A:middle
Is it money well spent?

742
00:28:42,816 --> 00:28:44,446 A:middle
Last question we'd
like to answer is,

743
00:28:44,776 --> 00:28:46,296 A:middle
are customers returning
to the app?

744
00:28:46,586 --> 00:28:49,356 A:middle
David mentioned there's
a retention widget inside

745
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:50,036 A:middle
the overview.

746
00:28:50,246 --> 00:28:52,136 A:middle
We will go into this
in some more detail,

747
00:28:52,136 --> 00:28:53,656 A:middle
go over the retention feature.

748
00:28:55,126 --> 00:28:57,236 A:middle
Before we do that,
before we show the UI,

749
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:00,216 A:middle
I want to give a lesson on
how this actually works.

750

751
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

752
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:00,216 A:middle
I want to give a lesson on
how this actually works.

753
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:02,246 A:middle
We have a purchase date.

754
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:05,386 A:middle
And what makes sense is that
100 percent of the customers

755
00:29:05,386 --> 00:29:07,586 A:middle
who purchase the
app are customers

756
00:29:07,586 --> 00:29:08,306 A:middle
on their purchase data.

757
00:29:08,306 --> 00:29:09,306 A:middle
They've remained customers.

758
00:29:09,306 --> 00:29:09,926 A:middle
They are retained.

759
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,706 A:middle
What isn't as obvious is
that a couple days later

760
00:29:14,006 --> 00:29:15,436 A:middle
and all the way up
to 30 days later,

761
00:29:15,826 --> 00:29:17,796 A:middle
less of them are
actually active customers.

762
00:29:18,076 --> 00:29:21,876 A:middle
So here we see day two, 45
percent are remaining customers,

763
00:29:21,876 --> 00:29:23,596 A:middle
and then on day 30,
we see 10 percent.

764
00:29:23,776 --> 00:29:25,806 A:middle
So what we're looking at here
is a single purchase date,

765
00:29:26,146 --> 00:29:27,406 A:middle
and then seven days later,

766
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:29,396 A:middle
20 percent of the
customers are retained.

767
00:29:30,046 --> 00:29:31,116 A:middle
We're going to bring this down,

768
00:29:31,116 --> 00:29:33,356 A:middle
and we see that June 1
is our real example here.

769
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:35,096 A:middle
So June 1, two days later,

770
00:29:35,196 --> 00:29:37,016 A:middle
45 percent of the
customers were retained.

771
00:29:37,846 --> 00:29:39,716 A:middle
One purchase date is great
to look at, but you want

772
00:29:39,716 --> 00:29:42,346 A:middle
to compare this because
you are making many changes

773
00:29:42,576 --> 00:29:43,736 A:middle
over the course of
time and you want

774
00:29:43,736 --> 00:29:45,966 A:middle
to compare multiple purchase
dates in a single shot.

775
00:29:46,446 --> 00:29:47,616 A:middle
We added June 2.

776
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:49,486 A:middle
We have June 1 and 2 now.

777
00:29:49,806 --> 00:29:50,846 A:middle
Let's expand that even more.

778
00:29:50,846 --> 00:29:51,466 A:middle
That is not enough.

779
00:29:52,026 --> 00:29:53,826 A:middle
Now I see June 1 to June 9.

780
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:55,246 A:middle
I'm looking at nine
purchase days.

781
00:29:55,536 --> 00:29:57,066 A:middle
We've changed the
numbers now as well.

782
00:29:57,066 --> 00:30:01,246 A:middle
At the top I have 45 percent
for two days after June 1.

783

784
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

785
00:29:57,066 --> 00:30:01,246 A:middle
At the top I have 45 percent
for two days after June 1.

786
00:30:02,156 --> 00:30:04,646 A:middle
At the bottom, June
9, I have 60 percent.

787
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:06,976 A:middle
So it's a little hard to read
because it's a single color.

788
00:30:06,976 --> 00:30:09,836 A:middle
So what we've also done to
this heat map is we've added

789
00:30:10,256 --> 00:30:12,566 A:middle
colorization, so I can
see that 10 percent

790
00:30:12,566 --> 00:30:15,716 A:middle
of my customers 30 days
later have returned

791
00:30:15,716 --> 00:30:17,016 A:middle
on the June 1 purchase date.

792
00:30:17,356 --> 00:30:18,816 A:middle
That's a lighter
color indicating

793
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:21,146 A:middle
that the retention is not
so good at that point.

794
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:22,906 A:middle
Go down to the bottom right,

795
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:25,296 A:middle
and I see a darker color
indicating there's a hotspot

796
00:30:25,296 --> 00:30:27,436 A:middle
there, those improvements
we made.

797
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:29,376 A:middle
Maybe it was my App
Store presence,

798
00:30:29,686 --> 00:30:31,096 A:middle
but likely it was the
new version of the app

799
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:33,566 A:middle
or new content to the app to get
people to come back and use it,

800
00:30:34,016 --> 00:30:37,526 A:middle
and I have a 60 percent
retention rate two days

801
00:30:37,526 --> 00:30:38,176 A:middle
after June 9.

802
00:30:38,526 --> 00:30:39,756 A:middle
That's how retention works.

803
00:30:40,636 --> 00:30:42,806 A:middle
The easiest way to
understand it is to do a demo.

804
00:30:42,806 --> 00:30:44,126 A:middle
So we are going to
do another demo here.

805
00:30:44,436 --> 00:30:45,676 A:middle
David will walk through
retention.

806
00:30:46,476 --> 00:30:46,866 A:middle
>> DAVID HOPKINS: Great.

807
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:49,286 A:middle
So retention is available
as another tab

808
00:30:49,286 --> 00:30:50,436 A:middle
within the context of your app.

809
00:30:50,596 --> 00:30:53,316 A:middle
We are looking at the retention
for our app Trip Guider.

810
00:30:53,856 --> 00:30:56,236 A:middle
The first thing I'll talk
about is the retention grid,

811
00:30:56,236 --> 00:30:57,426 A:middle
which Trystan introduced.

812
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,876 A:middle
On the left-hand side, you'll
see the purchase date for each

813

814
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

815
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,876 A:middle
On the left-hand side, you'll
see the purchase date for each

816
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:02,386 A:middle
of the last 30 purchase days.

817
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:05,326 A:middle
Next to that, you'll
see a number of devices.

818
00:31:05,326 --> 00:31:07,596 A:middle
That's the number of
devices that installed

819
00:31:07,596 --> 00:31:08,756 A:middle
on that purchase date.

820
00:31:10,066 --> 00:31:12,316 A:middle
On the top of the grid
you'll see a number.

821
00:31:12,316 --> 00:31:14,676 A:middle
That is the number of days
since the purchase date.

822
00:31:14,676 --> 00:31:17,046 A:middle
So when we look at this number
one, it means we are looking

823
00:31:17,046 --> 00:31:18,976 A:middle
at one day after
the purchase date.

824
00:31:19,706 --> 00:31:22,276 A:middle
The easiest way to
understand the retention grid

825
00:31:22,276 --> 00:31:25,286 A:middle
if you are getting lost
is to hover over any cell,

826
00:31:25,286 --> 00:31:26,736 A:middle
and it gives you a
nice explanation.

827
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:29,356 A:middle
So we'll hover over this
32 percent, and it says,

828
00:31:29,836 --> 00:31:32,806 A:middle
"32 percent of the devices
that installed the app

829
00:31:32,806 --> 00:31:35,646 A:middle
on May 13 were active
two days later."

830
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:40,096 A:middle
So oftentimes you'll
hear people talk

831
00:31:40,096 --> 00:31:41,946 A:middle
about their day seven retention.

832
00:31:41,946 --> 00:31:43,716 A:middle
And as an app developer,

833
00:31:43,716 --> 00:31:47,116 A:middle
you know that people will
purchase your app and a lot

834
00:31:47,116 --> 00:31:49,366 A:middle
of times they come back
on day one or day two,

835
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,236 A:middle
but then the usage
starts to fall off.

836
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:54,506 A:middle
We like to measure a day
that is a little further out.

837
00:31:54,576 --> 00:31:56,676 A:middle
That's why day seven
retention is important.

838
00:31:57,326 --> 00:32:00,176 A:middle
We make this easy to see
within App Analytics.

839

840
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

841
00:31:57,326 --> 00:32:00,176 A:middle
We make this easy to see
within App Analytics.

842
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,436 A:middle
All you need to do
is click on the seven

843
00:32:02,436 --> 00:32:05,496 A:middle
and you can see your day
seven retention over time.

844
00:32:05,946 --> 00:32:07,936 A:middle
As the app developer,
your goal should be

845
00:32:07,996 --> 00:32:10,396 A:middle
to keep the users
engaged and try to drive

846
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:12,486 A:middle
up the day seven
retention over time.

847
00:32:12,486 --> 00:32:15,346 A:middle
You can see that we start
out around 18 percent.

848
00:32:15,586 --> 00:32:17,926 A:middle
As time goes on, we are
increasing a little bit,

849
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,676 A:middle
but our goal should be really
to keep our users engaged

850
00:32:20,926 --> 00:32:22,366 A:middle
for day seven and beyond.

851
00:32:22,906 --> 00:32:26,696 A:middle
You can also look at any
single purchase date and look

852
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:28,006 A:middle
at the retention for that date.

853
00:32:28,006 --> 00:32:30,426 A:middle
So, for example, if we want
to look at our retention

854
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:32,716 A:middle
on May 12, we can click on that.

855
00:32:32,716 --> 00:32:36,426 A:middle
You can see in the top left, now
we have a graph of our retention

856
00:32:36,426 --> 00:32:39,016 A:middle
for our users who
purchased on May 12.

857
00:32:39,726 --> 00:32:43,796 A:middle
It starts at around 48
percent on day one and goes

858
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:46,546 A:middle
on as time goes on and
goes to around 8 percent.

859
00:32:46,576 --> 00:32:49,936 A:middle
Again, we want to focus here
on driving up our retention.

860
00:32:51,216 --> 00:32:52,266 A:middle
The last thing I want to point

861
00:32:52,266 --> 00:32:55,056 A:middle
out on the retention view is
the ability to add a filter.

862
00:32:55,496 --> 00:32:58,646 A:middle
Just like you saw on the
metrics view, we can also filter

863
00:32:58,646 --> 00:33:01,026 A:middle
by any dimension and
look at the retention

864

865
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

866
00:32:58,646 --> 00:33:01,026 A:middle
by any dimension and
look at the retention

867
00:33:01,026 --> 00:33:02,546 A:middle
for just that dimension.

868
00:33:02,906 --> 00:33:07,026 A:middle
We can add a filter and
look at just our retention

869
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,076 A:middle
for our users on the iPad.

870
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:10,596 A:middle
Now the retention updates.

871
00:33:11,436 --> 00:33:12,796 A:middle
Great, that's the
end of my demo.

872
00:33:12,796 --> 00:33:14,836 A:middle
I hand it back to
Trystan who will wrap

873
00:33:14,836 --> 00:33:16,206 A:middle
up our session on App Analytics.

874
00:33:17,516 --> 00:33:20,896 A:middle
[Applause]

875
00:33:21,396 --> 00:33:22,556 A:middle
>> TRYSTAN KOSMYNKA:
Great, thank you, David.

876
00:33:22,946 --> 00:33:23,796 A:middle
That was retention.

877
00:33:23,796 --> 00:33:26,426 A:middle
This is answering the question,
are users returning to the app?

878
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,966 A:middle
We covered a lot today,
first thing was the app list.

879
00:33:30,146 --> 00:33:32,266 A:middle
This is bird's eye view
of all of your iOS apps.

880
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:34,086 A:middle
We also support bundles.

881
00:33:34,086 --> 00:33:37,486 A:middle
So we have page views, units,
and sales for app bundles.

882
00:33:37,486 --> 00:33:40,476 A:middle
These are storefront
and sales measures.

883
00:33:41,466 --> 00:33:42,736 A:middle
Next, he covered the overview.

884
00:33:42,876 --> 00:33:44,716 A:middle
This is your app at a glance.

885
00:33:44,796 --> 00:33:45,986 A:middle
All of the measures
are available.

886
00:33:45,986 --> 00:33:47,586 A:middle
There's the nice
retention widget.

887
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,346 A:middle
You have the map as
well as the pie chart

888
00:33:51,386 --> 00:33:54,056 A:middle
for the platforms as well.

889
00:33:54,256 --> 00:33:56,506 A:middle
Metrics, you use this to explore

890
00:33:56,506 --> 00:33:58,216 A:middle
and discover new
trends within your app.

891
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,926 A:middle
You can see the dimensions
are available.

892

893
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

894
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:01,656 A:middle
We have the new metrics as well.

895
00:34:01,986 --> 00:34:03,686 A:middle
We have Paying Users
and Crashes,

896
00:34:03,726 --> 00:34:06,286 A:middle
those are new as of today.

897
00:34:06,476 --> 00:34:08,085 A:middle
Sources answers that
question of,

898
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,396 A:middle
how are customers
finding my app?

899
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:12,676 A:middle
Are they actually turning
into real customers?

900
00:34:12,956 --> 00:34:15,036 A:middle
We have the page views, which
are potential customers.

901
00:34:15,326 --> 00:34:17,976 A:middle
Are they turning into engaged
and purchasing customers?

902
00:34:18,716 --> 00:34:22,306 A:middle
Finally, are customers
returning to your app?

903
00:34:22,306 --> 00:34:23,936 A:middle
We answer this question
with retention.

904
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,956 A:middle
We are excited about
App Analytics.

905
00:34:26,025 --> 00:34:27,906 A:middle
We hope you use it
to build better apps.

906
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,085 A:middle
We hope this conference has
been a great week for you.

907
00:34:30,966 --> 00:34:32,396 A:middle
For more information, look

908
00:34:32,396 --> 00:34:34,886 A:middle
at the App Analytics
Developer Guide and look

909
00:34:34,886 --> 00:34:36,235 A:middle
at the developer forums.

910
00:34:36,676 --> 00:34:40,576 A:middle
We encourage you to talk to the
Evangelist as well, Mark Malone.

911
00:34:40,985 --> 00:34:43,446 A:middle
We will be downstairs
after this in a lab

912
00:34:43,536 --> 00:34:44,485 A:middle
for a short amount of time.

913
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:46,876 A:middle
We also will be available
for Thursday's lab as well.

914
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,846 A:middle
There are a couple
related sessions,

915
00:34:48,906 --> 00:34:50,496 A:middle
Promoting Your App with an IAd.

916
00:34:50,795 --> 00:34:52,226 A:middle
This already aired, so
we encourage you to look

917
00:34:52,226 --> 00:34:55,916 A:middle
on the video afterwards, and
the What's New in iTunes Connect

918
00:34:56,025 --> 00:34:57,136 A:middle
that occurred this morning.

919
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:58,566 A:middle
This is a great session.

920
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:00,926 A:middle
We walked through new
metrics that will be available

921

922
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

923
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:00,926 A:middle
We walked through new
metrics that will be available

924
00:35:00,926 --> 00:35:03,356 A:middle
in the fall for TestFlight,
and there's How

925
00:35:03,426 --> 00:35:05,986 A:middle
to Manage Your Store
Presence as well.

926
00:35:07,776 --> 00:35:10,866 A:middle
The labs again this
afternoon and tomorrow,

927
00:35:11,146 --> 00:35:13,606 A:middle
we will be available, the
analytics team will be there

928
00:35:13,606 --> 00:35:14,456 A:middle
to answer your questions.

929
00:35:14,926 --> 00:35:15,606 A:middle
Have a great week.

930
00:35:15,726 --> 00:35:16,386 A:middle
Thank you very much.

931
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:20,500 A:middle
[Applause]

932
