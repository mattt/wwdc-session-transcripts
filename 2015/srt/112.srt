I'm Debbie Sterling,

to get more girls

sounds kind of corny,

but this mission is really
what gets me up every morning.

24
00:02:16,176 --> 00:02:17,256 A:middle
It's what makes me tick.

25
00:02:17,976 --> 00:02:20,386 A:middle
This mission has led
me to accomplish things

26
00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:23,906 A:middle
that I never thought were
possible before, like standing

27
00:02:23,906 --> 00:02:26,106 A:middle
up here right now onstage

00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:29,166 A:middle

31
00:02:36,046 --> 00:02:40,486 A:middle
And this moment, this is just
one of many crazy, outrageous,

32
00:02:40,596 --> 00:02:43,156 A:middle
audacious goals that
I've set for myself,

33
00:02:43,476 --> 00:02:44,776 A:middle
all in the name of this mission.

34
00:02:45,596 --> 00:02:48,966 A:middle
So I'm going to share
my story with you today,

35
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:52,306 A:middle
and this is really a
story of audacious goals.

36
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:55,546 A:middle
When you dare to be
audacious, amazing,

37
00:02:55,626 --> 00:02:59,376 A:middle
unbelievable things happen,
like a Super Bowl victory,

38
00:02:59,656 --> 00:03:01,676 A:middle
a legal battle with
the Beastie Boys,

a legal battle with
the Beastie Boys,

00:03:02,276 --> 00:03:05,546 A:middle
and a trip to the tattoo
parlor, just to name a few.

43
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:09,826 A:middle
This GoldieBlox has
been a really wild ride,

44
00:03:10,296 --> 00:03:11,516 A:middle
and I've had a lot

45
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:13,206 A:middle
of hard-earned lessons
along the way.

46
00:03:13,646 --> 00:03:15,906 A:middle
But I hope that this story
today that I'm sharing

47
00:03:15,906 --> 00:03:19,086 A:middle
with you will inspire all
of you to be audacious

48
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:20,726 A:middle
for the things that
you believe in.

49
00:03:21,056 --> 00:03:25,036 A:middle
So I'm going to start my
story right at the beginning.

50
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,256 A:middle
This is me when I
was a little girl.

51
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:30,886 A:middle
Come on, you can
say it -- awwwwwww.

52
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:35,846 A:middle
So I grew up in a small
town, went to public school,

53
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,406 A:middle
small-town U.S.A., Lincoln,
Rhode Island, to be exact.

54
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:41,136 A:middle
Any Rhode Islanders in here?

55
00:03:41,426 --> 00:03:42,986 A:middle
Oh, there's like one, yes.

56
00:03:43,876 --> 00:03:48,086 A:middle
So growing up in
Lincoln, Rhode Island,

57
00:03:48,406 --> 00:03:52,416 A:middle
I remember when I had
my first big break,

58
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:56,576 A:middle
and this was I got accepted
into Stanford University.

59
00:03:57,316 --> 00:03:59,776 A:middle
And this was a really
huge deal for me.

60

61
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

62
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:02,506 A:middle
No one from my high school
had ever gotten into Stanford.

63
00:04:02,886 --> 00:04:05,756 A:middle
They announced it on the
loudspeaker, and everyone

64
00:04:05,756 --> 00:04:06,856 A:middle
in the cafeteria clapped.

65
00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:11,406 A:middle
It was a huge deal, and
that day my math teacher,

66
00:04:11,406 --> 00:04:15,236 A:middle
she was my favorite teacher,
pulled me aside and she said,

67
00:04:15,236 --> 00:04:18,116 A:middle
Debbie, what do you plan
on majoring in at Stanford?

68
00:04:18,685 --> 00:04:19,616 A:middle
And I said I didn't know.

69
00:04:20,476 --> 00:04:22,036 A:middle
She said, how about engineering?

70
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:23,996 A:middle
I think you would
love engineering.

71
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:27,406 A:middle
And I swear to God at that
moment I looked at her

72
00:04:27,946 --> 00:04:29,976 A:middle
and I pictured an
old man train driver.

73
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:32,441 A:middle
[Laughter]

74
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:35,906 A:middle
And I really, you know, it's
so funny and it's embarrassing

75
00:04:35,906 --> 00:04:38,506 A:middle
to admit it, but I really had
no idea what engineering was

76
00:04:39,216 --> 00:04:41,576 A:middle
and I was too ashamed
of asking her.

77
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:45,556 A:middle
So I just kind of shrugged my
shoulders and smiled and said,

78
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:47,936 A:middle
sure, Mrs. Verlay,
engineering sounds cool.

79
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,386 A:middle
So I went off to
Stanford, my freshman year,

80
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,906 A:middle
and like most typical college
freshman I had no idea what I

81
00:04:54,906 --> 00:04:55,736 A:middle
wanted to major in.

82
00:04:55,736 --> 00:04:58,026 A:middle
And her voice stuck in my head,

83
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,936 A:middle
that you would excel
in engineering.

84

85
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

86
00:05:00,496 --> 00:05:03,626 A:middle
So I signed up for
Mechanical Engineering 101,

87
00:05:04,126 --> 00:05:07,396 A:middle
and to my surprise I really
fell in love with that class.

88
00:05:08,086 --> 00:05:11,376 A:middle
And so for the first time
in my life I set myself

89
00:05:11,446 --> 00:05:15,826 A:middle
out with an audacious
goal: be an engineer.

90
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,736 A:middle
Now most of you in this
room are probably engineers

91
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,646 A:middle
so this probably doesn't sound
audacious to you whatsoever,

92
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:26,796 A:middle
but for me this was
an unexpected path.

93
00:05:28,376 --> 00:05:32,246 A:middle
Once I got to Stanford, it was
really only a handful of women

94
00:05:32,246 --> 00:05:36,116 A:middle
in my classes, and only
14 percent of women

95
00:05:36,116 --> 00:05:39,526 A:middle
in the U.S. are engineers,
so it's a huge problem.

96
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:40,646 A:middle
And I felt that.

97
00:05:41,486 --> 00:05:45,246 A:middle
Being one of the only girls
in my classes, it would tend

98
00:05:45,246 --> 00:05:47,236 A:middle
to mean that the
professors, when they split us

99
00:05:47,236 --> 00:05:50,596 A:middle
up into group projects, I'd
be the only girl in the group.

100
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:53,476 A:middle
And I could see the
look on the guys' faces

101
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:55,046 A:middle
when they got stuck
with the girl.

102
00:05:55,906 --> 00:05:58,866 A:middle
And in our group
projects, I always felt

103
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:00,426 A:middle
like my ideas were ignored.

104

105
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

106
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:00,426 A:middle
like my ideas were ignored.

107
00:06:01,096 --> 00:06:04,866 A:middle
I felt like I'd compare myself
to the guys in my classes

108
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:07,096 A:middle
and they just seemed so
much smarter than me,

109
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:09,876 A:middle
like they'd been
programming calculators

110
00:06:09,876 --> 00:06:11,116 A:middle
since they were three.

111
00:06:11,576 --> 00:06:14,556 A:middle
Many of you in here
probably did do that.

112
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:19,046 A:middle
And I really, I never felt
good enough or that I belonged.

113
00:06:19,516 --> 00:06:23,516 A:middle
I remember the one day that
I almost gave it up entirely.

114
00:06:24,146 --> 00:06:28,016 A:middle
I had signed up to take an
engineering drawing class.

115
00:06:28,016 --> 00:06:29,986 A:middle
It was a class where you
had to try and draw things

116
00:06:29,986 --> 00:06:31,806 A:middle
in 3D, in perspective.

117
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,096 A:middle
And this class I
was actually excited

118
00:06:34,096 --> 00:06:36,906 A:middle
about because I'd always
loved art and I figured,

119
00:06:36,906 --> 00:06:40,336 A:middle
I'm totally going to ace this,
but when I started getting

120
00:06:40,336 --> 00:06:43,086 A:middle
into the coursework I
struggled with the material.

121
00:06:43,556 --> 00:06:47,266 A:middle
For some reason, for the life
of me I couldn't draw in 3D.

122
00:06:47,886 --> 00:06:50,986 A:middle
I tried really hard, and
I remember our final day

123
00:06:50,986 --> 00:06:53,366 A:middle
of class we had to put
all of our drawings

124
00:06:53,366 --> 00:06:54,856 A:middle
up on the wall for critique.

125
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:58,886 A:middle
And the TAs went around and
they got up to my drawing

126
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:02,096 A:middle
and they looked out to the
room, the entire class,

127

128
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

129
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:02,096 A:middle
and they looked out to the
room, the entire class,

130
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:05,346 A:middle
almost all guys, and they
said, raise your hand

131
00:07:05,346 --> 00:07:07,146 A:middle
if you think Debbie
should pass this class.

132
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:13,526 A:middle
And everyone just kind of
stood there, so awkward,

133
00:07:13,646 --> 00:07:14,876 A:middle
not knowing what to do.

134
00:07:15,456 --> 00:07:18,956 A:middle
And the teachers asked
again, and I turned beet red.

135
00:07:19,116 --> 00:07:20,936 A:middle
Everyone is kind of
shuffling their feet,

136
00:07:20,936 --> 00:07:22,086 A:middle
not knowing what to say.

137
00:07:22,546 --> 00:07:26,626 A:middle
And, finally, my friend, Micah
got up and he stood up for me,

138
00:07:27,216 --> 00:07:31,436 A:middle
and he told those TAs that
they were humiliating me

139
00:07:31,496 --> 00:07:32,626 A:middle
and it was unnecessary.

140
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:35,626 A:middle
That it was their job to teach
me, not to make fun of me.

141
00:07:36,516 --> 00:07:40,386 A:middle
Well, I ran out of that room
and I burst out into tears,

142
00:07:40,756 --> 00:07:42,036 A:middle
and I'm not much of a crier.

143
00:07:42,116 --> 00:07:45,696 A:middle
And at that moment I knew
what they were trying to do.

144
00:07:45,696 --> 00:07:48,416 A:middle
I knew they were trying to
weed me out of the major.

145
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:51,176 A:middle
And the worst part was I
felt like I deserved it.

146
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:55,626 A:middle
But luckily Micah came to
my side and he told me not

147
00:07:55,626 --> 00:07:57,596 A:middle
to give up, he told
me to stick with it.

148
00:07:57,596 --> 00:08:00,026 A:middle
He actually became
an Apple employee,

149

150
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

151
00:07:57,596 --> 00:08:00,026 A:middle
He actually became
an Apple employee,

152
00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:02,876 A:middle
so he's a pretty
smart guy, right?

153

[ Applause ]

154
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:09,316 A:middle
And so I followed his advice
and I did work harder,

155
00:08:09,316 --> 00:08:10,986 A:middle
harder than I'd ever
worked in my life,

156
00:08:11,676 --> 00:08:14,086 A:middle
and I earned my engineering
degree.

157
00:08:15,096 --> 00:08:16,836 A:middle
And on the day that
I graduated ...

158
00:08:17,336 --> 00:08:21,556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

159
00:08:22,056 --> 00:08:23,996 A:middle
... it was really the
proudest day of my life

160
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:27,046 A:middle
because I had set an
audacious goal for myself

161
00:08:27,336 --> 00:08:29,046 A:middle
and I had achieved it.

162
00:08:29,046 --> 00:08:30,966 A:middle
And what made it so
much more meaningful is

163
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:34,836 A:middle
that it wasn't easy for me, and
once I hit it, once I climbed

164
00:08:34,836 --> 00:08:36,486 A:middle
that mountain and I achieved it,

165
00:08:36,756 --> 00:08:38,395 A:middle
I learned something
about myself.

166
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:41,196 A:middle
I learned that I really
was capable all along.

167
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:45,256 A:middle
On the day of my graduation,
it was the same day

168
00:08:45,256 --> 00:08:48,836 A:middle
that Steve Jobs gave his
infamous 2005 commencement

169
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:52,016 A:middle
speech, and that speech
really changed my life.

170
00:08:52,726 --> 00:08:56,836 A:middle
He told us all to never settle,
to keep pushing, to keep going

171
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,636 A:middle
until you find your
true passion,

172
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,686 A:middle
until you can follow your heart.

173

174
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

175
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,686 A:middle
until you can follow your heart.

176
00:09:01,516 --> 00:09:04,746 A:middle
And I sat there on
that day deciding:

177
00:09:04,816 --> 00:09:06,996 A:middle
I'm going to find my passion
and I'm going to follow it,

178
00:09:06,996 --> 00:09:09,356 A:middle
I just don't really
know what it is.

179
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:12,796 A:middle
So I started going out
there trying to find it.

180
00:09:12,796 --> 00:09:14,916 A:middle
I had a bunch of different jobs.

181
00:09:15,216 --> 00:09:16,696 A:middle
I traveled the world.

182
00:09:16,696 --> 00:09:18,406 A:middle
I did volunteer work in India.

183
00:09:18,406 --> 00:09:21,546 A:middle
I was searching and searching,
I've got to follow my heart,

184
00:09:21,546 --> 00:09:24,946 A:middle
I just, again, don't
know what that is.

185
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:27,626 A:middle
Until finally one day it hit me.

186
00:09:28,146 --> 00:09:34,806 A:middle
I've got to get more
girls into engineering.

187
00:09:35,256 --> 00:09:40,946 A:middle
The lack of women in engineering
is a joke, literally.

188
00:09:41,496 --> 00:09:43,556 A:middle
There are memes about it
all over the Internet,

189
00:09:43,556 --> 00:09:48,116 A:middle
and everyone here knows, and I
know, that there are millions

190
00:09:48,116 --> 00:09:50,386 A:middle
of girls out there in the
world who are just like me,

191
00:09:50,386 --> 00:09:53,106 A:middle
who have it in them but
probably won't get lucky enough

192
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:56,176 A:middle
to have a math teacher pull them
aside and encourage them, right?

193
00:09:56,916 --> 00:10:01,376 A:middle
So I started becoming obsessed
with why there are so few girls

194

195
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

196
00:09:56,916 --> 00:10:01,376 A:middle
So I started becoming obsessed
with why there are so few girls

197
00:10:01,516 --> 00:10:04,626 A:middle
and women in engineering and
what I could do to change that.

198
00:10:05,226 --> 00:10:07,896 A:middle
I started talking about
it with everyone I could,

199
00:10:07,896 --> 00:10:10,356 A:middle
and asking them, how did
you get into engineering,

200
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:12,526 A:middle
and why are there so
few women and girls?

201
00:10:13,006 --> 00:10:17,356 A:middle
And I started to hear the same
response over and over again:

202
00:10:17,356 --> 00:10:18,386 A:middle
you can't fight nature.

203
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:22,926 A:middle
Seriously, smart, educated
people would tell me, you know,

204
00:10:23,436 --> 00:10:25,346 A:middle
there are just biological
differences

205
00:10:25,346 --> 00:10:26,456 A:middle
between men and women.

206
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:29,056 A:middle
And they told me, you know,

207
00:10:29,056 --> 00:10:32,906 A:middle
men just are naturally inclined
toward building and engineering,

208
00:10:32,906 --> 00:10:34,586 A:middle
they're just good
at it, you know?

209
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:38,766 A:middle
They've got spatial skills,
they're born to be engineers.

210
00:10:39,536 --> 00:10:40,946 A:middle
Well, this really pissed me off.

211
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:48,226 A:middle
[ Applause ]

212
00:10:48,726 --> 00:10:50,556 A:middle
It did, I mean I got
into engineering,

213
00:10:50,556 --> 00:10:52,906 A:middle
does that make me a freak
of nature or something?

214
00:10:53,756 --> 00:10:57,616 A:middle
So this pissed me off
so much I decided to set

215
00:10:57,696 --> 00:11:02,136 A:middle
out with my next audacious
goal: I'm going to fight nature.

216

217
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

218
00:10:57,696 --> 00:11:02,136 A:middle
out with my next audacious
goal: I'm going to fight nature.

219
00:11:02,676 --> 00:11:04,936 A:middle
You say you can't fight nature,
well, I'm going to fight nature.

220
00:11:05,656 --> 00:11:09,606 A:middle
And what I started to do was
I wanted to get smart on it.

221
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,326 A:middle
Is there any validity to
what these people are saying?

222
00:11:12,386 --> 00:11:13,526 A:middle
I'm going to do my homework.

223
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:17,626 A:middle
So I started doing research
and read every study I could

224
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:18,756 A:middle
on gender differences.

225
00:11:18,756 --> 00:11:21,516 A:middle
I wanted to know the
difference between the sexes,

226
00:11:22,686 --> 00:11:26,196 A:middle
those biological drivers
between men and women.

227
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,066 A:middle
So I read research articles.

228
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:29,646 A:middle
I talked to neuroscientists.

229
00:11:30,076 --> 00:11:32,756 A:middle
I studied cognitive
development in children.

230
00:11:32,756 --> 00:11:35,376 A:middle
I met with engineers,
and parents,

231
00:11:35,376 --> 00:11:36,956 A:middle
and teachers, everybody I could.

232
00:11:37,746 --> 00:11:39,746 A:middle
And I learned some
really interesting things.

233
00:11:40,626 --> 00:11:43,196 A:middle
First, I learned that,
yes, there are differences

234
00:11:43,226 --> 00:11:44,366 A:middle
between men and women.

235
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,616 A:middle
There are differences
between boys and girls.

236
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:50,066 A:middle
For example, I learned if
you give a boy a stick,

237
00:11:50,066 --> 00:11:53,586 A:middle
he will most likely turn it
into a gun and shoot it at you.

238
00:11:54,636 --> 00:11:55,516 A:middle
This is true, actually,

239
00:11:55,516 --> 00:11:57,706 A:middle
my three-year-old
cousin literally did this

240
00:11:57,836 --> 00:11:59,506 A:middle
to me the other day
with my own toys.

241

242
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

243
00:12:00,826 --> 00:12:04,196 A:middle
I also learned that girls
are naturally inclined toward

244
00:12:04,196 --> 00:12:06,706 A:middle
nurturing, in case they
become a mother someday.

245
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:09,826 A:middle
This is why baby dolls
and soft cuddly pets are

246
00:12:09,826 --> 00:12:11,146 A:middle
so popular with girls.

247
00:12:12,236 --> 00:12:14,846 A:middle
I learned that in
preschool classrooms,

248
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,916 A:middle
boys like to compete
mano a mano,

249
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,066 A:middle
man against man,
winner takes all.

250
00:12:20,516 --> 00:12:22,176 A:middle
Whereas girls like situations

251
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:24,996 A:middle
where everybody works
together toward a common goal,

252
00:12:25,026 --> 00:12:26,136 A:middle
where everybody wins.

253
00:12:26,576 --> 00:12:29,926 A:middle
And the way that girls tend to
compete is by excluding others.

254
00:12:30,326 --> 00:12:32,156 A:middle
It's called cliques,
and I have been

255
00:12:32,156 --> 00:12:33,726 A:middle
in a few cliques in my life.

256
00:12:34,996 --> 00:12:37,116 A:middle
And I learned so many
things, but I'll jump ahead

257
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:40,806 A:middle
to really I think the
most important study.

258
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:41,976 A:middle
It was done recently.

259
00:12:41,976 --> 00:12:43,586 A:middle
There was a global test.

260
00:12:44,026 --> 00:12:45,956 A:middle
Around the world they
tested boys and girls

261
00:12:45,956 --> 00:12:47,456 A:middle
on the same exact science test.

262
00:12:48,116 --> 00:12:49,406 A:middle
And what the results showed was

263
00:12:49,406 --> 00:12:53,066 A:middle
that girls actually outperformed
the boys on that test

264
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:54,386 A:middle
in most parts of the world,

265
00:12:54,696 --> 00:12:59,056 A:middle
but not in the U.S. What this
study showed, and many others

266
00:12:59,056 --> 00:13:00,466 A:middle
that have been done
just like it,

267

268
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

269
00:12:59,056 --> 00:13:00,466 A:middle
that have been done
just like it,

270
00:13:00,616 --> 00:13:03,396 A:middle
is that there's actually no
innate intellectual difference

271
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:06,456 A:middle
between boys and girls in
the math and science fields.

272
00:13:07,016 --> 00:13:10,386 A:middle
What the study suggests is
that the problem isn't nature,

273
00:13:11,246 --> 00:13:13,536 A:middle
the problem is actually culture.

274
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:17,726 A:middle
And from a young age, girls
and boys when they look

275
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:20,816 A:middle
at the world they see
engineering as a boys' club.

276
00:13:21,316 --> 00:13:26,366 A:middle
You've got Handy Manny; Bob the
Builder; Sid the Science Kid;

277
00:13:26,566 --> 00:13:32,786 A:middle
Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius;
Bill Nye, the Science Guy.

278
00:13:32,786 --> 00:13:35,226 A:middle
From a young age this
is what kids believe,

279
00:13:35,796 --> 00:13:37,696 A:middle
these are the builders, right?

280
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:41,936 A:middle
And what's even worse is
when you look at the world

281
00:13:42,006 --> 00:13:45,686 A:middle
through the eyes of a kid
it's very clear that dolls are

282
00:13:45,686 --> 00:13:48,046 A:middle
for girls and building
is for boys.

283
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:52,416 A:middle
Take a walk down the pink
aisle and there's princesses,

284
00:13:52,546 --> 00:14:00,056 A:middle
Barbie Dolls, fashion, literally
ironing boards today in 2015.

285

286
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

287
00:13:52,546 --> 00:14:00,056 A:middle
Barbie Dolls, fashion, literally
ironing boards today in 2015.

288
00:14:00,356 --> 00:14:04,096 A:middle
It's like we're back in the
1950s, and all the products

289
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:07,226 A:middle
and characters for girls
tell girls that beauty

290
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:09,226 A:middle
above all is what's important.

291
00:14:10,186 --> 00:14:11,596 A:middle
Meanwhile, the blue aisle

292
00:14:11,596 --> 00:14:15,856 A:middle
for boys has the awesome super
heroes and action figures

293
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:18,766 A:middle
and brainteasers and
construction sets.

294
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,886 A:middle
Those things really help
develop an interest in science

295
00:14:21,886 --> 00:14:23,716 A:middle
and technology, engineering
and math,

296
00:14:23,716 --> 00:14:25,696 A:middle
develop spatial skills,
tinkering.

297
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:30,976 A:middle
So I was in this very pink
aisle four years ago and I felt

298
00:14:30,976 --> 00:14:32,646 A:middle
like I was in the Twilight Zone.

299
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:35,986 A:middle
And at that instant
I just knew in my gut

300
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:38,796 A:middle
that this was my
opportunity to change it.

301
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:41,556 A:middle
So I came up with an obsession.

302
00:14:42,456 --> 00:14:45,666 A:middle
I'm going to invent an
engineering toy for girls.

303
00:14:47,276 --> 00:14:50,096 A:middle
I left the store that
day, filled up a cart

304
00:14:50,096 --> 00:14:52,826 A:middle
with as many toys as I could
and I decided, all right,

305
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:54,096 A:middle
I'm going to start
doing research,

306
00:14:54,096 --> 00:14:55,086 A:middle
get to the bottom of this.

307
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:57,666 A:middle
How can I get girls into
building and construction?

308
00:14:58,316 --> 00:15:00,786 A:middle
I went around, begged my
friends, please, please,

309

310
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

311
00:14:58,316 --> 00:15:00,786 A:middle
I went around, begged my
friends, please, please,

312
00:15:00,786 --> 00:15:03,196 A:middle
please let me babysit your kids.

313
00:15:03,556 --> 00:15:04,856 A:middle
They were like, all right.

314
00:15:05,526 --> 00:15:08,296 A:middle
But I needed even more
kids, people I didn't know.

315
00:15:08,296 --> 00:15:12,036 A:middle
I was searching and searching,
how do I find kids to test on?

316
00:15:12,206 --> 00:15:16,656 A:middle
I even posted -- I posted
an ad on Craigslist.

317
00:15:17,636 --> 00:15:22,636 A:middle
I did. It said free childcare
for girls four to nine.

318
00:15:25,276 --> 00:15:28,806 A:middle
And I didn't realize it
sounded so creepy, right?

319
00:15:30,056 --> 00:15:31,856 A:middle
My husband was like, thank
God you're not trying

320
00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:34,126 A:middle
to start a babysitting
company, what's wrong with you?

321
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:37,916 A:middle
And only one person
replied, this French woman,

322
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,586 A:middle
who I think it got lost in
translation or something.

323
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:42,016 A:middle
She must have been
like, America,

324
00:15:42,016 --> 00:15:43,576 A:middle
the greatest place in the world!

325
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,976 A:middle
But I actually went to her house
and I babysat her daughter.

326
00:15:47,396 --> 00:15:51,376 A:middle
And through all of this time
I spent with kids I started

327
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:52,596 A:middle
to notice some patterns.

328
00:15:53,016 --> 00:15:55,386 A:middle
I noticed that boys
would build for the sake

329
00:15:55,386 --> 00:15:56,856 A:middle
of building all day long.

330
00:15:56,986 --> 00:15:59,686 A:middle
They would build it
up and smash it down

331
00:15:59,906 --> 00:16:00,886 A:middle
and do it again and again.

332

333
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

334
00:15:59,906 --> 00:16:00,886 A:middle
and do it again and again.

335
00:16:01,596 --> 00:16:04,616 A:middle
I noticed that the girls
really liked stories

336
00:16:04,616 --> 00:16:06,856 A:middle
and characters, they
liked narrative.

337
00:16:06,926 --> 00:16:09,216 A:middle
They didn't just want to
build, but they'd want

338
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,326 A:middle
to build something
for a purpose, like,

339
00:16:11,326 --> 00:16:14,306 A:middle
why are we building it and who
is it for, and who is it going

340
00:16:14,366 --> 00:16:17,426 A:middle
to help, and where is it, and
what's the story behind it?

341
00:16:18,316 --> 00:16:23,106 A:middle
And so all of this research
kind of led me to an "aha" way

342
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:24,596 A:middle
to engage girls in building.

343
00:16:25,726 --> 00:16:28,046 A:middle
It was a really simple
idea, but I thought,

344
00:16:28,046 --> 00:16:30,816 A:middle
what if I combined
building with a story?

345
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:35,606 A:middle
I came up with this
character that I invented,

346
00:16:35,606 --> 00:16:38,826 A:middle
named GoldieBlox, and she
would be the girl builder,

347
00:16:38,826 --> 00:16:39,826 A:middle
a girl engineer.

348
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,836 A:middle
And she'd go on adventures
and have to solve problems

349
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,306 A:middle
by building contraptions.

350
00:16:44,616 --> 00:16:48,496 A:middle
And I thought if girls thought
she was cool and they wanted

351
00:16:48,496 --> 00:16:50,426 A:middle
to be like her and
do what she does,

352
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,916 A:middle
then maybe that would
get them to build, too,

353
00:16:53,226 --> 00:16:54,696 A:middle
and maybe the little machines

354
00:16:54,696 --> 00:16:57,596 A:middle
that they build can teach
them engineering principles

355
00:16:57,596 --> 00:16:59,666 A:middle
and help solve problems,
give that context

356
00:16:59,996 --> 00:17:01,236 A:middle
that girls were looking for.

357

358
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

359
00:16:59,996 --> 00:17:01,236 A:middle
that girls were looking for.

360
00:17:01,776 --> 00:17:05,876 A:middle
So this was my genius idea,
this engineering toy for girls.

361
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:09,685 A:middle
And I became so obsessed
with it,

362
00:17:09,685 --> 00:17:14,496 A:middle
it led me to my next audacious
goal: build a startup.

363
00:17:15,846 --> 00:17:19,715 A:middle
So at the time when I came
up with this engineering toy

364
00:17:19,715 --> 00:17:21,715 A:middle
for girls, I was working

365
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:25,776 A:middle
at a pretty cushy nine-to-five
job, steady paycheck.

366
00:17:26,396 --> 00:17:28,286 A:middle
And, in fact, ever
since I was old enough

367
00:17:28,356 --> 00:17:31,126 A:middle
to work I always had
a job, so the thought

368
00:17:31,126 --> 00:17:33,726 A:middle
of actually leaving it and
starting out on my own,

369
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:35,336 A:middle
it was pretty terrifying.

370
00:17:36,006 --> 00:17:38,666 A:middle
But it got to the point
where I was so obsessed

371
00:17:38,836 --> 00:17:40,746 A:middle
with GoldieBlox it was
all I could think about,

372
00:17:40,746 --> 00:17:43,916 A:middle
all I could talk about,
it got to the point

373
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:44,996 A:middle
where it didn't feel
like a choice,

374
00:17:44,996 --> 00:17:48,046 A:middle
it felt like it was
just what I had to do.

375
00:17:48,696 --> 00:17:52,736 A:middle
So I decided to give myself one
year, I'm going to go for it.

376
00:17:52,876 --> 00:17:56,166 A:middle
I have enough money in my bank
account that if by the end

377
00:17:56,166 --> 00:18:00,136 A:middle
of one year this doesn't work
out, then I can always just go

378

379
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

380
00:17:56,166 --> 00:18:00,136 A:middle
of one year this doesn't work
out, then I can always just go

381
00:18:00,136 --> 00:18:01,346 A:middle
and get another job, right?

382
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:05,866 A:middle
And even if I fail at the end
of the year, am I ever going

383
00:18:05,866 --> 00:18:08,176 A:middle
to be ashamed for telling
people that I tried

384
00:18:08,176 --> 00:18:09,836 A:middle
to get girls into engineering?

385
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:13,596 A:middle
No, so I went for it.

386
00:18:14,896 --> 00:18:18,456 A:middle
This is a picture of
me on the first day

387
00:18:18,456 --> 00:18:21,966 A:middle
of starting my dream job on
the floor of my apartment,

388
00:18:23,226 --> 00:18:25,006 A:middle
and I spent hours and hours.

389
00:18:25,006 --> 00:18:27,336 A:middle
I had this image in my head.

390
00:18:27,336 --> 00:18:30,626 A:middle
And I needed to be like the
mad scientist, and I needed

391
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:32,276 A:middle
to labor away until I came

392
00:18:32,276 --> 00:18:34,956 A:middle
up with this brilliant
masterpiece invention.

393
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:40,256 A:middle
I was so paranoid that
somebody might steal my idea

394
00:18:40,876 --> 00:18:45,366 A:middle
that I made anyone who came
anywhere near my prototype sign

395
00:18:45,366 --> 00:18:46,206 A:middle
an NDA.

396
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:50,646 A:middle
I even made my mom sign an NDA.

397
00:18:51,736 --> 00:18:53,096 A:middle
And I worked and worked on this.

398
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:55,296 A:middle
I was drawing pictures of
Goldie, what she might look

399
00:18:55,296 --> 00:18:58,476 A:middle
like building machines,
using thread spools and clay,

400
00:18:58,476 --> 00:19:00,526 A:middle
stuff around the house,
the hardware store,

401

402
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

403
00:18:58,476 --> 00:19:00,526 A:middle
stuff around the house,
the hardware store,

404
00:19:00,816 --> 00:19:02,826 A:middle
until finally I had
a working prototype.

405
00:19:02,936 --> 00:19:06,906 A:middle
And it was the ugliest
thing you have ever seen,

406
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:08,836 A:middle
but it worked and I was excited.

407
00:19:08,836 --> 00:19:12,596 A:middle
And so I finally decided I'm
going to take this prototype

408
00:19:12,596 --> 00:19:14,406 A:middle
to the New York Toy
Fair and I'm going

409
00:19:14,406 --> 00:19:17,256 A:middle
to see what the industry
has to say.

410
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:22,416 A:middle
So I went to the show with my
prototype and a badge I managed

411
00:19:22,516 --> 00:19:25,486 A:middle
to finagle, pretty
much snuck in,

412
00:19:25,486 --> 00:19:27,496 A:middle
and a giant stack
of NDAs, of course.

413
00:19:28,576 --> 00:19:31,096 A:middle
And started walking
around booth to booth,

414
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:33,806 A:middle
talking with everyone I
could, toy store owners,

415
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,996 A:middle
toy executives, other
toy inventors to try

416
00:19:37,996 --> 00:19:40,946 A:middle
to get their feedback on what
they thought of my genius idea,

417
00:19:41,366 --> 00:19:42,796 A:middle
the engineering toy for girls.

418
00:19:43,586 --> 00:19:47,326 A:middle
Well, the response
was pretty unanimous,

419
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:50,066 A:middle
you can't fight nature.

420
00:19:50,776 --> 00:19:55,596 A:middle
Again, these people, they
told me that girls like dolls

421
00:19:55,996 --> 00:19:57,056 A:middle
and boys like building,

422
00:19:57,486 --> 00:20:00,136 A:middle
that a construction toy
for girls won't sell.

423

424
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

425
00:19:57,486 --> 00:20:00,136 A:middle
that a construction toy
for girls won't sell.

426
00:20:00,646 --> 00:20:03,476 A:middle
They actually took me
by the arm and walked me

427
00:20:03,476 --> 00:20:05,486 A:middle
down the pink aisle
of the trade show

428
00:20:05,976 --> 00:20:07,736 A:middle
where we had the ironing boards

429
00:20:07,736 --> 00:20:09,406 A:middle
and the fashion dolls
and the tea sets.

430
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:11,396 A:middle
They said this is
what girls want,

431
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:14,876 A:middle
girls want to be princesses,
they don't want to be engineers.

432
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,256 A:middle
They said maybe if you're
lucky you can license your idea

433
00:20:19,336 --> 00:20:22,986 A:middle
to some little educational
toy reseller

434
00:20:22,986 --> 00:20:25,266 A:middle
who maybe can convince
a school to put it in,

435
00:20:26,186 --> 00:20:28,356 A:middle
but starting your own company,

436
00:20:28,746 --> 00:20:30,846 A:middle
trying to make this
go mainstream,

437
00:20:31,216 --> 00:20:34,496 A:middle
it's an uphill battle and
you're never going to win it.

438
00:20:34,686 --> 00:20:36,986 A:middle
So I left the show
pretty dejected

439
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,406 A:middle
because at this point
I'd quit my job,

440
00:20:39,786 --> 00:20:44,016 A:middle
I was going off my life's
savings, and I was worried,

441
00:20:44,196 --> 00:20:46,166 A:middle
what if they're right,
am I crazy?

442
00:20:46,986 --> 00:20:49,586 A:middle
So after the show was
over, I signed up to go

443
00:20:49,586 --> 00:20:51,706 A:middle
to this social entrepreneur
conference called

444
00:20:51,806 --> 00:20:52,366 A:middle
Starting Block.

445
00:20:52,846 --> 00:20:54,626 A:middle
It was a group of
100 young people

446
00:20:54,626 --> 00:20:55,926 A:middle
who wanted to change the world.

447
00:20:56,646 --> 00:21:00,286 A:middle
Now I was feeling pretty
dejected after Toy Fair and,

448

449
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

450
00:20:56,646 --> 00:21:00,286 A:middle
Now I was feeling pretty
dejected after Toy Fair and,

451
00:21:00,336 --> 00:21:02,626 A:middle
honestly, I wasn't
really in the mood to go

452
00:21:02,626 --> 00:21:05,476 A:middle
and do more networking, but
I had already signed up,

453
00:21:05,476 --> 00:21:08,016 A:middle
I already paid, so
I went anyway.

454
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,676 A:middle
And in that session, one

455
00:21:09,676 --> 00:21:12,636 A:middle
of the first exercises they
had us do was make all of us go

456
00:21:12,636 --> 00:21:13,996 A:middle
up in front of the entire room

457
00:21:13,996 --> 00:21:16,416 A:middle
and tell people what
we were working on,

458
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,586 A:middle
what we were passionate about.

459
00:21:18,006 --> 00:21:22,166 A:middle
Well, I was still so paranoid I
asked the conference organizers

460
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:25,296 A:middle
if I could have all 100
attendees sign an NDA.

461
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:31,266 A:middle
And they're like, no, no,
no, that's not possible,

462
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:33,546 A:middle
you just get up there and
do it anyway for God's sake.

463
00:21:33,936 --> 00:21:36,096 A:middle
So I went up in front
of the room

464
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:40,346 A:middle
and for the first time ever,
I told the story and the idea

465
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:44,396 A:middle
of GoldieBlox publicly,
and the room exploded.

466
00:21:45,056 --> 00:21:48,016 A:middle
People got to their feet
in standing ovation.

467
00:21:48,806 --> 00:21:50,496 A:middle
They formed a line around me

468
00:21:50,656 --> 00:21:52,246 A:middle
and everybody wanted
to be a part of it.

469
00:21:52,246 --> 00:21:53,676 A:middle
They wanted to know
how they could help.

470
00:21:53,676 --> 00:21:57,716 A:middle
At that conference I
learned a bunch of things

471
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:02,106 A:middle
about entrepreneurship, but
two lessons really stand out.

472

473
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

474
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:02,106 A:middle
about entrepreneurship, but
two lessons really stand out.

475
00:22:02,216 --> 00:22:06,156 A:middle
The first one that I learned was
this idea called creating your

476
00:22:06,156 --> 00:22:06,526 A:middle
own luck.

477
00:22:07,716 --> 00:22:11,416 A:middle
One of the conference organizers
got up and told his story

478
00:22:11,626 --> 00:22:14,106 A:middle
about how he went
after his dream job.

479
00:22:14,726 --> 00:22:16,886 A:middle
He knew what organization
he wanted to work at,

480
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:18,596 A:middle
but he didn't have
any connections there.

481
00:22:19,306 --> 00:22:23,526 A:middle
So he started cold emailing,
coming up with every first

482
00:22:23,526 --> 00:22:26,776 A:middle
and last name combination
he possibly could of someone

483
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:28,876 A:middle
at the company, like B.

484
00:22:28,986 --> 00:22:31,796 A:middle
Smith at company
dot com, Brandon S.

485
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:35,566 A:middle
at company dot com, emailing
every combination he could,

486
00:22:36,506 --> 00:22:37,256 A:middle
got no response.

487
00:22:37,706 --> 00:22:40,166 A:middle
So he did it again a week later,

488
00:22:40,336 --> 00:22:43,496 A:middle
every combo he could possibly
think of, no response.

489
00:22:44,306 --> 00:22:46,426 A:middle
Did it again a week later.

490
00:22:47,226 --> 00:22:50,206 A:middle
Finally, a woman wrote
him back begging him

491
00:22:50,206 --> 00:22:53,856 A:middle
to stopmailing everyone, and
she said, fine, I will meet you

492
00:22:53,856 --> 00:22:55,936 A:middle
at a coffee shop for
an informal interview.

493
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:57,586 A:middle
He got the job.

494
00:22:58,116 --> 00:23:01,086 A:middle
He didn't just sit around
waiting for luck to come to him.

495

496
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

497
00:22:58,116 --> 00:23:01,086 A:middle
He didn't just sit around
waiting for luck to come to him.

498
00:23:01,086 --> 00:23:04,746 A:middle
He went out and got it, even
as shamelessly as he did so.

499
00:23:05,126 --> 00:23:08,856 A:middle
The next lesson I learned
was about the difference

500
00:23:08,856 --> 00:23:11,526 A:middle
between being an inventor
and an entrepreneur.

501
00:23:12,466 --> 00:23:15,486 A:middle
I learned that an inventor
is somebody who holes up,

502
00:23:15,866 --> 00:23:18,476 A:middle
working on their ideas
all alone in isolation,

503
00:23:18,476 --> 00:23:20,566 A:middle
trying to perfect
something all by themselves,

504
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:24,666 A:middle
but an entrepreneur is somebody
who really puts themselves

505
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:27,556 A:middle
out there, tells as
many people as they can

506
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:29,766 A:middle
about what they're passionate
about, what they're working on,

507
00:23:30,016 --> 00:23:33,036 A:middle
and builds a community around
them to be a part of it.

508
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,496 A:middle
And I realized that all
along I'd been acting

509
00:23:35,496 --> 00:23:38,196 A:middle
like an inventor, I
was a total hermit,

510
00:23:38,196 --> 00:23:40,156 A:middle
and that was lonely, too.

511
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:44,776 A:middle
And now I had this whole group
of people who believed in me

512
00:23:44,876 --> 00:23:47,526 A:middle
and believed in GoldieBlox,
who wanted to be a part of it,

513
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:51,486 A:middle
and not only that could
actually help make it better.

514
00:23:51,486 --> 00:23:54,796 A:middle
So from that day forward
my whole view shifted.

515
00:23:54,796 --> 00:23:59,706 A:middle
After I left the conference,
the people there started showing

516
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:01,466 A:middle
up in my apartment every day,

517

518
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

519
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:01,466 A:middle
up in my apartment every day,

520
00:24:01,746 --> 00:24:03,326 A:middle
and they started
bringing their friends,

521
00:24:03,746 --> 00:24:05,566 A:middle
and their friends
brought their friends.

522
00:24:06,116 --> 00:24:08,806 A:middle
And this group of passionate
people gave me the energy

523
00:24:08,806 --> 00:24:10,376 A:middle
that I needed to
get excited again,

524
00:24:10,506 --> 00:24:12,976 A:middle
and we started building
prototypes

525
00:24:12,976 --> 00:24:14,396 A:middle
and encouraging each other.

526
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:18,086 A:middle
We even started a blog
where we'd write stories

527
00:24:18,086 --> 00:24:19,426 A:middle
about what we were
learning and the challenges

528
00:24:19,576 --> 00:24:22,146 A:middle
that we were facing, and we'd
share it with all our friends

529
00:24:22,146 --> 00:24:24,146 A:middle
and family and find
more people to help.

530
00:24:25,496 --> 00:24:28,226 A:middle
And with the help of
this crew of people,

531
00:24:28,756 --> 00:24:31,476 A:middle
we built GoldieBlox
prototypes and took them all

532
00:24:31,476 --> 00:24:34,206 A:middle
around the Bay area, into
people's homes and schools,

533
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:37,336 A:middle
to Maker Faire to
test it on kids.

534
00:24:37,926 --> 00:24:40,926 A:middle
It was a process of rapid
prototyping, and the great thing

535
00:24:40,926 --> 00:24:44,276 A:middle
about it is since we had no
money we didn't get too married

536
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:46,826 A:middle
to any one idea, we just
put it out in front of kids

537
00:24:46,826 --> 00:24:47,806 A:middle
and see what they thought.

538
00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:50,446 A:middle
We just really wanted to
know what was going to work

539
00:24:50,446 --> 00:24:52,096 A:middle
with the girls, what
they wanted.

540
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:54,306 A:middle
And, finally, after
months and months

541
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:57,156 A:middle
of testing we had a product
that I really believed in.

542
00:24:58,386 --> 00:25:01,416 A:middle
This was our first toy,
it's called GoldieBlox

543

544
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

545
00:24:58,386 --> 00:25:01,416 A:middle
This was our first toy,
it's called GoldieBlox

546
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,646 A:middle
and the Spinning Machine.

547
00:25:03,206 --> 00:25:07,586 A:middle
In it we have our story, a book
about Goldie and her dog, Nacho,

548
00:25:07,936 --> 00:25:09,346 A:middle
who is always chasing his tail.

549
00:25:09,996 --> 00:25:12,336 A:middle
So Goldie decides, I'm
going to spin Nacho.

550
00:25:12,806 --> 00:25:16,036 A:middle
By using a wheel and an axle,
she builds a spinning machine.

551
00:25:16,956 --> 00:25:20,326 A:middle
But soon her other animal
friends want to spin, too.

552
00:25:20,736 --> 00:25:22,486 A:middle
So Goldie invents a belt drive

553
00:25:22,826 --> 00:25:24,956 A:middle
where she gets everybody
spinning all at once.

554
00:25:26,296 --> 00:25:28,836 A:middle
This product, you know,
as simple as it sounds,

555
00:25:29,116 --> 00:25:30,636 A:middle
really did engage
the little girls.

556
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:35,066 A:middle
I had girls in tutus pounding
their fists on the table,

557
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,716 A:middle
we have to have everybody spin!

558
00:25:38,356 --> 00:25:40,236 A:middle
So it works.

559
00:25:40,576 --> 00:25:44,256 A:middle
And it was back to all of
the research that I had done,

560
00:25:44,466 --> 00:25:46,346 A:middle
creating the scenarios
where everybody wins,

561
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:48,416 A:middle
engaging with story,
having nurturing,

562
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:49,816 A:middle
having pets and characters.

563
00:25:50,256 --> 00:25:54,856 A:middle
I knew it worked, but the
problem was I knew not a single

564
00:25:54,856 --> 00:25:57,566 A:middle
toy store was going to buy
it because they didn't think

565
00:25:57,566 --> 00:25:58,666 A:middle
that girls like building.

566
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:02,936 A:middle
Also, I only had $2,000
left in my bank account

567

568
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

569
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:02,936 A:middle
Also, I only had $2,000
left in my bank account

570
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:06,176 A:middle
so that was not good
either, and in order

571
00:26:06,176 --> 00:26:10,256 A:middle
to actually produce
GoldieBlox I needed $150,000

572
00:26:10,566 --> 00:26:12,186 A:middle
for a first manufacturing run.

573
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:16,316 A:middle
So I had to set out with
my next audacious goal,

574
00:26:18,156 --> 00:26:19,686 A:middle
Kickstart a movement.

575
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:24,226 A:middle
I decided if the toy store
owners weren't going to buy it,

576
00:26:24,226 --> 00:26:27,176 A:middle
I was going to need to
crowdfund it and prove

577
00:26:27,176 --> 00:26:28,116 A:middle
that there was market demand.

578
00:26:29,446 --> 00:26:31,986 A:middle
So as everyone knows
with Kickstarter,

579
00:26:32,126 --> 00:26:36,706 A:middle
in order to crush it you need
an amazing video, and so I got

580
00:26:36,776 --> 00:26:40,236 A:middle
to work plotting out
the perfect video plan.

581
00:26:41,246 --> 00:26:42,726 A:middle
First, I convinced a friend

582
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,316 A:middle
to let me use his
beautiful workshop, you know,

583
00:26:45,316 --> 00:26:46,636 A:middle
make it seem really cool.

584
00:26:47,186 --> 00:26:49,126 A:middle
Then I convinced my husband,

585
00:26:49,126 --> 00:26:50,966 A:middle
who owned a video
production company,

586
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:54,436 A:middle
to use all of their best --

587
00:26:54,646 --> 00:27:00,946 A:middle
I know it's like kind of a
helpful think I know, I know,

588

589
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

590
00:26:54,646 --> 00:27:00,946 A:middle
I know it's like kind of a
helpful think I know, I know,

591
00:27:00,946 --> 00:27:02,736 A:middle
I know -- but convince
him to film this video

592
00:27:02,736 --> 00:27:06,106 A:middle
with the best equipment,
lighting, camera people.

593
00:27:06,686 --> 00:27:08,996 A:middle
And I memorized this
perfect script,

594
00:27:09,406 --> 00:27:10,896 A:middle
the whole thing memorized.

595
00:27:11,536 --> 00:27:14,996 A:middle
Got my hair done, my makeup,
went out and bought a new dress.

596
00:27:15,746 --> 00:27:18,666 A:middle
I was all set, ready to
go, and brought in all

597
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:20,216 A:middle
of these people to come help.

598
00:27:20,386 --> 00:27:24,666 A:middle
We filmed the video and
we were right on time,

599
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:26,516 A:middle
we were about to
launch the campaign

600
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:28,116 A:middle
in a week, everything was set.

601
00:27:28,636 --> 00:27:31,886 A:middle
And then the film crew sent
me the first cut of the video

602
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:40,256 A:middle
and my heart sank, it was
too good, it felt staged,

603
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,806 A:middle
it just didn't feel like
me, it wasn't genuine.

604
00:27:43,426 --> 00:27:46,626 A:middle
You see, when I tell people
face to face about my passion

605
00:27:46,626 --> 00:27:49,656 A:middle
for GoldieBlox, they get it and
they believe it and they want

606
00:27:49,656 --> 00:27:51,576 A:middle
to be a part of it,
but this video was

607
00:27:51,576 --> 00:27:55,066 A:middle
so overdone it just wasn't
reading, it didn't feel natural.

608
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:59,146 A:middle
And so even though we only had
a couple days left before the

609
00:27:59,146 --> 00:28:01,646 A:middle
Kickstarter was going to
go live, and even though

610

611
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

612
00:27:59,146 --> 00:28:01,646 A:middle
Kickstarter was going to
go live, and even though

613
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:04,096 A:middle
so many people had
helped me make this video

614
00:28:04,096 --> 00:28:05,986 A:middle
and I felt really bad, I had

615
00:28:05,986 --> 00:28:09,416 A:middle
to scrap the whole thing,
I had to reshoot it.

616
00:28:10,216 --> 00:28:13,106 A:middle
Literally, we had two days left,
on the floor of my apartment.

617
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:17,536 A:middle
And in order to get
comfortable enough to be myself

618
00:28:17,676 --> 00:28:20,456 A:middle
when a video camera was
staring at me six inches away

619
00:28:20,506 --> 00:28:23,216 A:middle
from my face I had to
drink three-quarters

620
00:28:23,216 --> 00:28:23,976 A:middle
of a bottle of wine.

621
00:28:24,516 --> 00:28:29,896 A:middle
[ Applause ]

622
00:28:30,396 --> 00:28:33,306 A:middle
Actually, I just did that
backstage -- no, just kidding.

623
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:38,956 A:middle
But finally after hundreds of
takes, no script, I just spoke

624
00:28:38,956 --> 00:28:41,296 A:middle
from the heart, and that
was actually the footage

625
00:28:41,296 --> 00:28:44,556 A:middle
that we used once we cut out
all of the slurring parts.

626
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,586 A:middle
Next order of business,
we had the video

627
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,556 A:middle
and now we needed the support.

628
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:55,346 A:middle
In true create your
own luck form,

629
00:28:55,786 --> 00:28:59,486 A:middle
we created this serial
killer-style list of all

630
00:28:59,486 --> 00:29:02,336 A:middle
of the people that we knew
we had to let them know

631

632
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

633
00:28:59,486 --> 00:29:02,336 A:middle
of the people that we knew
we had to let them know

634
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,986 A:middle
about GoldieBlox in hopes
that they would share it --

635
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:08,286 A:middle
celebrities, journalists,
people with big audiences,

636
00:29:08,286 --> 00:29:12,296 A:middle
everyone we could who we thought
could help get the word out.

637
00:29:12,996 --> 00:29:15,666 A:middle
And then we started mapping
them, who are these people,

638
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:16,596 A:middle
how can we get to them?

639
00:29:16,596 --> 00:29:18,236 A:middle
Does someone know
someone who knows someone

640
00:29:18,236 --> 00:29:21,086 A:middle
who can get to Hillary Clinton?

641
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:24,536 A:middle
And we maniacally
schemed and plotted.

642
00:29:25,066 --> 00:29:27,996 A:middle
One of the people on this
list was Tim Schafer,

643
00:29:28,796 --> 00:29:30,956 A:middle
and I'll just tell the story
of how I got a hold of him.

644
00:29:31,406 --> 00:29:33,926 A:middle
He was one of many
examples of the people

645
00:29:33,926 --> 00:29:35,336 A:middle
who we relentlessly stalked.

646
00:29:36,156 --> 00:29:38,986 A:middle
So after stalking Tim I found --

647
00:29:39,216 --> 00:29:40,846 A:middle
and Tim, for those of
you who don't know,

648
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:43,936 A:middle
legendary videogame designer
and Kickstarter celebrity.

649
00:29:44,556 --> 00:29:49,986 A:middle
After stalking him, I found
out that we used the same bank,

650
00:29:50,076 --> 00:29:55,426 A:middle
so I emailed my banker and
sat down with him for a cup

651
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:57,856 A:middle
of coffee and kind of just
sort of brought it up,

652
00:29:57,856 --> 00:29:59,176 A:middle
and he was like, oh,
you should meet Tim.

653
00:29:59,436 --> 00:30:01,576 A:middle
I'm like, yes, yes,
I'd love to meet Tim.

654

655
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

656
00:29:59,436 --> 00:30:01,576 A:middle
I'm like, yes, yes,
I'd love to meet Tim.

657
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:03,766 A:middle
And before I knew it,

658
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:05,996 A:middle
I'm hanging out at the
office of Double Fine.

659
00:30:06,676 --> 00:30:10,496 A:middle
And it turns out Tim had a
daughter, and he was interested

660
00:30:10,496 --> 00:30:11,426 A:middle
in what we were doing.

661
00:30:11,996 --> 00:30:15,596 A:middle
So I made the ask, I said,
Tim, would you be willing

662
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:18,046 A:middle
to let me film you playing
GoldieBlox with your daughter?

663
00:30:18,636 --> 00:30:19,436 A:middle
And he said, sure.

664
00:30:20,346 --> 00:30:23,246 A:middle
So we got them together, filmed
them playing for the first time,

665
00:30:23,246 --> 00:30:26,096 A:middle
and it was really magical
because she loved it and it was

666
00:30:26,136 --> 00:30:27,566 A:middle
so cute seeing them
play it together.

667
00:30:27,596 --> 00:30:29,746 A:middle
It was really a genuine
moment, and we actually put it

668
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:30,836 A:middle
in our video as a cameo.

669
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:36,386 A:middle
And the day that the Kickstarter
went live, it exploded.

670
00:30:36,786 --> 00:30:40,766 A:middle
First, Tim Schafer tweeted it to
his 90,000 Kickstarter backers.

671
00:30:41,816 --> 00:30:45,466 A:middle
Then, as it turned out,
reporters from TechCrunch

672
00:30:45,466 --> 00:30:48,676 A:middle
and The Atlantic had been
reading my blog the whole time,

673
00:30:48,976 --> 00:30:51,866 A:middle
and so when our campaign
went live they wrote articles

674
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:53,126 A:middle
about it.

675
00:30:53,286 --> 00:30:57,786 A:middle
Our goal of raising $150,000,
we reached it in only four days.

676
00:30:58,326 --> 00:31:00,076 A:middle
A friend of mine who
works at Facebook sent it

677

678
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

679
00:30:58,326 --> 00:31:00,076 A:middle
A friend of mine who
works at Facebook sent it

680
00:31:00,076 --> 00:31:02,556 A:middle
to Sheryl Sandberg, and
she became a backer.

681
00:31:03,126 --> 00:31:06,796 A:middle
My aunt knew someone who knew
someone, who knew Craig Newmark

682
00:31:06,796 --> 00:31:10,176 A:middle
of Craigslist, he backed
it and he tweeted it.

683
00:31:10,606 --> 00:31:15,266 A:middle
So it just totally exploded,
and the craziest thing is

684
00:31:15,266 --> 00:31:17,416 A:middle
that Upworthy posted the video,

685
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:21,076 A:middle
and it went so viral
online we ended

686
00:31:21,076 --> 00:31:23,196 A:middle
up selling almost
a million dollars

687
00:31:23,336 --> 00:31:25,106 A:middle
of GoldieBlox in preorders.

688
00:31:26,006 --> 00:31:27,976 A:middle
It was overwhelming,
to say the least.

689
00:31:28,516 --> 00:31:34,986 A:middle
[ Applause ]

690
00:31:35,486 --> 00:31:37,016 A:middle
And I finally had
money in the bank.

691
00:31:37,016 --> 00:31:41,126 A:middle
I made my first hire, Lindsey,
she left her job, took the leap,

692
00:31:41,126 --> 00:31:45,306 A:middle
came onboard, and the next day
we got an email from Toys R Us,

693
00:31:46,416 --> 00:31:48,466 A:middle
which led us to our
next audacious goal:

694
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:51,236 A:middle
disrupt the pink aisle.

695
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:54,636 A:middle
So Toys R Us calls
and they said,

696
00:31:54,636 --> 00:31:55,676 A:middle
we'd like to meet with you.

697
00:31:55,926 --> 00:31:59,976 A:middle
So Lindsey and I get on a plane
and we fly to Wayne, New Jersey,

698

699
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

700
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:03,646 A:middle
and we get into the meeting

701
00:32:03,646 --> 00:32:07,246 A:middle
with these Toys R Us
executives, these men in suits.

702
00:32:07,576 --> 00:32:10,026 A:middle
And in part of the Kickstarter
video, I was skulking

703
00:32:10,026 --> 00:32:12,776 A:middle
through the pink aisle holding
up a picture of GoldieBlox next

704
00:32:12,776 --> 00:32:16,006 A:middle
to Barbie, it was
obviously like at Toys R Us.

705
00:32:16,006 --> 00:32:19,346 A:middle
And the Toys R Us guys were
like, so what's up with

706
00:32:19,756 --> 00:32:21,096 A:middle
that part in your video

707
00:32:21,256 --> 00:32:23,776 A:middle
where you're making
us look really bad?

708
00:32:24,446 --> 00:32:25,786 A:middle
I'm like, sorry.

709
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:28,946 A:middle
And it turned out that the
head construction toy buyer

710
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:32,106 A:middle
at Toys R Us had two daughters,
and he said, you know,

711
00:32:32,186 --> 00:32:33,456 A:middle
GoldieBlox is the
kind of product

712
00:32:33,456 --> 00:32:34,736 A:middle
that I want for my girls.

713
00:32:35,346 --> 00:32:38,456 A:middle
And sure enough, six months
later we're on the shelves

714
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,276 A:middle
of Toys R Us nationwide.

715
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:44,486 A:middle
I remember going in there
and looking at our products

716
00:32:44,486 --> 00:32:47,736 A:middle
on the shelf for the first
time, and I had tears in my eyes

717
00:32:47,846 --> 00:32:50,436 A:middle
because we had set this
audacious goal, yes,

718
00:32:50,566 --> 00:32:53,766 A:middle
we'll be in Toys R Us, and
never thought it would happen

719
00:32:53,766 --> 00:32:56,566 A:middle
so quickly, that all of
that hard work and passion

720
00:32:56,566 --> 00:32:59,796 A:middle
and belief could
actually happen.

721

722
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

723
00:33:00,856 --> 00:33:04,016 A:middle
But at the same time
it was pretty rough,

724
00:33:04,506 --> 00:33:08,276 A:middle
we started to get sales reports
in, and just because you're

725
00:33:08,276 --> 00:33:10,436 A:middle
in Toys R Us nationwide
doesn't mean

726
00:33:10,436 --> 00:33:13,646 A:middle
that people are necessarily
going to buy it.

727
00:33:13,816 --> 00:33:18,116 A:middle
And it wasn't looking good,
the toys weren't selling.

728
00:33:18,116 --> 00:33:20,766 A:middle
So we asked the Toys R Us
team, you know, what can we do,

729
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:22,926 A:middle
how do we get more
people to buy GoldieBlox?

730
00:33:23,466 --> 00:33:25,476 A:middle
And they said, well, most brands

731
00:33:25,476 --> 00:33:29,886 A:middle
in our store will do national
TV advertising for a minimum

732
00:33:29,886 --> 00:33:31,686 A:middle
of a $2 million buy, you know,

733
00:33:31,686 --> 00:33:33,116 A:middle
you might be able
to move the needle.

734
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:35,486 A:middle
Two million dollars?

735
00:33:36,536 --> 00:33:39,846 A:middle
That was definitely
not an option, right?

736
00:33:40,266 --> 00:33:42,716 A:middle
But we did have 5,000
Kickstarter backers

737
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:45,526 A:middle
and we had my husband, Beau,
who knew how to make a video.

738
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:49,466 A:middle
So we decided we've got to
make our own commercial.

739
00:33:49,796 --> 00:33:52,106 A:middle
And maybe we can't put it
on TV, but you know what,

740
00:33:52,106 --> 00:33:53,526 A:middle
we can put it up on YouTube.

741
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:56,636 A:middle
So we're going to disrupt
the pink aisle ourselves.

742
00:33:57,906 --> 00:34:01,536 A:middle
We reached out to all of our
Kickstarter backers and we came

743

744
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

745
00:33:57,906 --> 00:34:01,536 A:middle
We reached out to all of our
Kickstarter backers and we came

746
00:34:01,536 --> 00:34:05,806 A:middle
up with this idea, let's shoot
a video having girls rampaging

747
00:34:05,806 --> 00:34:07,516 A:middle
through the pink
aisle at Toys R Us,

748
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:12,106 A:middle
singing "We Are The Champions,"
like this is awesome.

749
00:34:12,696 --> 00:34:15,085 A:middle
So we called up our Kickstarter
backers, and we said meet us

750
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:17,636 A:middle
in the parking lot of Toys
R Us, we've got an idea.

751
00:34:18,846 --> 00:34:20,766 A:middle
So about 50 kids and
their parents showed

752
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:24,846 A:middle
up at the Toys R Us parking
lot in the blazing heat.

753
00:34:24,846 --> 00:34:28,186 A:middle
And, by the way, we didn't
exactly have permission

754
00:34:28,186 --> 00:34:32,456 A:middle
from Toys R Us to do this, so
we were just trying to lay low,

755
00:34:33,646 --> 00:34:35,936 A:middle
which definitely didn't happen

756
00:34:35,936 --> 00:34:38,436 A:middle
because within minutes the
security vehicles started

757
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:39,936 A:middle
circling us.

758
00:34:40,315 --> 00:34:42,886 A:middle
And I'm like, oh, my God, we're
totally going to get arrested,

759
00:34:42,886 --> 00:34:45,346 A:middle
we're going to get busted,
and these parents are going

760
00:34:45,346 --> 00:34:46,706 A:middle
to be like, who are you people?

761
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:50,775 A:middle
And then the manager of Toys R
Us comes out with his clipboard,

762
00:34:50,926 --> 00:34:52,496 A:middle
and now I know we're doomed.

763
00:34:52,886 --> 00:34:55,186 A:middle
And he looks at me, he's
like, who is in charge here?

764
00:34:55,306 --> 00:34:57,246 A:middle
Like, what's going on?

765
00:34:57,826 --> 00:35:00,286 A:middle
And I said, well, we're the
Ada Lovelace Girls Club,

766

767
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

768
00:34:57,826 --> 00:35:00,286 A:middle
And I said, well, we're the
Ada Lovelace Girls Club,

769
00:35:00,656 --> 00:35:02,416 A:middle
and we're on a field trip
to our favorite place

770
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:04,586 A:middle
in the world, Toys R Us.

771
00:35:04,726 --> 00:35:06,516 A:middle
Smiling. He kind of looks at me,

772
00:35:06,716 --> 00:35:09,456 A:middle
raises and eyebrow,
silence passes.

773
00:35:10,606 --> 00:35:13,356 A:middle
He says, why didn't you
tell me you were coming?

774
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:16,106 A:middle
I don't know if we
have enough gift bags.

775
00:35:16,746 --> 00:35:19,946 A:middle
Turns around, runs back into
the store, comes back out,

776
00:35:19,946 --> 00:35:23,596 A:middle
there's a guy dressed up
as Geoffrey the Giraffe.

777
00:35:23,976 --> 00:35:27,056 A:middle
We bring all the girls in, they
announce on the loudspeaker,

778
00:35:27,056 --> 00:35:29,056 A:middle
welcome, the Ada
Lovelace Girls Club!

779
00:35:29,306 --> 00:35:32,776 A:middle
And we set up our camera,
we get the girls running

780
00:35:32,776 --> 00:35:35,706 A:middle
down the aisle, we get the shot,
and then we run out of there

781
00:35:35,706 --> 00:35:36,976 A:middle
as fast as we possibly can.

782
00:35:37,516 --> 00:35:45,196 A:middle
[ Applause ]

783
00:35:45,696 --> 00:35:48,246 A:middle
We post the video on
YouTube, and it went viral.

784
00:35:48,786 --> 00:35:50,886 A:middle
Forbes picked it up
with the headline,

785
00:35:51,236 --> 00:35:55,256 A:middle
GoldieBlox Wins Toys R Us and
Quests to Redecorate Pink Aisle

786
00:35:55,256 --> 00:35:57,156 A:middle
with Engineering Kits for Girls.

787
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:01,376 A:middle
And Toys R Us, they were a
little annoyed at us at first,

788

789
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

790
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:01,376 A:middle
And Toys R Us, they were a
little annoyed at us at first,

791
00:36:01,716 --> 00:36:05,296 A:middle
but they saw what a great story
it was and they got behind it

792
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:06,986 A:middle
and they shared it
with their customers.

793
00:36:06,986 --> 00:36:10,996 A:middle
And before we knew it, finally
our toys started to sell.

794
00:36:10,996 --> 00:36:13,586 A:middle
So this little video thing
was working out for us,

795
00:36:13,816 --> 00:36:17,146 A:middle
so much so in fact that my
husband, Beau, actually left,

796
00:36:17,756 --> 00:36:20,546 A:middle
sold his video company
to come to GoldieBlox

797
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:25,196 A:middle
and take his video-making
powers and use them for good.

798
00:36:25,686 --> 00:36:28,796 A:middle
And we decided, okay, what's
our next video going to be,

799
00:36:28,796 --> 00:36:30,416 A:middle
we've got to come up
with a video that's going

800
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:32,876 A:middle
to make engineering
so cool for girls.

801
00:36:33,446 --> 00:36:38,066 A:middle
So over a lunch of margaritas
we started brainstorming,

802
00:36:38,566 --> 00:36:40,006 A:middle
and we came up with this idea.

803
00:36:40,926 --> 00:36:43,146 A:middle
So we were all big fans

804
00:36:43,146 --> 00:36:45,896 A:middle
of the OK Go Rube
Goldberg-machine music video,

805
00:36:46,156 --> 00:36:47,916 A:middle
we're like Rube Goldberg
machine,

806
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:49,746 A:middle
that makes engineering
cool, right?

807
00:36:50,346 --> 00:36:52,056 A:middle
But how will we make
it cool for girls?

808
00:36:52,056 --> 00:36:55,606 A:middle
So we came up with making
a Rube Goldberg machine

809
00:36:55,606 --> 00:36:59,646 A:middle
out of entirely stereotypical,
sexist, pink-aisle toys.

810
00:36:59,646 --> 00:37:03,866 A:middle
And then we thought,
what if we set the video

811

812
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

813
00:36:59,646 --> 00:37:03,866 A:middle
And then we thought,
what if we set the video

814
00:37:03,866 --> 00:37:05,556 A:middle
to the Beastie Boys
song "Girls,"

815
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,916 A:middle
but we flipped the lyrics,
so instead of "girls

816
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:12,086 A:middle
to do the laundry," it could be
"girls to build the spaceship"

817
00:37:12,086 --> 00:37:13,446 A:middle
or "girls to code the new app."

818
00:37:14,246 --> 00:37:17,966 A:middle
Well, we were so excited
about this idea after the end

819
00:37:18,206 --> 00:37:20,736 A:middle
of the lunch we were all high
fiving, we were like, yes,

820
00:37:21,226 --> 00:37:22,676 A:middle
this is the best idea ever.

821
00:37:23,356 --> 00:37:26,466 A:middle
And then the crazy thing
is we actually did it,

822
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:28,266 A:middle
so we created our own luck

823
00:37:28,966 --> 00:37:31,416 A:middle
and we started serial
killer-style stalking

824
00:37:31,486 --> 00:37:34,546 A:middle
to find one of the engineers
from the OK Go music video.

825
00:37:35,106 --> 00:37:36,336 A:middle
And we actually found one,

826
00:37:36,626 --> 00:37:38,506 A:middle
we told him about it,
and he was pumped.

827
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,746 A:middle
He said, yes, let's do it.

828
00:37:41,746 --> 00:37:45,436 A:middle
We rented a house, an
Airbnb in Pasadena,

829
00:37:45,606 --> 00:37:48,186 A:middle
we actually removed all of
the furniture from the house

830
00:37:48,646 --> 00:37:51,556 A:middle
so that we could build a
giant princess machine.

831
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:55,106 A:middle
Going through every room of
the house, out by the pool,

832
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,436 A:middle
in the garage, out the backdoor.

833
00:37:58,016 --> 00:38:01,326 A:middle
We got three of our original
Kickstarter girls to star

836
00:37:58,016 --> 00:38:01,326 A:middle
We got three of our original
Kickstarter girls to star

837
00:38:01,326 --> 00:38:04,686 A:middle
in the video, which started with
them watching this ultra-sappy,

838
00:38:04,686 --> 00:38:07,826 A:middle
girlie commercial on
TV, not looking amused,

839
00:38:07,896 --> 00:38:10,716 A:middle
so then they deploy the
Rube Goldberg machine.

840
00:38:10,716 --> 00:38:12,856 A:middle
And it winds its way
all through the house

841
00:38:12,856 --> 00:38:15,076 A:middle
until finally coming back
in through the living room,

842
00:38:15,276 --> 00:38:17,766 A:middle
hitting a frying pan,
going straight at the TV,

843
00:38:17,766 --> 00:38:19,706 A:middle
turning the channel
to GoldieBlox.

844
00:38:20,816 --> 00:38:24,316 A:middle
We posted the video online,
and within a week it had

845
00:38:24,316 --> 00:38:25,686 A:middle
over 12 million views.

846
00:38:25,686 --> 00:38:28,936 A:middle
It was on the Today Show,
Good Morning America,

847
00:38:29,526 --> 00:38:32,266 A:middle
Ellen is tweeting it, Chelsea
Clinton is tweeting it,

848
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:33,716 A:middle
everyone is going insane.

849
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:38,266 A:middle
It was unbelievable
until we found

850
00:38:38,266 --> 00:38:41,046 A:middle
out that the Beastie Boys were
not very amused with this video.

851
00:38:42,426 --> 00:38:46,756 A:middle
And we went from literally the
highest of highs to the lowest

852
00:38:46,756 --> 00:38:51,316 A:middle
of lows in an instant
and ended up having

853
00:38:51,316 --> 00:38:53,306 A:middle
to face a really public lawsuit.

854
00:38:54,066 --> 00:38:56,816 A:middle
We worked as hard as we could
to settle it, which we did,

855
00:38:57,506 --> 00:39:02,906 A:middle
but in that low, low time we
had to keep pushing forward.

858
00:38:57,506 --> 00:39:02,906 A:middle
but in that low, low time we
had to keep pushing forward.

859
00:39:03,256 --> 00:39:03,726 A:middle
What's next?

860
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:06,316 A:middle
How do we keep disrupting
the pink aisle,

861
00:39:06,426 --> 00:39:07,396 A:middle
staying on our mission,

862
00:39:07,396 --> 00:39:09,506 A:middle
and making engineering
cool for girls?

863
00:39:10,156 --> 00:39:12,356 A:middle
And then the opportunity
of a lifetime came.

864
00:39:13,526 --> 00:39:15,746 A:middle
We found out that Intuit
was running a program

865
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:18,286 A:middle
where one small business
could win a free Super

866
00:39:18,286 --> 00:39:19,006 A:middle
Bowl commercial.

867
00:39:20,106 --> 00:39:21,306 A:middle
And I couldn't help but think,

868
00:39:21,656 --> 00:39:24,266 A:middle
all of those old dinosaur
toy people who said

869
00:39:24,476 --> 00:39:28,386 A:middle
that GoldieBlox would never go
mainstream, this was our chance,

870
00:39:28,526 --> 00:39:30,796 A:middle
and this was our fate, right?

871
00:39:31,316 --> 00:39:32,416 A:middle
I knew we deserved to win,

872
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:35,816 A:middle
so our whole company got
onboard, all 12 of us.

873
00:39:36,096 --> 00:39:38,176 A:middle
We made it our number
one company priority,

874
00:39:38,646 --> 00:39:42,056 A:middle
and every single day we begged
our fans, we posted pictures --

875
00:39:42,056 --> 00:39:43,706 A:middle
Vote for GoldieBlox,
Vote for GoldieBlox.

876
00:39:44,396 --> 00:39:48,826 A:middle
And the amazing thing was
that when we went at it

877
00:39:49,016 --> 00:39:51,346 A:middle
and we reached out to people,
just like we had done back

878
00:39:51,346 --> 00:39:54,386 A:middle
in the days of Kickstarter,
people voted and they shared.

879
00:39:54,576 --> 00:39:56,446 A:middle
And we actually ended
up winning.

880
00:39:57,086 --> 00:40:01,116 A:middle

which is traditionally one

883
00:39:57,086 --> 00:40:01,116 A:middle
So last year in the Super Bowl,
which is traditionally one

884
00:40:01,116 --> 00:40:03,806 A:middle
of the most sexist,
male-dominated ad slots

885
00:40:03,976 --> 00:40:06,156 A:middle
in the world, we had a pack

886
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:08,886 A:middle
of girls grabbing
their pink-aisle toys,

887
00:40:09,266 --> 00:40:11,976 A:middle
racing into a park where
they built them into a rocket

888
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:14,486 A:middle
and shot them into outer space.

889
00:40:15,516 --> 00:40:22,576 A:middle
[ Applause ]

890
00:40:23,076 --> 00:40:25,156 A:middle
Well, we were on
top of the world,

891
00:40:25,686 --> 00:40:29,496 A:middle
but then my biggest
fear became a reality.

892
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:31,896 A:middle
We had a problem
with the product.

893
00:40:33,446 --> 00:40:36,346 A:middle
We were making the toys
so fast to meet the demand

894
00:40:36,346 --> 00:40:38,646 A:middle
of all the viral videos and
the Super Bowl commercial

895
00:40:39,016 --> 00:40:43,146 A:middle
that we started facing
quality issues, and the holes

896
00:40:43,146 --> 00:40:45,546 A:middle
in our blocks were a
little bit too loose,

897
00:40:46,266 --> 00:40:50,056 A:middle
like 0.0001 millimeters
too loose.

898
00:40:50,266 --> 00:40:52,466 A:middle
And even though that
sounds really small,

899
00:40:52,866 --> 00:40:55,246 A:middle
it had catastrophic results
because what happened was

900
00:40:55,246 --> 00:40:57,686 A:middle
that girls would get frustrated
and they wouldn't want to build,

901
00:40:57,716 --> 00:40:58,676 A:middle
even though they were excited.

902
00:40:58,676 --> 00:41:03,266 A:middle
And so we had to set
another audacious goal:

903

904
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

905
00:40:58,676 --> 00:41:03,266 A:middle
And so we had to set
another audacious goal:

906
00:41:03,476 --> 00:41:05,316 A:middle
replace every single block.

907
00:41:06,366 --> 00:41:08,906 A:middle
We decided we've got
to tackle this head-on.

908
00:41:08,956 --> 00:41:11,616 A:middle
It was easy to fix the blocks,
we began to do this right away,

909
00:41:11,706 --> 00:41:12,606 A:middle
that wasn't the issue.

910
00:41:12,876 --> 00:41:15,166 A:middle
It was that there were hundreds
of thousands of these blocks

911
00:41:15,696 --> 00:41:18,486 A:middle
out in the market, and how
were we going to convince girls

912
00:41:18,486 --> 00:41:19,346 A:middle
to give us a second try?

913
00:41:20,626 --> 00:41:23,046 A:middle
So we decided to reach out
to every single customer

914
00:41:23,046 --> 00:41:24,926 A:middle
that we possibly
could and tell them

915
00:41:24,926 --> 00:41:26,576 A:middle
that we would send them
new blocks for free.

916
00:41:27,206 --> 00:41:28,256 A:middle
We made a huge investment.

917
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:29,596 A:middle
We didn't have to do it.

918
00:41:29,596 --> 00:41:30,906 A:middle
It wasn't a product recall.

919
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:32,126 A:middle
But it was the right
thing to do.

920
00:41:32,126 --> 00:41:34,566 A:middle
And then we took
it a step further.

921
00:41:35,486 --> 00:41:38,486 A:middle
We got the name of every
single kid who had bought it

922
00:41:38,856 --> 00:41:40,796 A:middle
and wrote them a
personalized letter

923
00:41:40,946 --> 00:41:44,496 A:middle
from Goldie explaining
the engineering lesson

924
00:41:44,576 --> 00:41:47,176 A:middle
of how we fixed the block,
that we turned the holes

925
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:48,976 A:middle
from a circle shape
into an octogon.

[ Applause ]

927
00:41:57,726 --> 00:41:59,776 A:middle
And it worked.

929
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

930
00:42:00,136 --> 00:42:01,866 A:middle
The girls thought
Goldie was a real person,

931
00:42:01,866 --> 00:42:04,426 A:middle
and they sent us letters
back, thanking her

932
00:42:04,766 --> 00:42:06,766 A:middle
for inspiring them
to become inventors.

933
00:42:07,606 --> 00:42:11,236 A:middle
So after all this blocks
debacle we were like, gosh,

934
00:42:11,606 --> 00:42:13,896 A:middle
making hardware is really hard,

935
00:42:14,636 --> 00:42:18,716 A:middle
and maybe we could reach
more girls digitally,

936
00:42:19,086 --> 00:42:20,116 A:middle
wouldn't that be great?

937
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:23,426 A:middle
And so we came up with
a new audacious plan:

938
00:42:24,156 --> 00:42:27,276 A:middle
we're going to create
an app and we're going

939
00:42:27,276 --> 00:42:29,536 A:middle
to use our great stories
and engineering lessons

940
00:42:29,536 --> 00:42:32,456 A:middle
and scale this digitally,
reach even more girls faster.

941
00:42:33,016 --> 00:42:34,366 A:middle
And we can't just make any app,

942
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:36,636 A:middle
we've got to put an
audacious goal around it.

943
00:42:36,726 --> 00:42:39,686 A:middle
So we're going to make an app
that gets featured by Apple.

944
00:42:40,646 --> 00:42:43,526 A:middle
So we made our first hire
on the mobile space, Kyle.

[ Applause ]

946
00:42:49,236 --> 00:42:54,466 A:middle
Hi, Kyle. Making an app was
not easy, let me tell you.

947
00:42:54,696 --> 00:42:57,066 A:middle
What started as an ebook
turned into a monster.

948
00:42:57,606 --> 00:43:00,416 A:middle
We had feature creep,
is what they call it.

949

950
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

951
00:42:57,606 --> 00:43:00,416 A:middle
We had feature creep,
is what they call it.

952
00:43:00,696 --> 00:43:03,276 A:middle
But Kyle was not going to
give up, he's like we're going

953
00:43:03,276 --> 00:43:05,296 A:middle
to get this featured
by Apple, I promise,

954
00:43:05,686 --> 00:43:09,906 A:middle
and if we do I will
get a tattoo.

955
00:43:09,906 --> 00:43:14,496 A:middle
So to make a very long story
short, including a drive

956
00:43:14,496 --> 00:43:17,786 A:middle
to Cupertino, where we had to
activate wireless tethering

957
00:43:17,786 --> 00:43:20,436 A:middle
for Kyle's cell phone so that
he could download the build

958
00:43:20,436 --> 00:43:24,286 A:middle
and code it in the car,
demoing it to Apple,

959
00:43:24,286 --> 00:43:26,466 A:middle
and none of us could
believe it actually worked.

960
00:43:27,216 --> 00:43:28,346 A:middle
We launched this thing,

961
00:43:28,556 --> 00:43:31,546 A:middle
and multiple hotfixes later
we got featured by Apple

962
00:43:31,546 --> 00:43:32,776 A:middle
and Kyle got his tattoo.

963

[ Applause ]

964
00:43:39,886 --> 00:43:42,836 A:middle
And so now without further
ado, I'm going to walk you

965
00:43:42,836 --> 00:43:45,576 A:middle
through this product that
sent us to the tattoo parlor,

966
00:43:46,376 --> 00:43:49,566 A:middle
and it's our first product
so I'm really proud of --

967
00:43:49,606 --> 00:43:51,396 A:middle
it's called GoldieBlox
and the Movie Machine,

968
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:54,396 A:middle
and it blends digital
and physical and story.

969
00:43:54,836 --> 00:43:57,596 A:middle
And so as we learned
with all of our research,

970
00:43:58,236 --> 00:44:00,456 A:middle
the way to really engage
girls really starts

973
00:43:58,236 --> 00:44:00,456 A:middle
the way to really engage
girls really starts

974
00:44:00,456 --> 00:44:01,366 A:middle
with a great story.

975
00:44:02,646 --> 00:44:04,886 A:middle
So in our story we
start with Goldie.

976
00:44:05,546 --> 00:44:09,226 A:middle
She's not a princess and she's
not really a genius either,

977
00:44:09,836 --> 00:44:12,536 A:middle
but she's an inventor
who loves building even

978
00:44:12,536 --> 00:44:14,056 A:middle
if she gets it wrong
half the time.

979
00:44:15,096 --> 00:44:18,666 A:middle
So one day Goldie finds out that
the Bloxtown Film Festival is

980
00:44:18,666 --> 00:44:21,086 A:middle
cancelled because the
projector is broken.

981
00:44:21,646 --> 00:44:22,896 A:middle
So her and her friends decide,

982
00:44:23,206 --> 00:44:25,546 A:middle
we're going to save the
festival with an invention.

983
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:29,856 A:middle
After hours of brainstorming,
Goldie comes up with the idea

984
00:44:29,856 --> 00:44:32,376 A:middle
to build a zoetrope,
it's the first pre-cinema

985
00:44:32,546 --> 00:44:33,416 A:middle
animation device.

986
00:44:34,136 --> 00:44:37,146 A:middle
Using the engineering
and persistence

987
00:44:37,146 --> 00:44:38,896 A:middle
of vision science principles,

988
00:44:39,386 --> 00:44:41,316 A:middle
Goldie and her friends
build a machine

989
00:44:41,316 --> 00:44:42,896 A:middle
that creates a moving picture.

990
00:44:43,436 --> 00:44:47,446 A:middle
Once the machine actually
works, Goldie's friends kind

991
00:44:47,446 --> 00:44:49,796 A:middle
of realize, hey, there,
Goldie, there's a problem,

992
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:51,976 A:middle
this movie is only
a second long.

993
00:44:52,406 --> 00:44:56,066 A:middle
Another typical Goldie invention
flop, but Goldie sees this

994
00:44:56,066 --> 00:44:57,296 A:middle
as a golden opportunity.

995
00:44:57,836 --> 00:45:01,366 A:middle
Why don't we create the first
ever one-second Film Festival

998
00:44:57,836 --> 00:45:01,366 A:middle
Why don't we create the first
ever one-second Film Festival

00:45:04,056 --> 00:45:06,696 A:middle
And this is how we open up the
world of engineering to kids.

1001
00:45:07,266 --> 00:45:10,456 A:middle
With our construction set
kids can build a real working

1002
00:45:10,456 --> 00:45:11,886 A:middle
zoetrope with our pieces.

1003
00:45:12,506 --> 00:45:15,186 A:middle
The pieces are inspired by
common household objects,

1004
00:45:15,886 --> 00:45:19,686 A:middle
stuff from the hardware store,
the arts and crafts section.

1005
00:45:19,916 --> 00:45:21,886 A:middle
What helps with making
these pieces feel

1006
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:24,086 A:middle
like common household
objects is it makes kids start

1007
00:45:24,086 --> 00:45:25,756 A:middle
to see the world
as their toolbox,

1008
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:27,586 A:middle
that they can really
invent anything.

1009
00:45:27,586 --> 00:45:30,476 A:middle
But then what really
brings the experience

1010
00:45:30,546 --> 00:45:34,706 A:middle
to life is our mobile app,
with drawing tools, stamps,

1011
00:45:35,186 --> 00:45:37,396 A:middle
stop motion photography
and backgrounds,

1012
00:45:37,796 --> 00:45:40,096 A:middle
kids can make their
own movies digitally,

1013
00:45:40,466 --> 00:45:43,476 A:middle
and then they can air print
them if they want to play

1014
00:45:43,586 --> 00:45:46,246 A:middle
in their actual zoetrope
movie machine device,

1015
00:45:46,756 --> 00:45:48,646 A:middle
they can email them,
they can text them,

1016
00:45:49,176 --> 00:45:51,716 A:middle
or they can even send
it to the Apple Watch.

them a star for a job well done.

00:46:03,926 --> 00:46:06,536 A:middle
What's so cool is to see
what this app has inspired,

1022
00:46:07,006 --> 00:46:10,486 A:middle
you never can guess what
kids are going to make,

1023
00:46:10,786 --> 00:46:12,796 A:middle
and it's pretty extraordinary.

1024
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:16,696 A:middle
Actually, kids have made
over a million movies

1025
00:46:17,106 --> 00:46:18,416 A:middle
in this app that we launched.

1026
00:46:18,576 --> 00:46:22,896 A:middle
And it's so rewarding to see
how girls can get excited

1027
00:46:22,986 --> 00:46:25,966 A:middle
to invent things and build
cool stuff, and it's awesome

1028
00:46:25,966 --> 00:46:27,636 A:middle
to be a part of that
and give them the tools

1029
00:46:27,636 --> 00:46:30,686 A:middle
and encouragement to do that.

1030
00:46:31,226 --> 00:46:32,716 A:middle
So where do we go next?

1031
00:46:33,716 --> 00:46:35,686 A:middle
How do you go from here?

1032
00:46:36,176 --> 00:46:38,046 A:middle
We've hit a lot of
audacious goals, right?

1033
00:46:38,706 --> 00:46:41,406 A:middle
Well, the thing about having
audacious goals is once you hit

1034
00:46:41,406 --> 00:46:45,016 A:middle
one and you know it's possible,
you set out a bigger one

1035
00:46:45,016 --> 00:46:46,256 A:middle
and an even bigger one.

1036
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:48,696 A:middle
And that's certainly
what my team is doing.

1037
00:46:49,296 --> 00:46:52,066 A:middle
We've got a ton of audacious
goals that we want to hit next.

1038
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:56,556 A:middle
Now we probably won't hit all
of these, but we're never going

1039
00:46:56,556 --> 00:46:59,066 A:middle
to stop shooting for the
moon, like, literally,

1040
00:46:59,176 --> 00:47:01,116 A:middle
first doll on the moon is
actually one of our goals.

first doll on the moon is

1044
00:47:01,956 --> 00:47:04,906 A:middle
And how can we be so audacious?

1045
00:47:04,906 --> 00:47:08,526 A:middle
Well, it's because at the end of
the day, the mission is greater

1046
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:11,026 A:middle
than our company, and I
never feel embarrassed going

1047
00:47:11,066 --> 00:47:13,966 A:middle
and asking somebody for help
or asking somebody to be a part

1048
00:47:13,966 --> 00:47:15,796 A:middle
of it because it's
bigger than all of us.

1049
00:47:16,336 --> 00:47:20,066 A:middle
We really believe in it,
and I'm reminded every day

1050
00:47:20,066 --> 00:47:24,456 A:middle
that it's working because
every day we see evidence

1051
00:47:24,856 --> 00:47:26,716 A:middle
of girls getting
inspired by GoldieBlox.

1052
00:47:27,566 --> 00:47:31,296 A:middle
Recently I got a letter from
a mom, she was telling me

1053
00:47:31,296 --> 00:47:35,066 A:middle
that her daughter was not
excited to go to science camp,

1054
00:47:35,676 --> 00:47:37,926 A:middle
that every morning her
daughter would whine and whine

1055
00:47:37,926 --> 00:47:39,636 A:middle
and she'd have to
drag her to camp.

1056
00:47:39,636 --> 00:47:40,746 A:middle
Her daughter didn't want to go

1057
00:47:40,746 --> 00:47:42,656 A:middle
because the camp
was almost all boys.

1058
00:47:43,746 --> 00:47:46,816 A:middle
And then her mom bought her
GoldieBlox and they played it

1059
00:47:46,816 --> 00:47:48,566 A:middle
over the weekend
together, they had a blast.

1060
00:47:49,436 --> 00:47:51,626 A:middle
On Monday they were
getting ready to go to camp,

1061
00:47:51,626 --> 00:47:54,896 A:middle
and her daughter wasn't
having her usual crying fit.

1062
00:47:55,946 --> 00:47:59,226 A:middle
And her Mom asked her what's
going on with you, you know,

1063
00:47:59,976 --> 00:48:03,066 A:middle
what's going on, and why aren't
you nervous about camp anymore?

1066
00:47:59,976 --> 00:48:03,066 A:middle
what's going on, and why aren't
you nervous about camp anymore?

1067
00:48:03,446 --> 00:48:06,406 A:middle
And her daughter said, oh, Mom,
I'm not nervous about camp,

1068
00:48:06,406 --> 00:48:09,486 A:middle
I've got GoldieBlox,
I'm all set.

1069
00:48:09,816 --> 00:48:12,346 A:middle
And I know it sounds like
I'm making this story up,

1070
00:48:12,346 --> 00:48:14,656 A:middle
but I'm actually not,
like, this really happened.

1071
00:48:15,056 --> 00:48:19,516 A:middle
And it's amazing because with
GoldieBlox we're starting

1072
00:48:19,516 --> 00:48:21,486 A:middle
to give these girls
a role model,

1073
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:25,106 A:middle
somebody who they can
see themselves being.

1074
00:48:25,426 --> 00:48:27,956 A:middle
And we're not just teaching
them some engineering lessons,

1075
00:48:28,016 --> 00:48:30,156 A:middle
but we're actually
giving them confidence.

1076
00:48:30,156 --> 00:48:32,846 A:middle
And that's what we,
all of us here,

1077
00:48:32,846 --> 00:48:35,196 A:middle
have the opportunity to do.

1078
00:48:35,706 --> 00:48:39,166 A:middle
We can help kids shape the
way that they see the world,

1079
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:41,726 A:middle
whether it's the
products that we build

1080
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:44,236 A:middle
or just the things
that we say to kids.

1081
00:48:44,236 --> 00:48:47,926 A:middle
I mean think about it, every
time you see a little girl

1082
00:48:47,926 --> 00:48:49,606 A:middle
and you tell her that
she looks beautiful,

1083
00:48:50,146 --> 00:48:51,596 A:middle
imagine what a difference
it would make

1084
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:54,886 A:middle
if you said she looks capable?

1087
00:49:02,056 --> 00:49:05,136 A:middle
Or every time you're
making a game or a movie

1088
00:49:05,136 --> 00:49:09,646 A:middle
and you're choosing a hero and
you automatically make it a boy,

1089
00:49:10,736 --> 00:49:12,836 A:middle
what if you made it
a girl, you know?

1090
00:49:13,656 --> 00:49:15,656 A:middle
Sometimes we propagate
gender stereotypes

1091
00:49:15,656 --> 00:49:18,756 A:middle
and we don't even realize
it, but the cool thing is

1092
00:49:19,216 --> 00:49:20,846 A:middle
that we have the
opportunity to change that.

1093
00:49:21,676 --> 00:49:24,226 A:middle
There's no pink or blue
aisle in the App Store,

1094
00:49:24,396 --> 00:49:28,086 A:middle
and we get to put stuff
out there that, you know,

1095
00:49:28,086 --> 00:49:30,746 A:middle
kids are so impressionable,
we can put stuff

1096
00:49:30,746 --> 00:49:32,576 A:middle
out there that's going to
make them see the world

1097
00:49:32,576 --> 00:49:33,276 A:middle
in a whole new way.

1098
00:49:33,446 --> 00:49:36,946 A:middle
And if we do that, and if you
all join me on this mission,

1099
00:49:37,916 --> 00:49:40,676 A:middle
we can achieve my last and
final audacious goal --

1100
00:49:41,536 --> 00:49:44,596 A:middle
that sometime in our
own lifetime 50 percent

1101
00:49:44,806 --> 00:49:46,586 A:middle
of WWDC is women.
