[ Applause ]

2
00:00:29,116 --> 00:00:32,406 A:middle
>> SAL SOGHOIAN: Whoa, thank
you and welcome to Session 306,

3
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:36,016 A:middle
Supporting the Enterprise
with OS X Automation.

4
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:38,436 A:middle
I am Sal Soghoian.

5
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:41,296 A:middle
I am the Product Manager
for Automation Technologies

6
00:00:41,296 --> 00:00:45,506 A:middle
at Apple, and I'm
excited to be here today.

7
00:00:46,056 --> 00:00:49,556 A:middle
Some days I feel like I'm a
dinosaur looking for a tar pit,

8
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:52,736 A:middle
but today is not
one of those days.

9
00:00:53,026 --> 00:00:56,056 A:middle
We're here to talk
about automation

10
00:00:56,626 --> 00:01:00,636 A:middle
and how it can be used
in production situations,

11

12
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

13
00:00:56,626 --> 00:01:00,636 A:middle
and how it can be used
in production situations,

14
00:01:00,636 --> 00:01:05,385 A:middle
how it can be used within your
organization to address some

15
00:01:05,385 --> 00:01:08,206 A:middle
of the tasks and challenges
that often come up.

16
00:01:09,406 --> 00:01:15,626 A:middle
And before we begin, I just want
to make it clear in our minds

17
00:01:15,626 --> 00:01:21,756 A:middle
that when you talk about an
enterprise you're actually

18
00:01:21,756 --> 00:01:23,586 A:middle
talking about people.

19
00:01:24,726 --> 00:01:27,586 A:middle
People are what comprise
an enterprise

20
00:01:27,586 --> 00:01:30,626 A:middle
and make it successful, they
are the people that come

21
00:01:30,626 --> 00:01:32,856 A:middle
up with the creativity,
they are the ones

22
00:01:32,946 --> 00:01:35,166 A:middle
that implement solutions,
they are the ones

23
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,536 A:middle
that create solutions.

24
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:38,426 A:middle
You are those kind of people.

25
00:01:39,226 --> 00:01:42,186 A:middle
You look for a problem, and
you look for ways to solve it.

26
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:46,836 A:middle
So throughout this talk today,
I'm always going to look

27
00:01:46,836 --> 00:01:51,596 A:middle
at things from a people
perspective, so let's keep

28
00:01:51,596 --> 00:01:55,706 A:middle
that in mind as we look at
the enterprise and automation.

29
00:01:56,686 --> 00:02:00,086 A:middle
And specifically when
you're creating a solution,

30

31
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

32
00:01:56,686 --> 00:02:00,086 A:middle
And specifically when
you're creating a solution,

33
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:03,226 A:middle
or I call them a workflow,
there's some strategies

34
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:05,186 A:middle
that could be useful to follow

35
00:02:05,446 --> 00:02:07,286 A:middle
when you're designing
a solution.

36
00:02:07,776 --> 00:02:11,886 A:middle
And the first is use
a variety of tools.

37
00:02:13,006 --> 00:02:15,636 A:middle
It's interesting that
you have to mention this,

38
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:19,526 A:middle
but people often get locked
into a one-tool concept.

39
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:24,946 A:middle
Don't solve everything with
a hammer because then all

40
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:27,146 A:middle
of the problems appear
to be nails.

41
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:30,076 A:middle
Use the right tool for the job,

42
00:02:30,796 --> 00:02:33,296 A:middle
don't try to drive a
nail with a wrench.

43
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:38,786 A:middle
You know, use the right tool
that gives you the ability

44
00:02:38,786 --> 00:02:40,996 A:middle
to accomplish what you
need to accomplish.

45
00:02:41,546 --> 00:02:48,736 A:middle
And, as well, make
your workflows modular

46
00:02:49,196 --> 00:02:52,036 A:middle
so that you can take the
individual components

47
00:02:52,036 --> 00:02:56,966 A:middle
of a workflow and adjust them or
connect them in different ways

48
00:02:56,966 --> 00:02:59,476 A:middle
or use them in other
solutions as well.

49

50
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

51
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:04,266 A:middle
So by keeping your workflow as
a modular design it's easier

52
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:06,756 A:middle
to find the points where
there are problems,

53
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:12,096 A:middle
and problems always appear when
you're trying to use a workflow

54
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:14,006 A:middle
in an enterprise solution.

55
00:03:14,936 --> 00:03:18,016 A:middle
Look for the places that
are the bottlenecks,

56
00:03:18,016 --> 00:03:20,286 A:middle
and they usually occur
around complexity

57
00:03:20,286 --> 00:03:25,346 A:middle
or a heavy repetition, and you
want to identify those places

58
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:28,636 A:middle
and address them so that
your workflows run smooth.

59
00:03:29,646 --> 00:03:32,796 A:middle
And that's because
in the end all

60
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:36,166 A:middle
of our workflows
are run by people.

61
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:41,666 A:middle
And if your solution is
really complex and intricate,

62
00:03:42,196 --> 00:03:45,256 A:middle
people aren't going to use it
or they won't like using it.

63
00:03:45,716 --> 00:03:50,566 A:middle
But if your workflow is designed
logically so that it flows

64
00:03:50,806 --> 00:03:53,446 A:middle
and it's understandable,
then people are going

65
00:03:53,446 --> 00:03:56,066 A:middle
to love using it and
they'll use it all the time.

66
00:03:57,376 --> 00:04:00,186 A:middle
So those are the basic workflow
strategies that we're going

67

68
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

69
00:03:57,376 --> 00:04:00,186 A:middle
So those are the basic workflow
strategies that we're going

70
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:03,186 A:middle
to look at as I review
some examples

71
00:04:03,466 --> 00:04:05,836 A:middle
of how you can use
automation in the enterprise,

72
00:04:06,136 --> 00:04:09,546 A:middle
but there's one more concept I'd
like you to pay attention to,

73
00:04:10,136 --> 00:04:12,966 A:middle
and it is to pursue inclusion.

74
00:04:14,106 --> 00:04:18,416 A:middle
Now what I mean by that
is this: that the success

75
00:04:18,555 --> 00:04:25,046 A:middle
of an organization depends upon
the strategy of and, not or.

76
00:04:25,846 --> 00:04:30,936 A:middle
Many times people get locked
into the idea that's often used

77
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:34,856 A:middle
for hardware that one piece of
hardware has to go away in order

78
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:38,516 A:middle
for another piece of hardware to
take its place, and many times

79
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:42,806 A:middle
that is true, but when it
comes to providing solutions,

80
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:45,796 A:middle
inclusion is really important.

81
00:04:45,946 --> 00:04:48,996 A:middle
You want to use all of the
tools that are available to you,

82
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:52,586 A:middle
and we have two platforms
at Apple

83
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:56,986 A:middle
that really personify
this power.

84
00:04:57,556 --> 00:05:03,586 A:middle
And they are OS X and iOS, and
they work really well together,

85

86
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

87
00:04:57,556 --> 00:05:03,586 A:middle
And they are OS X and iOS, and
they work really well together,

88
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:07,676 A:middle
and it is through them working
together that you get success

89
00:05:07,676 --> 00:05:09,126 A:middle
for your organization.

90
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:13,616 A:middle
When it comes to
being a good partner,

91
00:05:14,236 --> 00:05:17,746 A:middle
OS X is an incredible
operating system.

92
00:05:17,866 --> 00:05:22,436 A:middle
It is mature, it has a depth of
frameworks that is unrivaled,

93
00:05:22,816 --> 00:05:25,426 A:middle
it has support for all
the different connective

94
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:28,486 A:middle
technologies that you
want to use in-house

95
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,086 A:middle
in your organization
to communicate

96
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:33,086 A:middle
and share data back and forth.

97
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:38,936 A:middle
And when it comes to
automation, OS X is unrivaled.

98
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,566 A:middle
We have AppleScript, the
English-like language

99
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:45,676 A:middle
that you can use to control the
computer and the applications

100
00:05:45,676 --> 00:05:49,306 A:middle
that run on it, and we've
extended AppleScript

101
00:05:49,586 --> 00:05:53,256 A:middle
with AppleScript/Objective-C,
that gives it a window

102
00:05:53,526 --> 00:05:57,106 A:middle
into the Cocoa framework so
that you can directly talk

103
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:01,516 A:middle
to Cocoa classes and call Cocoa
methods from within AppleScript,

104

105
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

106
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:01,516 A:middle
to Cocoa classes and call Cocoa
methods from within AppleScript,

107
00:06:01,976 --> 00:06:04,136 A:middle
so that any of the
Cocoa frameworks

108
00:06:04,136 --> 00:06:06,726 A:middle
that provide the power
for the OS and all

109
00:06:06,726 --> 00:06:09,746 A:middle
of its apps are available
to your script as well.

110
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:16,206 A:middle
And last OS, we introduced
JavaScript for Automation

111
00:06:17,036 --> 00:06:20,206 A:middle
so that if you like working with
the JavaScript language or you

112
00:06:20,206 --> 00:06:24,536 A:middle
like a more tight construct,
JavaScript for Automation --

113
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:28,676 A:middle
or JXA as we call it -- provides
you all of the abilities

114
00:06:28,676 --> 00:06:31,366 A:middle
to control applications
as similar

115
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:35,006 A:middle
to the way AppleScript does and
it also provides you the window

116
00:06:35,006 --> 00:06:37,066 A:middle
into the Cocoa frameworks,
as well.

117
00:06:37,586 --> 00:06:41,516 A:middle
So if you like using JavaScript,
you can still accomplish all

118
00:06:41,516 --> 00:06:44,106 A:middle
of the kind of automations
you want to do using

119
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:45,766 A:middle
that as your native language.

120
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:50,166 A:middle
And another tool that we
have is Otto the Automator.

121
00:06:50,926 --> 00:06:57,026 A:middle
Automator is a visual tool for
building automation recipes,

122
00:06:57,806 --> 00:06:59,496 A:middle
through a drag-and-drop process

123
00:06:59,496 --> 00:07:02,246 A:middle
where you take the individual
steps that are required

124

125
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

126
00:06:59,496 --> 00:07:02,246 A:middle
where you take the individual
steps that are required

127
00:07:02,246 --> 00:07:05,596 A:middle
to accomplish something and
you drag them into a file

128
00:07:05,596 --> 00:07:07,256 A:middle
and save them as a workflow.

129
00:07:07,556 --> 00:07:11,316 A:middle
It's incredibly powerful,
it works with any language

130
00:07:11,316 --> 00:07:13,896 A:middle
or ability that's part
of the operating system,

131
00:07:14,056 --> 00:07:17,016 A:middle
and it handles data translation
for you automatically.

132
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,336 A:middle
We're going to see
this quite a bit today

133
00:07:19,336 --> 00:07:21,046 A:middle
as we go over some examples.

134
00:07:21,626 --> 00:07:25,436 A:middle
And, finally, because
of its heritage

135
00:07:25,436 --> 00:07:30,946 A:middle
and its power OS X has all of
the UNIX toolset we've come

136
00:07:30,946 --> 00:07:34,446 A:middle
to rely upon, including all of
the different shelves and some

137
00:07:34,446 --> 00:07:38,026 A:middle
of your favorite languages, like
Pearl, Ruby, and Python as well.

138
00:07:38,476 --> 00:07:41,266 A:middle
So combined, it's a
holistic approach.

139
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,406 A:middle
This is a very powerful set

140
00:07:43,406 --> 00:07:47,046 A:middle
of automation tools
for you to rely upon.

141
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:53,446 A:middle
And today we're going to see
how automation can give you the

142
00:07:53,446 --> 00:07:56,796 A:middle
speed, the accuracy,
the consistent output,

143
00:07:57,306 --> 00:07:59,426 A:middle
and the scalability
that you need

144
00:07:59,426 --> 00:08:01,486 A:middle
when you're dealing
with solutions.

145

146
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

147
00:07:59,426 --> 00:08:01,486 A:middle
when you're dealing
with solutions.

148
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:05,496 A:middle
So let's take a look at
three example scenarios.

149
00:08:05,496 --> 00:08:06,966 A:middle
I'm going to keep them simple

150
00:08:07,206 --> 00:08:10,906 A:middle
so that we can examine the
principle behind them rather

151
00:08:10,906 --> 00:08:12,746 A:middle
than get lost in any complexity.

152
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:14,746 A:middle
See, I'm being people-oriented
here.

153
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:17,026 A:middle
The first scenario
we're going to look

154
00:08:17,026 --> 00:08:21,906 A:middle
at is how you can create a
workgroup image repository,

155
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,296 A:middle
and by that I mean we can
have a central computer

156
00:08:25,686 --> 00:08:30,536 A:middle
that is accessible by 40 or 50
people in a local network area

157
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:35,525 A:middle
by both computers and
wireless devices as well,

158
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:39,936 A:middle
and how we can use automation
and the technologies of OS X

159
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,405 A:middle
to make that possible.

160
00:08:42,326 --> 00:08:45,976 A:middle
The second scenario we're
going to look at a basic thing

161
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:49,266 A:middle
that faces everyone who
works in an organization,

162
00:08:49,586 --> 00:08:52,186 A:middle
and that's creating
documents on time.

163
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:55,636 A:middle
You know, everybody has
challenges of gathering data,

164
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:59,186 A:middle
and putting it together, and
formatting it, and presenting it

165
00:08:59,186 --> 00:09:02,146 A:middle
in interesting ways,
and so we can look

166

167
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

168
00:08:59,186 --> 00:09:02,146 A:middle
in interesting ways,
and so we can look

169
00:09:02,146 --> 00:09:04,666 A:middle
at how automation can
be used to solve some

170
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,186 A:middle
of those issues as well.

171
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:08,386 A:middle
And, finally, we're
going to look

172
00:09:08,386 --> 00:09:10,886 A:middle
at a third example that's new,

173
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:17,926 A:middle
where you can use the automation
technologies in OS X to set up

174
00:09:18,246 --> 00:09:21,386 A:middle
and manage iOS devices
automatically.

175
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,586 A:middle
So this is going to be an
interesting category for us

176
00:09:24,586 --> 00:09:26,006 A:middle
because it's a new one as well.

177
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:30,156 A:middle
So let's begin with a workgroup
image repository scenario.

178
00:09:30,346 --> 00:09:33,516 A:middle
Now remember I'm talking
about setting up a computer

179
00:09:33,516 --> 00:09:35,906 A:middle
that is an image
repository, and we're going

180
00:09:35,906 --> 00:09:40,556 A:middle
to be specifically using
the new photos architecture

181
00:09:40,556 --> 00:09:43,736 A:middle
and frameworks and application
that are part of OS X.

182
00:09:43,846 --> 00:09:46,426 A:middle
And we're going to set
it up on a computer,

183
00:09:46,496 --> 00:09:50,356 A:middle
and this computer is going
to exist in an environment

184
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:55,096 A:middle
where you have other
laptops and desktop computers

185
00:09:55,646 --> 00:09:57,446 A:middle
that might be running Mac OS X

186
00:09:57,446 --> 00:10:01,276 A:middle
or it could even be running
Windows, as well as being

187

188
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

189
00:09:57,446 --> 00:10:01,276 A:middle
or it could even be running
Windows, as well as being

190
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:03,646 A:middle
in an environment that
has mobile devices,

191
00:10:03,846 --> 00:10:06,676 A:middle
whether it's the new MacBook
that we just introduced

192
00:10:07,036 --> 00:10:10,726 A:middle
or it's our great iOS devices,
like iPads and iPhones.

193
00:10:11,386 --> 00:10:16,096 A:middle
And to accomplish this workgroup
concept, we're going to rely

194
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:18,966 A:middle
on three OS X technologies.

195
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:21,096 A:middle
The first we're going
to use is File Sharing.

196
00:10:22,026 --> 00:10:26,736 A:middle
Now File Sharing is part of
OS X basic core structure,

197
00:10:26,856 --> 00:10:29,946 A:middle
and it allows you to
set up share points

198
00:10:30,306 --> 00:10:34,046 A:middle
so that other computers
can easily transfer files

199
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:35,476 A:middle
over to your computer.

200
00:10:35,876 --> 00:10:39,046 A:middle
It's been around forever,
it's based on SMB and AFP,

201
00:10:39,046 --> 00:10:43,156 A:middle
it's very reliable, it's
an established technology.

202
00:10:43,806 --> 00:10:47,866 A:middle
The second technology we're
going to look at is AirDrop,

203
00:10:49,046 --> 00:10:52,216 A:middle
and AirDrop is a
newer technology

204
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:54,356 A:middle
that combines Bluetooth
with Wi-Fi

205
00:10:54,706 --> 00:10:58,996 A:middle
so that mobile devices
can easily recognize

206
00:10:58,996 --> 00:11:01,916 A:middle
and transfer files
to a computer.

207

208
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

209
00:10:58,996 --> 00:11:01,916 A:middle
and transfer files
to a computer.

210
00:11:02,546 --> 00:11:05,106 A:middle
And we're going to use
both of those technologies

211
00:11:05,446 --> 00:11:09,256 A:middle
when we address this task.

212
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:12,846 A:middle
Now you'll notice that in
this connective scenario

213
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:15,616 A:middle
that we have here, where
we have the computers

214
00:11:15,616 --> 00:11:20,526 A:middle
and the iOS devices, there's one
area that still needs some work

215
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:22,936 A:middle
in order for all of this
to become automated.

216
00:11:23,276 --> 00:11:28,896 A:middle
And it is the transferal of the
copied documents or the images

217
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,726 A:middle
that have been provided
from other sources

218
00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:34,586 A:middle
into the actual media
library itself.

219
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:37,036 A:middle
And to solve that
problem we're going

220
00:11:37,036 --> 00:11:41,286 A:middle
to use a technology
called Folder Actions

221
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,566 A:middle
through Automator.

222
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,056 A:middle
Now many of you might not
know about Folder Actions,

223
00:11:46,096 --> 00:11:50,366 A:middle
but a Folder Action is a
system service that allows you

224
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:55,696 A:middle
to assign a workflow to a folder
so that when items are placed

225
00:11:55,696 --> 00:11:59,846 A:middle
into that folder, the system
automatically provides them

226
00:11:59,846 --> 00:12:04,176 A:middle
as input to a workflow that it
executes for you automatically.

227

228
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

229
00:11:59,846 --> 00:12:04,176 A:middle
as input to a workflow that it
executes for you automatically.

230
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:07,906 A:middle
And Folder Actions
have been part of OS X

231
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:12,376 A:middle
since before it was OS X,
we've had them since System 8.5

232
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:15,816 A:middle
and they're very powerful, and
we've done a lot of work on it

233
00:12:15,976 --> 00:12:17,936 A:middle
with the new release
and I think you're going

234
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:19,436 A:middle
to really enjoy using them.

235
00:12:19,686 --> 00:12:24,466 A:middle
So let me show you how easy it
is to create a Folder Action.

236
00:12:25,456 --> 00:12:28,836 A:middle
For this we're going to need,
for our scenario we're going

237
00:12:28,836 --> 00:12:30,406 A:middle
to need two different
Folder Actions,

238
00:12:30,536 --> 00:12:35,466 A:middle
one for the Dropbox folder
for the file sharing and one

239
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:38,786 A:middle
for the Downloads folder
that is the recipient

240
00:12:38,786 --> 00:12:40,616 A:middle
of the AirDrop files.

241
00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:43,646 A:middle
And to do that I'm going
to open up Automator,

242
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,576 A:middle
I'm going to create
a new document,

243
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:48,616 A:middle
and from the template I'm
going to choose Folder Action

244
00:12:48,616 --> 00:12:51,146 A:middle
as the type of Automator file.

245
00:12:53,276 --> 00:12:56,786 A:middle
And at the top we're
going to select a folder

246
00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:59,846 A:middle
that is the source
folder for the workflow.

247

248
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

249
00:13:01,116 --> 00:13:06,226 A:middle
So we'll select that,
and I'll navigate

250
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:10,816 A:middle
over to the Public
folder and then

251
00:13:10,816 --> 00:13:12,136 A:middle
within the Public
folder we're going

252
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:16,196 A:middle
to select the Dropbox
folder as the source folder.

253
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:19,706 A:middle
So any items placed into
the Dropbox are going

254
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:21,666 A:middle
to become the input
for this workflow.

255
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:24,816 A:middle
Now we need to perform
some series of actions

256
00:13:24,896 --> 00:13:28,576 A:middle
on those added files,
and to do that I'm going

257
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:33,726 A:middle
to select the Photos category
over here and I'm going to drag

258
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:38,436 A:middle
in the Automator action for
importing items into Photos.

259
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:42,166 A:middle
And I'm running a little
bit of a lag -- there we go.

260
00:13:42,946 --> 00:13:44,916 A:middle
And so once you've
added an action

261
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,726 A:middle
to the workflow you
see its action view.

262
00:13:48,006 --> 00:13:50,486 A:middle
The action view contains
all of the controls

263
00:13:50,486 --> 00:13:52,876 A:middle
for the various parameters
for that action.

264
00:13:53,046 --> 00:13:56,286 A:middle
So we're going to set some basic
parameters for that action,

265
00:13:57,216 --> 00:13:59,856 A:middle
and then it's just a matter
of saving the workflow

266
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:07,346 A:middle
and giving it a name, like
Import from Dropbox, very good.

267

268
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

269
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:07,346 A:middle
and giving it a name, like
Import from Dropbox, very good.

270
00:14:08,226 --> 00:14:11,776 A:middle
And once it's been saved
it's automatically installed

271
00:14:11,776 --> 00:14:14,246 A:middle
into the operating
system and active.

272
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,876 A:middle
We'll create a second workflow
just like the first one,

273
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,886 A:middle
the only difference is its
source folder will be the

274
00:14:20,886 --> 00:14:21,856 A:middle
Downloads folder.

275
00:14:22,306 --> 00:14:26,166 A:middle
So that's how easy it is
to create a Folder Action

276
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,696 A:middle
that can receive files
from network devices.

277
00:14:30,156 --> 00:14:33,956 A:middle
Once that's been done, then
any files that are placed

278
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,666 A:middle
into these connected
folders will get transferred

279
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,236 A:middle
automatically into
our image repository.

280
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,976 A:middle
So let's take a people
perspective

281
00:14:41,976 --> 00:14:43,696 A:middle
and see how this looks

282
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:47,066 A:middle
to a person using this
from, like, the Mac side.

283
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:50,906 A:middle
So if you're running
this from the Mac side,

284
00:14:51,506 --> 00:14:53,886 A:middle
you have a Finder
window and to connect

285
00:14:53,886 --> 00:14:58,146 A:middle
to the repository shared folder
is just a matter of going

286
00:14:58,146 --> 00:15:01,466 A:middle
to the Finder sidebar
and connecting that,

287

288
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

289
00:14:58,146 --> 00:15:01,466 A:middle
to the Finder sidebar
and connecting that,

290
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:06,596 A:middle
selecting the Public folder
there, and then dragging

291
00:15:06,596 --> 00:15:11,926 A:middle
in whatever images you have
onto the Dropbox itself.

292
00:15:14,676 --> 00:15:18,976 A:middle
The computer is running a
little slow today, there we go,

293
00:15:19,556 --> 00:15:20,566 A:middle
you can see all the builds.

294
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:23,976 A:middle
And once you do that you'll
get a notification dialogue

295
00:15:23,976 --> 00:15:27,186 A:middle
that tells you you're
about to copy some files

296
00:15:27,186 --> 00:15:29,236 A:middle
and you won't be able to
see them -- is that okay?

297
00:15:29,236 --> 00:15:31,146 A:middle
You approve that
and the files --

298
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:34,296 A:middle
the two computers are
automatically connected,

299
00:15:34,646 --> 00:15:37,596 A:middle
and the file gets transferred
over into the other folder.

300
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:41,476 A:middle
The Automator workflow
gets executed,

301
00:15:41,476 --> 00:15:45,246 A:middle
and the copied image gets
added to our image repository.

302
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:48,126 A:middle
So this is how it looks
when you're running this

303
00:15:48,126 --> 00:15:50,806 A:middle
from the OS X side of
things through file sharing.

304
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:54,206 A:middle
Now let's examine the same
process, but this time

305
00:15:54,206 --> 00:15:57,046 A:middle
from the viewpoint of
using a mobile device.

306
00:15:58,556 --> 00:16:02,856 A:middle
So with your mobile device you
connect it, you turn it on,

307

308
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

309
00:15:58,556 --> 00:16:02,856 A:middle
So with your mobile device you
connect it, you turn it on,

310
00:16:02,856 --> 00:16:05,426 A:middle
you find the image that you
want from your mobile device,

311
00:16:05,426 --> 00:16:08,636 A:middle
you click, you tap
the Share button.

312
00:16:09,086 --> 00:16:17,456 A:middle
You wait for the destination
to become visible as a network,

313
00:16:18,296 --> 00:16:21,356 A:middle
as an AirDrop target,
you select the AirDrop

314
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:24,636 A:middle
and then the connection is made
and the image is transferred

315
00:16:24,636 --> 00:16:28,406 A:middle
over to the computer, and then
the Folder Action is triggered

316
00:16:28,676 --> 00:16:30,356 A:middle
and the image is copied into it.

317
00:16:31,016 --> 00:16:34,386 A:middle
So from a person's
perspective you can see

318
00:16:34,546 --> 00:16:38,116 A:middle
that this becomes a very
easy-to-use operation.

319
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:43,356 A:middle
This strategy incorporates
basic technologies that are part

320
00:16:43,356 --> 00:16:46,886 A:middle
of OS X and File Sharing
and AirDrop as well

321
00:16:46,886 --> 00:16:50,646 A:middle
as Folder Actions, and it works
with a variety of devices,

322
00:16:50,806 --> 00:16:55,386 A:middle
including computers, Mac
computers, Windows computers,

323
00:16:55,486 --> 00:16:57,146 A:middle
and mobile devices as well.

324
00:16:57,706 --> 00:17:00,436 A:middle
Now I know you're asking,
well, okay, Sal, wait a second,

325

326
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

327
00:16:57,706 --> 00:17:00,436 A:middle
Now I know you're asking,
well, okay, Sal, wait a second,

328
00:17:00,846 --> 00:17:04,915 A:middle
so when I send an AirDrop
over, there's a notification

329
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:07,846 A:middle
that happens, what
happens if there's nobody

330
00:17:07,846 --> 00:17:10,256 A:middle
at the computer,
what do you do then?

331
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:11,896 A:middle
Well, here's another case

332
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:14,636 A:middle
where automation can
solve a problem for you.

333
00:17:14,996 --> 00:17:19,306 A:middle
You can use the Auto
Accept AppleScript droplet

334
00:17:19,546 --> 00:17:22,786 A:middle
that whenever a notification
is set,

335
00:17:22,786 --> 00:17:25,636 A:middle
it will automatically accept
it and continue the process

336
00:17:25,636 --> 00:17:27,586 A:middle
of allowing the image
to be transferred

337
00:17:27,586 --> 00:17:29,986 A:middle
over to the media library.

338
00:17:31,396 --> 00:17:34,916 A:middle
All of this is available, you
can download the beta version

339
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,936 A:middle
of the photos actions
that you saw here

340
00:17:38,326 --> 00:17:40,416 A:middle
and you can follow the
instructions on this

341
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,536 A:middle
and as well get the
Auto Accept droplet

342
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:46,466 A:middle
from this location,
photosautomation.com.

343
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:50,226 A:middle
Okay, so that's our
first scenario

344
00:17:50,226 --> 00:17:55,456 A:middle
of using automation technologies
in a mixed-use environment

345
00:17:55,856 --> 00:17:58,886 A:middle
to be able to solve
some problems.

346
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,846 A:middle
The next scenario
we're going to look

347

348
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

349
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,846 A:middle
The next scenario
we're going to look

350
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,606 A:middle
at is how we can automate
document construction.

351
00:18:04,396 --> 00:18:07,906 A:middle
Now the thing about using
the automation technologies

352
00:18:07,906 --> 00:18:14,366 A:middle
in OS X is that they're very
powerful and they act as you,

353
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:17,686 A:middle
they act on your behalf
with all the authority

354
00:18:17,686 --> 00:18:19,426 A:middle
that you have as a user.

355
00:18:20,586 --> 00:18:23,966 A:middle
So you can do all the things

356
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:26,466 A:middle
that you normally do
through automation.

357
00:18:26,936 --> 00:18:30,476 A:middle
You can command and control
applications, you can copy data

358
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:34,356 A:middle
from one place to another, you
can create and delete files,

359
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:37,046 A:middle
you can mount volumes,
you can unmounts volumes,

360
00:18:37,736 --> 00:18:40,366 A:middle
pretty much anything that
you can do as a user,

361
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:43,326 A:middle
automation can do
on your behalf.

362
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:47,246 A:middle
And this is incredibly powerful
because when you combine

363
00:18:47,246 --> 00:18:50,516 A:middle
that with the fact that we
have some great scriptable

364
00:18:50,516 --> 00:18:55,026 A:middle
applications on OS X, then you
can really accomplish a lot

365
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:58,266 A:middle
and create very inventive,
useful solutions.

366
00:18:58,726 --> 00:19:00,716 A:middle
So here's a simple example.

367

368
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

369
00:18:58,726 --> 00:19:00,716 A:middle
So here's a simple example.

370
00:19:01,196 --> 00:19:04,656 A:middle
Let's say as part of
your daily or as part

371
00:19:04,656 --> 00:19:07,206 A:middle
of your job assignment,
I'll put it that way,

372
00:19:07,936 --> 00:19:10,696 A:middle
every Thursday you
have to gather the data

373
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,526 A:middle
about your company's
sales, you have to put it

374
00:19:14,526 --> 00:19:17,126 A:middle
into a presentation
that you deliver

375
00:19:17,126 --> 00:19:20,626 A:middle
to your teammates
every Thursday.

376
00:19:21,196 --> 00:19:23,906 A:middle
And this usually takes quite a
while to do because you've got

377
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:27,056 A:middle
to go gather the data, then
you have to transform it

378
00:19:27,056 --> 00:19:31,546 A:middle
from one shape of being
spreadsheet into being a chart,

379
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:33,616 A:middle
then you have to build
the presentation.

380
00:19:34,246 --> 00:19:37,356 A:middle
So here's an example of
how you can use automation

381
00:19:37,556 --> 00:19:39,286 A:middle
to automate that process.

382
00:19:39,726 --> 00:19:44,076 A:middle
Using Automator, you can
create a workflow for yourself

383
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:47,786 A:middle
that will automatically build
a presentation that grabs data

384
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:51,946 A:middle
out of other files, transforms
it into the things you need,

385
00:19:52,136 --> 00:19:55,446 A:middle
and then triggers the sending
of it to your iOS device,

386
00:19:55,496 --> 00:19:59,416 A:middle
so that all you have to do
is just accept the transfer

387
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,676 A:middle
from the computer and then

388

389
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

390
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,676 A:middle
from the computer and then

391
00:20:01,676 --> 00:20:07,136 A:middle
within a couple seconds you have
the presentation ready to go

392
00:20:07,136 --> 00:20:10,376 A:middle
that you can take
with you when you have

393
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:12,466 A:middle
to do your presentation
with your team.

394
00:20:13,406 --> 00:20:16,396 A:middle
So this is a simple
example of the power

395
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:18,256 A:middle
of creating a document.

396
00:20:18,516 --> 00:20:20,916 A:middle
So let me show you that, I'm
going to create a workflow

397
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,926 A:middle
that does just what we just saw.

398
00:20:23,496 --> 00:20:30,296 A:middle
And this is my desktop
that is the Martian sunset,

399
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:34,156 A:middle
NASA just released this photo,
it's totally incredible,

400
00:20:34,156 --> 00:20:36,666 A:middle
it just really makes
you feel small

401
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,046 A:middle
in the universe when
I look at that.

402
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:41,396 A:middle
Okay, so I'm going
to create a workflow

403
00:20:41,716 --> 00:20:45,036 A:middle
that generates a presentation
and incorporates data

404
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:50,636 A:middle
from a spreadsheet and then
sends it to my mobile device

405
00:20:50,636 --> 00:20:52,876 A:middle
that I have over
here via AirDrop.

406
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:57,006 A:middle
So I'm going to launch
Automator, and I'm going

407
00:20:57,006 --> 00:21:01,086 A:middle
to create a new document,
and let me just zoom this

408

409
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

410
00:20:57,006 --> 00:21:01,086 A:middle
to create a new document,
and let me just zoom this

411
00:21:01,086 --> 00:21:02,656 A:middle
so that we can see together.

412
00:21:02,806 --> 00:21:03,516 A:middle
How is that?

413
00:21:03,556 --> 00:21:04,496 A:middle
Much better isn't it?

414
00:21:04,886 --> 00:21:06,406 A:middle
So when you launch Automator,

415
00:21:06,406 --> 00:21:09,106 A:middle
you'll see that there's
a template picker here.

416
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:12,126 A:middle
For our purposes we're just
going to use a workflow

417
00:21:12,126 --> 00:21:15,026 A:middle
that I save into this
system-wide script menu

418
00:21:15,296 --> 00:21:17,296 A:middle
so that it's always
available for me.

419
00:21:17,566 --> 00:21:18,876 A:middle
So I'll click Choose.

420
00:21:19,616 --> 00:21:22,516 A:middle
Over on the left-hand
side is the library

421
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:26,046 A:middle
of Automator actions, those
are those individual nuggets

422
00:21:26,046 --> 00:21:28,516 A:middle
of functionality that
you combine together

423
00:21:28,726 --> 00:21:30,556 A:middle
to make an automation recipe.

424
00:21:30,926 --> 00:21:34,086 A:middle
And you can view them by
category, as it shows here,

425
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:37,026 A:middle
or you can even arrange
them by application.

426
00:21:37,026 --> 00:21:39,446 A:middle
I'm going to choose
application and then go

427
00:21:39,446 --> 00:21:42,896 A:middle
to the Keynote application
and click on that.

428
00:21:43,096 --> 00:21:45,776 A:middle
When I click on it, you can
see all the actions related

429
00:21:45,776 --> 00:21:47,726 A:middle
to Keynote are available
over here

430
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:51,506 A:middle
and whatever action I have
selected has a description

431
00:21:51,506 --> 00:21:52,956 A:middle
that appears here at the bottom

432
00:21:53,106 --> 00:21:55,176 A:middle
that gives me information
on how to use it.

433
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,966 A:middle
So let me create a workflow.

434
00:21:56,966 --> 00:22:00,066 A:middle
The first thing I'm going
to do is add an action

435

436
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

437
00:21:56,966 --> 00:22:00,066 A:middle
The first thing I'm going
to do is add an action

438
00:22:00,146 --> 00:22:02,566 A:middle
to the workflow area
by dragging in here

439
00:22:02,836 --> 00:22:04,666 A:middle
for creating a new presentation.

440
00:22:05,186 --> 00:22:08,146 A:middle
You can see that the action
view has various controls

441
00:22:08,146 --> 00:22:10,276 A:middle
and parameters for
deciding what kind

442
00:22:10,276 --> 00:22:12,146 A:middle
of presentation I
want to create.

443
00:22:12,346 --> 00:22:13,996 A:middle
I'm going to choose a gradient.

444
00:22:14,296 --> 00:22:16,656 A:middle
I'm going to choose its
dimensions to be set

445
00:22:16,656 --> 00:22:21,866 A:middle
for a mobile device, and I'll
just basically leave it at that.

446
00:22:22,346 --> 00:22:26,046 A:middle
So my first action is to
create the presentation.

447
00:22:26,506 --> 00:22:29,616 A:middle
Now when you create a default
presentation in Keynote,

448
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:33,206 A:middle
it gives you one slide
that is title and subtitle.

449
00:22:33,656 --> 00:22:37,306 A:middle
So the next step I want to
do is to set the contents

450
00:22:37,306 --> 00:22:38,856 A:middle
of the title and subtitle.

451
00:22:39,186 --> 00:22:43,426 A:middle
To do that I'm going to use
an action called Set Contents

452
00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:44,836 A:middle
of Default Text Items.

453
00:22:45,056 --> 00:22:46,066 A:middle
I drag it in.

454
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:48,466 A:middle
You notice that there's
a connection made

455
00:22:48,836 --> 00:22:52,266 A:middle
so that a reference to the
new presentation is passed

456
00:22:52,266 --> 00:22:53,116 A:middle
to this action.

457
00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:56,176 A:middle
It then knows which
presentation to work with.

458
00:22:56,596 --> 00:22:58,416 A:middle
I'm going to set it
so that the title

459
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:03,686 A:middle
of the presentation will
be Sales Report, like this.

460

461
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

462
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:03,686 A:middle
of the presentation will
be Sales Report, like this.

463
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:07,476 A:middle
And then for the subtitle
I want the current date.

464
00:23:08,116 --> 00:23:11,506 A:middle
And since I want this to be a
workflow that I can use over

465
00:23:11,506 --> 00:23:14,826 A:middle
and over again, I'm going
to use an Automator variable

466
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:17,506 A:middle
to dynamically generate
the date for me.

467
00:23:18,136 --> 00:23:21,496 A:middle
Over here on the library I'll
click the Variables category,

468
00:23:22,056 --> 00:23:26,026 A:middle
and variables are containers
of data, they can either be

469
00:23:26,026 --> 00:23:29,046 A:middle
from storing it or
dynamically generated.

470
00:23:29,386 --> 00:23:31,896 A:middle
So I'll click Date
and Time and then drag

471
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:36,246 A:middle
in today's date variable into
the body field over here.

472
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:40,716 A:middle
Now you'll notice that it
automatically gets added

473
00:23:40,716 --> 00:23:42,846 A:middle
into a list of variables
currently used

474
00:23:42,846 --> 00:23:44,356 A:middle
by the document at the bottom.

475
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:48,256 A:middle
I can set the parameters for how
the variable is going to appear

476
00:23:48,256 --> 00:23:51,796 A:middle
by clicking Edit and then
choosing a format that I'd like,

477
00:23:51,796 --> 00:23:56,066 A:middle
like this one where I have full
month, date, and then the year.

478
00:23:56,756 --> 00:24:02,876 A:middle
So my second slide, my second
task, the second action has been

479

480
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

481
00:23:56,756 --> 00:24:02,876 A:middle
So my second slide, my second
task, the second action has been

482
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:07,846 A:middle
to name the presentation
and provide a subtitle.

483
00:24:08,476 --> 00:24:12,336 A:middle
The next step is to apply a
transition for that slide.

484
00:24:12,336 --> 00:24:17,516 A:middle
So I'll go back to my actions
and I'll go drag in the action

485
00:24:17,516 --> 00:24:18,926 A:middle
for setting transition.

486
00:24:19,386 --> 00:24:23,196 A:middle
From that I'm going to choose
-- let's do a basic dissolve.

487
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:26,626 A:middle
I'll set it for about a
second and a half on click.

488
00:24:27,046 --> 00:24:28,686 A:middle
All right, now that
we've done that,

489
00:24:28,726 --> 00:24:31,036 A:middle
I'll need to create a
new slide that I'm going

490
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,586 A:middle
to add my sales data to.

491
00:24:33,966 --> 00:24:37,526 A:middle
And for this slide, I'm going
to create one that has a title

492
00:24:37,526 --> 00:24:41,016 A:middle
at the top and I'm going to add
it to the end of the slides.

493
00:24:41,476 --> 00:24:44,946 A:middle
So I have a new presentation,
I've titled it, subtitled it,

494
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:48,756 A:middle
created a transition for the
first slide, added a new slide.

495
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:52,486 A:middle
Now I'm ready to add the
data that I want to have

496
00:24:52,876 --> 00:24:58,106 A:middle
in my presentation, but this
data lives in another file.

497
00:24:58,106 --> 00:25:02,936 A:middle
I have a numbers spreadsheet
here that contains the data

498

499
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

500
00:24:58,106 --> 00:25:02,936 A:middle
I have a numbers spreadsheet
here that contains the data

501
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:06,436 A:middle
that I want to bring
into my presentation.

502
00:25:06,776 --> 00:25:08,436 A:middle
So I'm going to close that

503
00:25:08,436 --> 00:25:11,386 A:middle
and use an action
here called Add Chart

504
00:25:12,396 --> 00:25:15,606 A:middle
with Numbers Table Data,
drag it into my workflow,

505
00:25:15,886 --> 00:25:19,576 A:middle
and you can see that the action
view has two areas for settings,

506
00:25:19,856 --> 00:25:22,396 A:middle
the Data Settings and
the Chart Settings.

507
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:25,936 A:middle
So we're going to pick the
file that I want to use,

508
00:25:25,936 --> 00:25:29,526 A:middle
it will be in my Documents
folder, and here it is,

509
00:25:29,526 --> 00:25:33,796 A:middle
ACME Widget Domestic Sales --
bring that over a little bit,

510
00:25:33,796 --> 00:25:36,866 A:middle
like that -- and then I
can choose to identify

511
00:25:36,866 --> 00:25:38,716 A:middle
which table in that document.

512
00:25:38,716 --> 00:25:42,096 A:middle
I can use the active table, a
selection of the active table,

513
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,656 A:middle
I can use the first table
that's on the active sheet,

514
00:25:45,656 --> 00:25:49,376 A:middle
or I can even enter a name
for the table and it will find

515
00:25:49,376 --> 00:25:50,726 A:middle
that table in the document.

516
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,206 A:middle
I'm going to use first
table of active sheet,

517
00:25:53,496 --> 00:25:56,876 A:middle
and I want to use the table
title for the slide title.

518
00:25:57,436 --> 00:25:58,886 A:middle
Now when it comes to a chart,

519
00:25:58,886 --> 00:26:01,706 A:middle
I'm going to pick something
very standard like a 2D,

520

521
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

522
00:25:58,886 --> 00:26:01,706 A:middle
I'm going to pick something
very standard like a 2D,

523
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:04,536 A:middle
I'm going to group it by
column data like this.

524
00:26:05,046 --> 00:26:08,286 A:middle
So now I've created a
presentation, I've titled it,

525
00:26:08,286 --> 00:26:11,346 A:middle
subtitled it, applied a
transition, added a new slide,

526
00:26:11,566 --> 00:26:15,296 A:middle
imported data from a file,
formatted into a chart,

527
00:26:15,296 --> 00:26:17,006 A:middle
added that chart to a slide.

528
00:26:17,456 --> 00:26:23,086 A:middle
The next step is I will save
this document using a Save

529
00:26:23,086 --> 00:26:25,636 A:middle
Document action, I'm going
to save it to a folder,

530
00:26:26,216 --> 00:26:28,506 A:middle
and I'm going to save it
to my Documents folder.

531
00:26:28,756 --> 00:26:31,506 A:middle
And for its name I'm going
to call it Sales Report,

532
00:26:32,196 --> 00:26:35,926 A:middle
and then I want the file
name to have the same name

533
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:39,246 A:middle
as the variable, so I'll
drag the variable from here

534
00:26:39,246 --> 00:26:43,756 A:middle
up into this field, so now the
file will be named Sales Report

535
00:26:43,826 --> 00:26:49,396 A:middle
and the current date.key and
replace any existing file.

536
00:26:49,966 --> 00:26:56,196 A:middle
And then, finally, I have over
here my little iPad ready to go,

537
00:26:56,406 --> 00:27:00,176 A:middle
and I have it set up with
AirDrop, so let's make it easy

538

539
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

540
00:26:56,406 --> 00:27:00,176 A:middle
and I have it set up with
AirDrop, so let's make it easy

541
00:27:00,646 --> 00:27:02,716 A:middle
to get that file over here.

542
00:27:03,526 --> 00:27:08,646 A:middle
I'm going to go begin AirDrop
with disk items, and I'll extend

543
00:27:08,646 --> 00:27:11,736 A:middle
out the AirDrop for a
couple seconds extra just

544
00:27:11,736 --> 00:27:13,376 A:middle
in case we need it.

545
00:27:13,376 --> 00:27:15,856 A:middle
And what this will do is
at the end of the workflow,

546
00:27:15,856 --> 00:27:17,416 A:middle
it will take the
file that's created

547
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:20,446 A:middle
and automatically begin an
AirDrop so that I can see it

548
00:27:20,446 --> 00:27:22,656 A:middle
over on my iPad and
receive it there.

549
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:26,786 A:middle
So I would save this,
I would place this

550
00:27:26,786 --> 00:27:31,116 A:middle
into the Scripts folder,
I would find a location

551
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,166 A:middle
that I like to keep it.

552
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:35,416 A:middle
And then once it's saved, it
becomes part of your script

553
00:27:35,416 --> 00:27:37,206 A:middle
and you can choose
it at any time.

554
00:27:38,706 --> 00:27:42,426 A:middle
I'll run the workflow so that
you can see it run in action,

555
00:27:42,866 --> 00:27:46,416 A:middle
right from here, let me
zoom back out a little bit.

556
00:27:47,836 --> 00:27:52,566 A:middle
And I will run this workflow, it
will generate the sales report,

557
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:56,856 A:middle
grab the data, bring it in,
and begin the AirDrop session,

558
00:27:57,576 --> 00:28:02,736 A:middle
and there's the Woodbury School,
so now I'll click over to three.

559

560
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

561
00:27:57,576 --> 00:28:02,736 A:middle
and there's the Woodbury School,
so now I'll click over to three.

562
00:28:03,756 --> 00:28:07,936 A:middle
You can see, yes, you can see
here I'm going to accept this,

563
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:11,296 A:middle
and it's going to copy
it right into Keynote.

564
00:28:12,026 --> 00:28:16,166 A:middle
I can bring it in, I can do
editing because the power

565
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:18,926 A:middle
of iWork I can make it a
little bit more colorful.

566
00:28:19,436 --> 00:28:21,886 A:middle
And then I actually have
my presentation here

567
00:28:22,736 --> 00:28:26,486 A:middle
and I can begin delivering --
it's going to give me some tips,

568
00:28:26,986 --> 00:28:30,226 A:middle
and get to the next
presentation.

569
00:28:30,556 --> 00:28:38,096 A:middle
So there's an example of how you
can create a workflow using the

570
00:28:38,096 --> 00:28:42,736 A:middle
power of OS X -- let's
go back to one --

571
00:28:44,116 --> 00:28:47,256 A:middle
so here's how you can create
a workflow using the power

572
00:28:47,256 --> 00:28:51,806 A:middle
of the automation technologies
in OS X to make the process

573
00:28:51,806 --> 00:28:56,546 A:middle
of creating a chart and
a presentation as simple

574
00:28:56,546 --> 00:28:59,936 A:middle
as just going to a menu and
selecting that option for you.

575

576
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

577
00:29:00,786 --> 00:29:02,896 A:middle
Okay, so let's go
back to slides here.

578
00:29:03,486 --> 00:29:05,106 A:middle
[Applause] Oh, thank you.

579
00:29:05,506 --> 00:29:11,686 A:middle
So how do we get
back over there?

580
00:29:12,146 --> 00:29:13,426 A:middle
You guys do that, magic.

581
00:29:14,406 --> 00:29:15,736 A:middle
Isn't it interesting?

582
00:29:15,736 --> 00:29:17,396 A:middle
I'll bet you most of
you didn't realize

583
00:29:17,396 --> 00:29:19,446 A:middle
that stuff was actually
in the OS, huh?

584
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:25,586 A:middle
Right? Okay, so this
example uses all

585
00:29:25,586 --> 00:29:29,576 A:middle
of our automation technologies
that you have available to you.

586
00:29:29,746 --> 00:29:32,666 A:middle
And remember, they act
on your behalf with all

587
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:36,856 A:middle
of your authority, so you're
not limited by what you can do.

588
00:29:37,106 --> 00:29:39,856 A:middle
You don't need a specific
app for each step of it,

589
00:29:40,026 --> 00:29:41,806 A:middle
all you need is the
functionality

590
00:29:41,806 --> 00:29:44,666 A:middle
that can be exposed to
you through Automator.

591
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,926 A:middle
And you have some great apps
to work with, like iWork

592
00:29:47,926 --> 00:29:50,406 A:middle
and Photos, the Finder
and FileMaker Pro,

593
00:29:50,586 --> 00:29:52,676 A:middle
you can create incredible
solutions.

594
00:29:54,136 --> 00:29:57,406 A:middle
And this example with
the Automator actions

595
00:29:57,476 --> 00:30:00,566 A:middle
and the whole complete
examples available for you today

596

597
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

598
00:29:57,476 --> 00:30:00,566 A:middle
and the whole complete
examples available for you today

599
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,976 A:middle
at iworkautomation.com.

600
00:30:03,156 --> 00:30:05,726 A:middle
It's a website that
contains individual websites

601
00:30:05,726 --> 00:30:08,766 A:middle
about pages, numbers,
and Keynote.

602
00:30:09,086 --> 00:30:12,096 A:middle
I think you'll find it
useful in an informative way.

603
00:30:13,506 --> 00:30:16,436 A:middle
Okay, so that's Automating
Document Construction.

604
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:20,036 A:middle
And for our last example we're
going to try something new,

605
00:30:20,456 --> 00:30:22,356 A:middle
this will be the first
time I'm demoing this,

606
00:30:22,356 --> 00:30:24,616 A:middle
it's the first time
anybody has seen this,

607
00:30:24,996 --> 00:30:26,806 A:middle
and you guys are the ones
that are going to see it.

608
00:30:27,186 --> 00:30:30,446 A:middle
We're going to talk about
setting up iOS devices.

609
00:30:31,116 --> 00:30:33,296 A:middle
Now there could be no doubt

610
00:30:33,576 --> 00:30:37,386 A:middle
that Apple makes the
most incredibly powerful

611
00:30:37,386 --> 00:30:41,906 A:middle
and sophisticated and elegant
mobile devices there are.

612
00:30:42,346 --> 00:30:46,386 A:middle
They are wonderful tools for the
enterprise, they're attractive,

613
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:49,926 A:middle
they're powerful,
they're easy to use.

614
00:30:50,326 --> 00:30:52,076 A:middle
And with our partnership now

615
00:30:52,076 --> 00:30:57,906 A:middle
with IBM we are creating
best-of-class applications

616
00:30:57,906 --> 00:31:02,266 A:middle
for data deployment to put the
power of the enterprise right

617

618
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

619
00:30:57,906 --> 00:31:02,266 A:middle
for data deployment to put the
power of the enterprise right

620
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:05,786 A:middle
at your staff's hands
and fingers.

621
00:31:06,196 --> 00:31:09,366 A:middle
And it's really incredible
what the tools

622
00:31:09,366 --> 00:31:12,276 A:middle
that are being produced
through this collaboration.

623
00:31:14,346 --> 00:31:19,446 A:middle
And we really are happy with
what is being developed,

624
00:31:19,886 --> 00:31:22,986 A:middle
but let's talk about for a
second, not data deployment,

625
00:31:22,986 --> 00:31:24,886 A:middle
but device deployment.

626
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,646 A:middle
So when it comes to
device deployment,

627
00:31:27,646 --> 00:31:30,206 A:middle
there's usually two
strategies that you follow.

628
00:31:30,606 --> 00:31:32,846 A:middle
The first is called One to One,

629
00:31:33,256 --> 00:31:36,706 A:middle
and in One to One you
have a group of employees

630
00:31:36,796 --> 00:31:39,106 A:middle
that are given a mobile device

631
00:31:39,156 --> 00:31:42,676 A:middle
that is profiled
specifically for them.

632
00:31:43,176 --> 00:31:46,946 A:middle
It contains information about
them, it is targeted to them,

633
00:31:47,246 --> 00:31:50,426 A:middle
so that no matter where they
move within your organization

634
00:31:50,686 --> 00:31:57,096 A:middle
or within geographic location
that device stays with them.

635
00:31:58,066 --> 00:31:59,886 A:middle
Now the second strategy

636
00:31:59,886 --> 00:32:03,436 A:middle
for device deployment
is called Shared Use,

637

638
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

639
00:31:59,886 --> 00:32:03,436 A:middle
for device deployment
is called Shared Use,

640
00:32:03,906 --> 00:32:06,906 A:middle
and in this scenario you
have a set of devices

641
00:32:07,136 --> 00:32:10,436 A:middle
that are configured
generically for your company

642
00:32:10,526 --> 00:32:15,056 A:middle
as the identifier, and then your
staff uses those as they need

643
00:32:15,326 --> 00:32:18,626 A:middle
and then passes them to
other members of your staff

644
00:32:18,626 --> 00:32:21,846 A:middle
who will use them and then
pass them to other members

645
00:32:21,846 --> 00:32:24,546 A:middle
of your staff that gets
to use them as well.

646
00:32:24,756 --> 00:32:29,026 A:middle
So shared use, you have a
limited number of mobile devices

647
00:32:29,346 --> 00:32:31,856 A:middle
that get used by a
large variety of people,

648
00:32:32,336 --> 00:32:36,166 A:middle
as compared to a
one-to-one scenario

649
00:32:36,266 --> 00:32:39,426 A:middle
where every employee gets
their own mobile device.

650
00:32:39,836 --> 00:32:42,706 A:middle
Now in shared use,
a couple scenarios

651
00:32:42,706 --> 00:32:45,446 A:middle
that quite often
happen with shared use,

652
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:50,116 A:middle
are you'll see them used in
professional organizations,

653
00:32:50,606 --> 00:32:53,796 A:middle
you'll see them used in
service organizations,

654
00:32:54,296 --> 00:32:58,796 A:middle
and you'll also see them
used in classrooms as well.

655

656
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

657
00:33:00,486 --> 00:33:04,196 A:middle
Many classrooms use a limited
number of mobile devices

658
00:33:04,246 --> 00:33:07,426 A:middle
that they format and set
up for different classes

659
00:33:07,426 --> 00:33:09,096 A:middle
and different use
throughout the school.

660
00:33:10,086 --> 00:33:13,586 A:middle
So with both Shared
Use and One to One,

661
00:33:13,586 --> 00:33:16,796 A:middle
Apple has some great solutions
for device management.

662
00:33:16,796 --> 00:33:20,226 A:middle
For One to One, we have our
device enrollment program

663
00:33:20,526 --> 00:33:22,666 A:middle
and we have the volume
purchase program.

664
00:33:22,966 --> 00:33:26,286 A:middle
That really makes just
a simple setup process:

665
00:33:26,286 --> 00:33:29,436 A:middle
you turn on the device
and connects to a network,

666
00:33:29,656 --> 00:33:32,606 A:middle
it will set itself up for
that employee automatically.

667
00:33:33,526 --> 00:33:36,636 A:middle
When it comes to Shared
Use we have an application,

668
00:33:37,076 --> 00:33:39,086 A:middle
it's called Apple Configurator.

669
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:43,816 A:middle
And Apple Configurator is
the application that you use

670
00:33:43,816 --> 00:33:47,956 A:middle
to connect to hardware
controllers like this

671
00:33:48,316 --> 00:33:54,626 A:middle
or like carts like this so that
you can have it manage hundreds

672
00:33:54,706 --> 00:33:57,786 A:middle
or dozens of devices
simultaneously.

673
00:33:58,366 --> 00:34:01,426 A:middle
You connect your computer
to the hardware controller

674

675
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

676
00:33:58,366 --> 00:34:01,426 A:middle
You connect your computer
to the hardware controller

677
00:34:01,896 --> 00:34:05,666 A:middle
and then you run the software
to manage that device.

678
00:34:06,286 --> 00:34:10,476 A:middle
On Tuesday we announced a
brand-new reimagined version

679
00:34:10,766 --> 00:34:14,025 A:middle
of Apple Configurator
with the incredible name

680
00:34:14,025 --> 00:34:16,156 A:middle
of Apple Configurator 2.

681
00:34:17,476 --> 00:34:22,496 A:middle
And this look and feel of this
application is very interesting.

682
00:34:22,496 --> 00:34:27,485 A:middle
It now has a very nice graphical
flow to it, it's a lot easier

683
00:34:27,485 --> 00:34:32,896 A:middle
to use, and imagine the
controls, they're visual,

684
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:37,406 A:middle
and they've done a really good
job at taking the complexity

685
00:34:37,646 --> 00:34:43,196 A:middle
of the processes for setting up
devices and made them logical

686
00:34:43,565 --> 00:34:46,815 A:middle
and attractive in
appearance to use.

687
00:34:47,606 --> 00:34:52,946 A:middle
Now even this application, as
smooth as it is, still requires

688
00:34:52,946 --> 00:34:55,856 A:middle
that you have some basic
knowledge of terminology

689
00:34:56,315 --> 00:35:00,096 A:middle
and the intricacies of
managing mobile devices.

690

691
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

692
00:34:56,315 --> 00:35:00,096 A:middle
and the intricacies of
managing mobile devices.

693
00:35:00,486 --> 00:35:04,166 A:middle
This requires you to understand
these various concepts,

694
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:08,056 A:middle
and for you guys that's
not really an issue

695
00:35:08,516 --> 00:35:12,736 A:middle
because you're all
award-winning IT professionals,

696
00:35:13,046 --> 00:35:16,646 A:middle
you have your crack staffs
and for you complexity, ah,

697
00:35:17,146 --> 00:35:19,016 A:middle
it's no big deal, you can drop

698
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,176 A:middle
into the command line
anytime you need.

699
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:25,906 A:middle
But it just so happens that in
large organizations it's quite

700
00:35:25,906 --> 00:35:29,396 A:middle
often a reality that
the people who end

701
00:35:29,396 --> 00:35:34,456 A:middle
up managing devices really
don't have a great depth

702
00:35:34,456 --> 00:35:37,126 A:middle
of knowledge about IT issues.

703
00:35:38,046 --> 00:35:42,196 A:middle
So we call them, like,
accidental administrators.

704
00:35:42,536 --> 00:35:47,446 A:middle
It might be someone who
assumes a role or assumes a task

705
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:50,336 A:middle
because another person has
moved to a different part

706
00:35:50,336 --> 00:35:54,076 A:middle
in the company, or organizations
might merge together

707
00:35:54,576 --> 00:35:57,026 A:middle
and people assume
new responsibilities.

708
00:35:57,436 --> 00:36:01,996 A:middle
So your challenge as an IT
professional is to create tools

709

710
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

711
00:35:57,436 --> 00:36:01,996 A:middle
So your challenge as an IT
professional is to create tools

712
00:36:01,996 --> 00:36:05,326 A:middle
that will solve these people's
problems and allow them

713
00:36:05,326 --> 00:36:06,966 A:middle
to set up mobile devices.

714
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:11,706 A:middle
And, fortunately, new
Apple Configurator 2 comes

715
00:36:11,706 --> 00:36:13,326 A:middle
with Automator support.

716
00:36:14,966 --> 00:36:20,196 A:middle
And you as the IT professional
can use that Automator support

717
00:36:20,766 --> 00:36:25,436 A:middle
to easily create Automator
workflows that will go

718
00:36:25,436 --> 00:36:31,796 A:middle
through the various steps to set
up and configure mobile devices

719
00:36:32,656 --> 00:36:36,066 A:middle
and do the various actions
and the complexities

720
00:36:36,066 --> 00:36:40,976 A:middle
and the authentications and all
of the other interesting things

721
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:44,706 A:middle
that have to be done in
order to set up a device.

722
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:49,306 A:middle
And these actions will
run in order from the top

723
00:36:49,306 --> 00:36:51,686 A:middle
of your workflow down to
the bottom of your workflow,

724
00:36:51,686 --> 00:36:55,806 A:middle
they're executed, passing
along data as they work.

725
00:36:56,386 --> 00:36:59,216 A:middle
And then it's just a
matter of you being able

726
00:36:59,216 --> 00:37:04,496 A:middle
to save this workflow to the
Script folder on your computer,

727

728
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

729
00:36:59,216 --> 00:37:04,496 A:middle
to save this workflow to the
Script folder on your computer,

730
00:37:05,336 --> 00:37:07,136 A:middle
and then it will
become installed

731
00:37:07,136 --> 00:37:09,606 A:middle
and ready to use by others.

732
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:12,246 A:middle
So when the workflow
gets installed

733
00:37:12,246 --> 00:37:14,976 A:middle
into the Scripts folder, it
becomes part of the Script menu,

734
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:16,766 A:middle
so that anybody that's using

735
00:37:16,766 --> 00:37:21,156 A:middle
that management computer just
merely needs to connect devices,

736
00:37:21,336 --> 00:37:26,896 A:middle
go to the Script menu, and then
choose one of the setup scripts

737
00:37:26,896 --> 00:37:29,786 A:middle
that you have created
through Automator,

738
00:37:30,256 --> 00:37:34,086 A:middle
one of the setup workflows,
and then let the process begin

739
00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:40,116 A:middle
and manage the device, either
setting it up or configuring it,

740
00:37:40,206 --> 00:37:41,446 A:middle
and everybody is happy.

741
00:37:42,406 --> 00:37:46,126 A:middle
So let's take a look
at a specific scenario.

742
00:37:46,126 --> 00:37:48,956 A:middle
I'm going to create a
workflow and set up a device

743
00:37:48,956 --> 00:37:52,926 A:middle
for you here, and in
this scenario we're going

744
00:37:52,926 --> 00:37:56,476 A:middle
to have a -- we're going to
create an Automator workflow

745
00:37:56,676 --> 00:38:01,496 A:middle
that will automatically install
required documents onto iPads.

746

747
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

748
00:37:56,676 --> 00:38:01,496 A:middle
that will automatically install
required documents onto iPads.

749
00:38:01,806 --> 00:38:04,266 A:middle
So in this scenario let's
say we have a school

750
00:38:04,266 --> 00:38:06,626 A:middle
that we're working with,
we're going to want to copy

751
00:38:06,626 --> 00:38:09,876 A:middle
across the book report
template, the student handbook,

752
00:38:09,876 --> 00:38:14,976 A:middle
the student presentation
template, those kind of things.

753
00:38:15,186 --> 00:38:16,766 A:middle
So we're going to
create a workflow

754
00:38:16,926 --> 00:38:18,956 A:middle
that will allow administrators

755
00:38:18,956 --> 00:38:22,516 A:middle
to easily transfer
documents over to iPads.

756
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:27,446 A:middle
So let's take a look
at that now.

757
00:38:29,236 --> 00:38:33,386 A:middle
There we go, let's launch
Automator, and I'm going to zoom

758
00:38:33,386 --> 00:38:36,116 A:middle
into this so you can see a
little bit better as we do this.

759
00:38:36,496 --> 00:38:39,936 A:middle
Again, I could choose
to create a variety

760
00:38:39,936 --> 00:38:43,616 A:middle
of Automator workflow
types, like workflow,

761
00:38:43,616 --> 00:38:46,826 A:middle
a self-running application, a
system service, a print plug-in,

762
00:38:47,006 --> 00:38:50,046 A:middle
a folder action, calendar,
alarm, image capture plug-in,

763
00:38:50,046 --> 00:38:53,196 A:middle
or a dictation command, but for
our purposes we're just going

764
00:38:53,196 --> 00:38:55,146 A:middle
to use a standard workflow file

765
00:38:55,426 --> 00:38:57,966 A:middle
that we can have installed
into the Script menu.

766
00:38:58,666 --> 00:39:00,216 A:middle
Over on the left-hand side,

767

768
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

769
00:38:58,666 --> 00:39:00,216 A:middle
Over on the left-hand side,

770
00:39:00,216 --> 00:39:03,746 A:middle
I'm going to choose Apple
Configurator as the category

771
00:39:03,746 --> 00:39:06,866 A:middle
that I'm going to be
drawing my actions from,

772
00:39:07,336 --> 00:39:08,726 A:middle
and then it's just a matter

773
00:39:08,726 --> 00:39:12,426 A:middle
of putting together
the various steps.

774
00:39:12,606 --> 00:39:14,646 A:middle
So the first thing you do
when you create a workflow

775
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:18,056 A:middle
that involves setting up
mobile devices is to identify

776
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:20,086 A:middle
which devices you
want to work with.

777
00:39:20,206 --> 00:39:22,536 A:middle
So we have two actions
for doing that,

778
00:39:22,536 --> 00:39:24,436 A:middle
you have Choose Connected
Devices,

779
00:39:24,436 --> 00:39:27,216 A:middle
which would interactively
present you a list,

780
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:31,056 A:middle
or we're going to use the one
called Get Connected Devices.

781
00:39:31,056 --> 00:39:34,286 A:middle
I'll drag it into my
workflow area, and you can see

782
00:39:34,286 --> 00:39:37,956 A:middle
that in the action view I
can choose iPads, iPhones,

783
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:42,656 A:middle
iPod touches, or Apple TVs,
so I can have multiple types

784
00:39:42,656 --> 00:39:44,646 A:middle
of devices connected and filter

785
00:39:44,646 --> 00:39:46,496 A:middle
out the ones that
I'm looking for.

786
00:39:46,776 --> 00:39:48,066 A:middle
We're going to choose iPad.

787
00:39:48,616 --> 00:39:52,656 A:middle
Then once I've identified the
devices this action will pass a

788
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:56,616 A:middle
reference to those devices to
the next action, which is going

789
00:39:56,616 --> 00:39:58,916 A:middle
to be to copy some
documents over.

790
00:39:59,186 --> 00:40:02,486 A:middle
So I have an action here
called Copy Documents

791

792
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

793
00:39:59,186 --> 00:40:02,486 A:middle
So I have an action here
called Copy Documents

794
00:40:02,486 --> 00:40:04,636 A:middle
to Devices, I drag that in.

795
00:40:05,546 --> 00:40:10,706 A:middle
In iOS a document is
associated with a specific app,

796
00:40:11,206 --> 00:40:15,466 A:middle
so you have to identify
what application is going

797
00:40:15,466 --> 00:40:17,546 A:middle
to be associated
with these documents.

798
00:40:18,046 --> 00:40:20,936 A:middle
And there's two ways to do that,
you can pick it from the list

799
00:40:20,936 --> 00:40:24,406 A:middle
of installed applications on
this computer or you can enter

800
00:40:24,406 --> 00:40:26,496 A:middle
in the iOS app ID, here.

801
00:40:26,996 --> 00:40:29,446 A:middle
We're going to choose
pick from the list.

802
00:40:29,446 --> 00:40:32,366 A:middle
I'm going to choose the first
one, Adobe Acrobat Reader,

803
00:40:32,706 --> 00:40:39,036 A:middle
and then I'm going to click
this to locate the documents.

804
00:40:39,076 --> 00:40:40,576 A:middle
In this case I want PDFs,

805
00:40:40,576 --> 00:40:43,696 A:middle
I'm going to choose the student
handbook, yes, and I'm going

806
00:40:43,696 --> 00:40:45,806 A:middle
to choose the student
newsletter, okay, good.

807
00:40:46,096 --> 00:40:47,826 A:middle
So I'll select these two,

808
00:40:48,376 --> 00:40:52,376 A:middle
and these two have now been
associated with this application

809
00:40:52,506 --> 00:40:55,136 A:middle
and will copy across
to the device.

810
00:40:55,456 --> 00:40:58,136 A:middle
Now here's a tip, as
administrator you might want

811
00:40:58,136 --> 00:41:00,656 A:middle
to go back into this
workflow again sometime,

812

813
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

814
00:40:58,136 --> 00:41:00,656 A:middle
to go back into this
workflow again sometime,

815
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:05,566 A:middle
hold down the right key, the
Control key, right-click this

816
00:41:05,746 --> 00:41:09,406 A:middle
and go rename, and you can add
a comment into the action title.

817
00:41:09,446 --> 00:41:14,996 A:middle
So I'm going to say
Install Student Handbook,

818
00:41:16,186 --> 00:41:18,936 A:middle
and then hit the
-- oh, handbook --

819
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:23,426 A:middle
nothing is going to help me
with my spelling, handbook.

820
00:41:24,546 --> 00:41:26,066 A:middle
And now I can collapse that.

821
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:29,826 A:middle
So I have Get Connected Devices,
Install Student Handbook.

822
00:41:30,096 --> 00:41:31,886 A:middle
Let's add this action again.

823
00:41:32,186 --> 00:41:35,026 A:middle
This time I'm going to
choose as an application,

824
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:37,016 A:middle
I'm going to choose
the Pages application.

825
00:41:37,446 --> 00:41:40,226 A:middle
I'll go back here, select
it again, and I'm going

826
00:41:40,226 --> 00:41:42,696 A:middle
to choose the book
report template,

827
00:41:43,796 --> 00:41:46,906 A:middle
and I'll right-click
the title bar

828
00:41:46,906 --> 00:41:52,756 A:middle
and go Install Book
Report, very good.

829
00:41:52,756 --> 00:41:57,856 A:middle
And then I'm going to add the
action one more time over here,

830
00:41:57,856 --> 00:42:01,826 A:middle
and I'm going to choose Keynote
as the associated application,

831

832
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

833
00:41:57,856 --> 00:42:01,826 A:middle
and I'm going to choose Keynote
as the associated application,

834
00:42:02,576 --> 00:42:04,876 A:middle
choose Add, and then we're going

835
00:42:04,876 --> 00:42:09,206 A:middle
to find the photo slideshow
template, choose that,

836
00:42:09,936 --> 00:42:12,806 A:middle
right-click the title bar
so I can give myself a name.

837
00:42:12,806 --> 00:42:18,856 A:middle
I go Install Photo
Slideshow, very good.

838
00:42:19,126 --> 00:42:20,946 A:middle
So there's my simple workflow,

839
00:42:21,186 --> 00:42:23,086 A:middle
so if those documents
are required

840
00:42:23,086 --> 00:42:27,166 A:middle
in all my devices now I have
a workflow that can be run

841
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:29,336 A:middle
by my accidental administrators

842
00:42:29,596 --> 00:42:33,516 A:middle
to automatically copy all
the required documents over.

843
00:42:33,816 --> 00:42:36,996 A:middle
I can come back to this
workflow later and update it

844
00:42:36,996 --> 00:42:38,926 A:middle
with new documents if I want to.

845
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:40,526 A:middle
One more thing.

846
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:44,956 A:middle
I often find it useful that
when you're creating workflows

847
00:42:44,956 --> 00:42:48,686 A:middle
for others that you give
them a confirmation dialogue

848
00:42:48,686 --> 00:42:51,816 A:middle
at the beginning and end
of the workflow process.

849
00:42:52,276 --> 00:42:55,526 A:middle
So I have a script here
that does that for me,

850
00:42:55,526 --> 00:42:58,006 A:middle
that adds in confirmation
actions,

851
00:42:58,306 --> 00:43:00,546 A:middle
so when the workflow is
run you'll get this kind

852

853
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

854
00:42:58,306 --> 00:43:00,546 A:middle
so when the workflow is
run you'll get this kind

855
00:43:00,546 --> 00:43:02,666 A:middle
of confirmation action here.

856
00:43:03,336 --> 00:43:06,326 A:middle
Now I have my iPad
connected over here,

857
00:43:06,326 --> 00:43:08,576 A:middle
I'm going to copy this across.

858
00:43:09,066 --> 00:43:11,386 A:middle
Let's see if the
network holds up today.

859
00:43:11,386 --> 00:43:14,076 A:middle
We're going to actually run
this workflow right now.

860
00:43:14,606 --> 00:43:19,466 A:middle
So here's my confirmation,
and it's beginning the process

861
00:43:19,616 --> 00:43:21,436 A:middle
of identifying the devices.

862
00:43:22,936 --> 00:43:27,876 A:middle
It's now copying across
the first set of handbooks,

863
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:32,216 A:middle
and now it's copying
across the book report,

864
00:43:32,896 --> 00:43:35,796 A:middle
and now it's copying
across the Keynote document,

865
00:43:36,706 --> 00:43:39,276 A:middle
and now it's confirmed
to me that it is done.

866
00:43:39,876 --> 00:43:44,986 A:middle
So let's go over to number
three, number three is showing

867
00:43:44,986 --> 00:43:46,446 A:middle
up over here -- yes, okay,

868
00:43:46,446 --> 00:43:49,106 A:middle
so here's our Woodbury
Middle School pad,

869
00:43:49,356 --> 00:43:53,156 A:middle
if I go to the Acrobat
Reader you can see that, hey,

870
00:43:53,156 --> 00:43:55,946 A:middle
there's the student
handbook, indeed,

871
00:43:56,376 --> 00:43:58,286 A:middle
and here's the student
newsletter

872
00:43:58,426 --> 00:44:00,876 A:middle
that they can read, very good.

873

874
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

875
00:43:58,426 --> 00:44:00,876 A:middle
that they can read, very good.

876
00:44:01,336 --> 00:44:05,806 A:middle
And if I go to Pages,
I can import

877
00:44:05,806 --> 00:44:11,516 A:middle
that new book report template
into here, I'll tap it, hey,

878
00:44:11,516 --> 00:44:13,946 A:middle
and there's a place you can
add your picture as a student.

879
00:44:13,946 --> 00:44:17,436 A:middle
I'm going to choose take
photo, reverse the camera,

880
00:44:17,766 --> 00:44:24,316 A:middle
hold it on myself, use the
photo, it gets transferred in,

881
00:44:24,606 --> 00:44:26,406 A:middle
crazy man making a book report.

882
00:44:27,256 --> 00:44:29,856 A:middle
And then, finally, I'm
going to go to Keynote here

883
00:44:29,856 --> 00:44:35,096 A:middle
and you can see, I'll click Add,
and here is our photo slideshow

884
00:44:35,096 --> 00:44:38,636 A:middle
for students using the official
Woodbury School template,

885
00:44:39,166 --> 00:44:40,346 A:middle
so I launch that.

886
00:44:41,306 --> 00:44:44,296 A:middle
And then I can add a
slide from the template,

887
00:44:44,616 --> 00:44:48,746 A:middle
and as long as we're doing that
let's add in a picture here,

888
00:44:48,826 --> 00:44:54,986 A:middle
let's pick this one, double tap,
call that Wind Power like that,

889
00:44:54,986 --> 00:44:57,536 A:middle
give that a capital, Power.

890
00:44:58,836 --> 00:45:00,096 A:middle
Spell, Sal, spell.

891

892
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

893
00:44:58,836 --> 00:45:00,096 A:middle
Spell, Sal, spell.

894
00:45:01,236 --> 00:45:01,776 A:middle
Very good.

895
00:45:02,296 --> 00:45:04,116 A:middle
So there's the template.

896
00:45:04,546 --> 00:45:11,256 A:middle
So anytime that our accidental
administrators need to use

897
00:45:11,756 --> 00:45:14,526 A:middle
or configure some devices,
they just connect it,

898
00:45:14,526 --> 00:45:16,666 A:middle
they go over to the Script menu,

899
00:45:17,066 --> 00:45:20,146 A:middle
and they go over to the
Script menu on the computer,

900
00:45:20,406 --> 00:45:22,966 A:middle
choose Woodbury School,
and they can pick from any

901
00:45:22,966 --> 00:45:25,076 A:middle
of the various things
that they have set up.

902
00:45:25,426 --> 00:45:27,936 A:middle
Now I want to show
you one other thing.

903
00:45:27,936 --> 00:45:31,456 A:middle
I'm going to choose this Rename
and Wallpaper workflow and open

904
00:45:31,456 --> 00:45:33,926 A:middle
that up over here for us
to examine a little bit.

905
00:45:34,786 --> 00:45:38,996 A:middle
One of the things about any
workflow is customization.

906
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:42,316 A:middle
You might not find all the
actions that you're looking

907
00:45:42,316 --> 00:45:49,696 A:middle
for within a particular library
of actions, but the advantage is

908
00:45:50,046 --> 00:45:52,066 A:middle
that since you're
using a variety

909
00:45:52,066 --> 00:45:58,176 A:middle
of automation technologies, you
can use the AppleScript library

910
00:45:58,366 --> 00:46:02,816 A:middle
that the Apple Configurator,
Automator actions are based upon

911

912
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

913
00:45:58,366 --> 00:46:02,816 A:middle
that the Apple Configurator,
Automator actions are based upon

914
00:46:03,056 --> 00:46:05,756 A:middle
to create your own
customized scripts

915
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:08,406 A:middle
that you can insert
into the workflow.

916
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:13,956 A:middle
This particular script here will
name the device a default name,

917
00:46:13,956 --> 00:46:17,936 A:middle
like Woodbury School, and then
add, append its serial number

918
00:46:17,936 --> 00:46:21,016 A:middle
to it as well, or any other
information that you want.

919
00:46:21,206 --> 00:46:23,376 A:middle
So this is what the
script for that type

920
00:46:23,376 --> 00:46:25,156 A:middle
of thing would actually look at.

921
00:46:26,156 --> 00:46:28,156 A:middle
Okay, let's go back
to our slides.

922
00:46:31,536 --> 00:46:37,026 A:middle
So when you use Automator
to set up iOS devices,

923
00:46:37,436 --> 00:46:39,456 A:middle
you can create these
kind of workflows

924
00:46:39,456 --> 00:46:41,836 A:middle
that could be used
by anybody, even you.

925
00:46:42,116 --> 00:46:45,246 A:middle
They're convenient,
easily modifiable

926
00:46:45,246 --> 00:46:49,376 A:middle
because they're modular,
and they're used by anybody,

927
00:46:49,376 --> 00:46:51,496 A:middle
even your accidental
administrators.

928
00:46:51,756 --> 00:46:54,016 A:middle
And you can also then call

929
00:46:54,016 --> 00:46:56,996 A:middle
into the underlying library
structure using either

930
00:46:56,996 --> 00:46:58,876 A:middle
JavaScript or AppleScript

931
00:46:58,876 --> 00:47:02,246 A:middle
to make your own detailed
controllers as well.

932

933
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

934
00:46:58,876 --> 00:47:02,246 A:middle
to make your own detailed
controllers as well.

935
00:47:03,476 --> 00:47:06,516 A:middle
And that, all of this,
is documented for you

936
00:47:06,516 --> 00:47:10,576 A:middle
at a third website, called
configautomation.com.

937
00:47:11,436 --> 00:47:12,876 A:middle
It's available for you today.

938
00:47:13,756 --> 00:47:18,236 A:middle
So we looked at three different
examples today of how automation

939
00:47:18,236 --> 00:47:22,246 A:middle
and OS X can be used to
support the enterprise.

940
00:47:22,536 --> 00:47:26,256 A:middle
And especially important to
remember that the concept

941
00:47:26,256 --> 00:47:28,876 A:middle
of inclusion is really valuable.

942
00:47:29,316 --> 00:47:32,806 A:middle
When you have iOS and
OS X working together,

943
00:47:33,256 --> 00:47:34,566 A:middle
they're unbeatable.

944
00:47:34,966 --> 00:47:39,216 A:middle
When you have a variety of
work tools available to you,

945
00:47:39,406 --> 00:47:42,266 A:middle
you can create interesting
and powerful solutions.

946
00:47:42,876 --> 00:47:46,776 A:middle
And remember we have these links
here for you to get information

947
00:47:46,776 --> 00:47:49,426 A:middle
about all of the examples
that I showed you today.

948
00:47:49,586 --> 00:47:53,546 A:middle
We have photosautomation.com,
configautomation.com,

949
00:47:53,936 --> 00:47:56,626 A:middle
iworkautomation.com,
and for OS X

950
00:47:56,626 --> 00:48:00,336 A:middle
in general we have
macosxautomation.com as well.

951

952
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

953
00:47:56,626 --> 00:48:00,336 A:middle
in general we have
macosxautomation.com as well.

954
00:48:01,226 --> 00:48:05,316 A:middle
So I want to remind you that
if you want more detailed

955
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:08,076 A:middle
information about
Apple Configurator 2,

956
00:48:08,326 --> 00:48:12,256 A:middle
Todd on Tuesday really
covered it well in his session,

957
00:48:12,486 --> 00:48:14,916 A:middle
and I urge you to go back
and look at the video

958
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:16,896 A:middle
on that, on his session.

959
00:48:17,326 --> 00:48:20,076 A:middle
In addition, we have some
labs that are going on today

960
00:48:20,076 --> 00:48:23,526 A:middle
and tomorrow, and after I'm done
here I'm going to go downstairs

961
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:26,336 A:middle
and hang out at the lab so
you can come by and see me

962
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:28,976 A:middle
and ask any questions
about this and we can play

963
00:48:28,976 --> 00:48:30,796 A:middle
with it right there
and try these out.

964
00:48:31,736 --> 00:48:34,576 A:middle
So I want to thank you for
coming by today and thank you

965
00:48:34,576 --> 00:48:37,676 A:middle
so much for being part of
this experience for me.

966
00:48:37,966 --> 00:48:39,986 A:middle
I hope this was valuable
for you.

967
00:48:40,096 --> 00:48:40,536 A:middle
Thank you.

968
00:48:42,516 --> 00:48:56,110 A:middle
[ Applause ]
