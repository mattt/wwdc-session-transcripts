00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:24,111 A:middle
[Applause]

2
00:00:24,206 --> 00:00:25,546 A:middle
>> PAUL TURNER: Thank you.

3
00:00:25,946 --> 00:00:26,636 A:middle
Thank you, everyone.

4
00:00:26,636 --> 00:00:27,646 A:middle
Thanks for joining us here.

5
00:00:28,256 --> 00:00:29,906 A:middle
Thank you for joining
us for session 304.

6
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:33,096 A:middle
Welcome. My name is
Paul Turner and I'm one

7
00:00:33,096 --> 00:00:35,706 A:middle
of the engineering managers
for iTunes, but I also --

8
00:00:35,706 --> 00:00:37,266 A:middle
some of the teams that I lead,

9
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:38,946 A:middle
one of the teams is
the best teams at Apple

10
00:00:38,946 --> 00:00:41,226 A:middle
and that's the team that
manages the logistics

11
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:44,106 A:middle
and release control for
all of Apple's own apps.

12
00:00:44,426 --> 00:00:46,466 A:middle
And we use iTunes Connect,
just like you guys.

13
00:00:47,126 --> 00:00:50,226 A:middle
So this is a new session
we're trying out this year,

14
00:00:50,226 --> 00:00:52,606 A:middle
this is iTunes Connect
Development and Distribution.

15
00:00:53,146 --> 00:00:55,756 A:middle
We already have the
wildly popular what's new

16
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:56,456 A:middle
on iTunes Connect.

17
00:00:57,276 --> 00:01:01,466 A:middle
We just devoted an incredible
session to app analytics

18

19
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

20
00:00:57,276 --> 00:01:01,466 A:middle
We just devoted an incredible
session to app analytics

21
00:01:01,466 --> 00:01:03,516 A:middle
and maybe some of the
fundamental features

22
00:01:03,516 --> 00:01:05,966 A:middle
of iTunes Connect to make
sure that you are empowered

23
00:01:06,406 --> 00:01:07,356 A:middle
to make best use out of them.

24
00:01:07,716 --> 00:01:08,486 A:middle
That's what this is.

25
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:11,526 A:middle
From the conversations
that I had in the labs,

26
00:01:11,526 --> 00:01:13,086 A:middle
I think we picked
the right topics.

27
00:01:13,086 --> 00:01:15,786 A:middle
Let's jump into them.

28
00:01:15,816 --> 00:01:18,386 A:middle
We will talk about
the help and resources

29
00:01:18,386 --> 00:01:19,376 A:middle
that are available for you guys.

30
00:01:19,736 --> 00:01:21,826 A:middle
I want to talk about
the vast resources

31
00:01:21,826 --> 00:01:24,646 A:middle
that are available very
quickly but then we will jump

32
00:01:24,646 --> 00:01:26,636 A:middle
into a demo of TestFlight.

33
00:01:28,316 --> 00:01:30,796 A:middle
Then we will briefly go
over some of the materials

34
00:01:30,796 --> 00:01:32,706 A:middle
that you need to launch
your app on the App Store

35
00:01:34,046 --> 00:01:38,366 A:middle
which will lead us into a deep
dive of transporter and XML

36
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:39,856 A:middle
and how you manage them.

37
00:01:40,696 --> 00:01:42,476 A:middle
Sound good?

38
00:01:43,606 --> 00:01:44,456 A:middle
Sounds good, all right!

39
00:01:44,456 --> 00:01:47,666 A:middle
It's an interactive
presentation.

40
00:01:47,716 --> 00:01:48,396 A:middle
Stay with me here.

41
00:01:48,396 --> 00:01:48,716 A:middle
All right.

42
00:01:49,246 --> 00:01:50,226 A:middle
Let's jump in.

43
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:52,416 A:middle
This screen should be
available to everyone,

44
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,306 A:middle
this is iTunes Connect,

45
00:01:53,306 --> 00:01:56,646 A:middle
and here's all the
beautiful modules on this.

46
00:01:57,226 --> 00:01:59,176 A:middle
This is my favorite module.

47
00:01:59,176 --> 00:02:00,056 A:middle
My favorite module.

48

49
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

50
00:01:59,176 --> 00:02:00,056 A:middle
My favorite module.

51
00:02:00,526 --> 00:02:02,206 A:middle
This is My Apps.

52
00:02:02,546 --> 00:02:04,176 A:middle
This is where you spend a
lot of your time, the bread

53
00:02:04,176 --> 00:02:05,776 A:middle
and butter of iTunes Connect.

54
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:07,186 A:middle
This is where you
manage your apps

55
00:02:07,186 --> 00:02:09,416 A:middle
and manage your TestFlight
campaigns, manage versions

56
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,646 A:middle
and manage your pricing
and availability.

57
00:02:12,206 --> 00:02:13,916 A:middle
My Apps, if this was
a physical button,

58
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,386 A:middle
I feel like mine would
have the paint worn off,

59
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:20,386 A:middle
because I'm always in there.

60
00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:21,606 A:middle
This is our baby.

61
00:02:21,736 --> 00:02:23,316 A:middle
Our baby's name is
App Analytics.

62
00:02:23,786 --> 00:02:25,616 A:middle
It launched this year.

63
00:02:26,806 --> 00:02:28,146 A:middle
It's really empowering you guys.

64
00:02:28,146 --> 00:02:30,656 A:middle
It's giving you data, I think
that only we can provide

65
00:02:30,996 --> 00:02:34,176 A:middle
because of the integration, and
it's really giving you a picture

66
00:02:34,296 --> 00:02:37,666 A:middle
of how your app exists in your
customer's hands and we do

67
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:38,376 A:middle
that all the while

68
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:40,196 A:middle
by maintaining your
customer's privacy.

69
00:02:40,696 --> 00:02:41,976 A:middle
So we love App Analytics.

70
00:02:41,976 --> 00:02:43,246 A:middle
I hope you caught
the session earlier.

71
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,806 A:middle
It's amazing and as you can see,

72
00:02:45,016 --> 00:02:47,066 A:middle
we took the beta
badge off of it.

73
00:02:47,526 --> 00:02:51,116 A:middle
One more module I would like to
talk about, this is my protip

74
00:02:51,116 --> 00:02:52,546 A:middle
of the day and it's
not that big of a tip.

75
00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:55,336 A:middle
I already had a couple of
questions about it in the labs.

76
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:58,386 A:middle
And it's the agreements,
tax, and banking section

77
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:01,836 A:middle
and so this section -- my protip
is make sure you are caring

78

79
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

80
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:01,836 A:middle
and so this section -- my protip
is make sure you are caring

81
00:03:01,836 --> 00:03:04,046 A:middle
and feeding for your
iTunes Connect by going

82
00:03:04,046 --> 00:03:05,716 A:middle
into the agreements,
tax, and banking section

83
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:07,686 A:middle
and accepting your agreements.

84
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:10,436 A:middle
I think one went live on
Monday, the unified agreement.

85
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:12,886 A:middle
We had a couple of
questions in the lab.

86
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:15,926 A:middle
My protip is make sure you keep
your account up to date and go

87
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:17,156 A:middle
into your Agreements
and Tax and Banking.

88
00:03:17,236 --> 00:03:18,606 A:middle
It's a stellar tip.

89
00:03:19,056 --> 00:03:22,276 A:middle
Don't tell anyone.

90
00:03:22,426 --> 00:03:25,286 A:middle
This is Help and Resources,
resources and help.

91
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:26,966 A:middle
This is all new.

92
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:27,976 A:middle
We are revamping it.

93
00:03:28,146 --> 00:03:31,296 A:middle
We put as much design as the UI
designers let us put in there,

94
00:03:31,716 --> 00:03:33,266 A:middle
I don't know if you
caught the session earlier,

95
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:35,596 A:middle
but we are putting it
outside the log-in screen.

96
00:03:35,976 --> 00:03:39,226 A:middle
It's fully searchable
and it will be great.

97
00:03:39,406 --> 00:03:42,646 A:middle
Help and resources.

98
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:45,976 A:middle
Like I said,

99
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,966 A:middle
it's outside the log-in and
it contains the best piece

100
00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:52,896 A:middle
of information you will ever own
and that is the developer guide.

101
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,586 A:middle
This has everything
you need in it!

102
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:57,406 A:middle
This tells you how to
launch apps and how

103
00:03:57,406 --> 00:04:00,686 A:middle
to get your assets ready and how
to interact with iTunes Connect.

104

105
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

106
00:03:57,406 --> 00:04:00,686 A:middle
to get your assets ready and how
to interact with iTunes Connect.

107
00:04:00,686 --> 00:04:02,186 A:middle
Print it out, put it
under your pillow,

108
00:04:02,186 --> 00:04:03,196 A:middle
sleep with it, do
whatever you want.

109
00:04:03,196 --> 00:04:07,036 A:middle
The developer's guide is the
be-all and end-all document

110
00:04:07,036 --> 00:04:09,196 A:middle
and I hope you are reading
it and referencing it.

111
00:04:09,196 --> 00:04:10,736 A:middle
It has a lot more stuff.

112
00:04:10,736 --> 00:04:12,776 A:middle
It's 2015!

113
00:04:12,776 --> 00:04:14,056 A:middle
We have multimedia now.

114
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:16,216 A:middle
We have some videos in there.

115
00:04:16,796 --> 00:04:18,146 A:middle
We have some deep dive videos.

116
00:04:18,146 --> 00:04:21,116 A:middle
A lot of you guys
have questions.

117
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:22,036 A:middle
We read through the questions

118
00:04:22,356 --> 00:04:24,506 A:middle
and so we are making videos
constantly trying to to keep you

119
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:27,556 A:middle
up to date, we have Agreements,
Tax, and Banking, TestFlight,

120
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:31,546 A:middle
App Previews, App
Transfer, there as a video.

121
00:04:31,546 --> 00:04:32,746 A:middle
A lot of videos.

122
00:04:32,746 --> 00:04:33,916 A:middle
Check out these resources.

123
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:34,936 A:middle
They are meant to help you.

124
00:04:35,906 --> 00:04:36,856 A:middle
Of course we have
the developer guide

125
00:04:36,856 --> 00:04:38,546 A:middle
but we have specialized
user guides,

126
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:41,096 A:middle
one of which we will talk
about later in the session,

127
00:04:41,096 --> 00:04:42,896 A:middle
as the transporter user guides.

128
00:04:43,106 --> 00:04:45,366 A:middle
Deeper topics a lot of
specialized materials

129
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:48,476 A:middle
and then last but definitely
not least, the FAQs.

130
00:04:48,476 --> 00:04:51,206 A:middle
We have this incredible
operations team that's

131
00:04:51,286 --> 00:04:53,586 A:middle
constantly going through
all the support requests,

132
00:04:54,356 --> 00:04:56,766 A:middle
all the developer posts,
anything, and everything,

133
00:04:56,766 --> 00:04:59,496 A:middle
trying to come up with
relevant FAQs for you guys.

134
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:01,336 A:middle
It's likely that if
you have a question,

135

136
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

137
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:01,336 A:middle
It's likely that if
you have a question,

138
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:02,766 A:middle
it's answerable in the FAQs.

139
00:05:03,406 --> 00:05:04,836 A:middle
So that's resources and help.

140
00:05:05,126 --> 00:05:06,456 A:middle
I'm just going to move on here.

141
00:05:07,076 --> 00:05:09,806 A:middle
New also this year we have
iTunes Connect specific

142
00:05:09,806 --> 00:05:10,676 A:middle
developer forums.

143
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:11,786 A:middle
I hope you are using them.

144
00:05:11,786 --> 00:05:14,296 A:middle
We have an incredible community
of developers out there,

145
00:05:14,296 --> 00:05:16,976 A:middle
which is you guys and
thousands of others

146
00:05:17,476 --> 00:05:20,346 A:middle
and if you have a question,
there's probably a place --

147
00:05:20,846 --> 00:05:23,046 A:middle
somebody else probably
had the same question.

148
00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:25,166 A:middle
It's self-help, questions
and answers.

149
00:05:25,446 --> 00:05:26,986 A:middle
It's a forum post,
that's moderated

150
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:28,926 A:middle
and it's a fantastic
resource for you guys.

151
00:05:29,006 --> 00:05:31,506 A:middle
We would love to hear
your feedback on it.

152
00:05:31,846 --> 00:05:33,066 A:middle
We think it's doing
really great.

153
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:37,186 A:middle
It's questions and answers
and support and it's not

154
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:38,696 A:middle
for proprietary information
there.

155
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:41,766 A:middle
Don't pass any passwords to your
accounts and things in there.

156
00:05:42,236 --> 00:05:43,926 A:middle
I will put up the
URL right here.

157
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:47,606 A:middle
Quickly moving on to another
support resource that's

158
00:05:47,606 --> 00:05:50,456 A:middle
available, yes, AppleCare,
our friends at AppleCare.

159
00:05:50,456 --> 00:05:54,406 A:middle
We have iTunes Connect technical
support, via AppleCare.

160
00:05:54,406 --> 00:05:56,036 A:middle
If you go into help and
resources right now,

161
00:05:56,036 --> 00:05:58,366 A:middle
it's up in the top left
corner, it's called contact us,

162
00:05:58,846 --> 00:06:00,916 A:middle
and you can reach it via
the developer forums.

163

164
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

165
00:05:58,846 --> 00:06:00,916 A:middle
and you can reach it via
the developer forums.

166
00:06:01,806 --> 00:06:06,986 A:middle
Then we can filter it down by,
I think 19 different categories.

167
00:06:06,986 --> 00:06:09,126 A:middle
We can get your issue
to the right specialist.

168
00:06:09,426 --> 00:06:12,216 A:middle
Sometimes you have a problem
with your account and you want

169
00:06:12,216 --> 00:06:14,176 A:middle
to ask somebody a question.

170
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:15,166 A:middle
Go for it.

171
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,386 A:middle
Ask us. It's there for you.

172
00:06:17,046 --> 00:06:18,836 A:middle
I have a little bit
of a surprise,

173
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,576 A:middle
although I think it's
already out this in the wild,

174
00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:22,486 A:middle
but we have an 800-number now.

175
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:23,746 A:middle
You can call us.

176
00:06:23,746 --> 00:06:26,376 A:middle
If you have questions that you
really need to somebody about,

177
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:29,616 A:middle
the account, you can call
us on an 8-hundred number.

178
00:06:29,616 --> 00:06:31,846 A:middle
It rings to phone in my pocket.

179
00:06:31,846 --> 00:06:32,256 A:middle
No, I'm kidding.

180
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:35,356 A:middle
Oh, it -- somebody is actually
calling -- there you go.

181
00:06:35,806 --> 00:06:37,616 A:middle
I will put that number
up right now.

182
00:06:38,486 --> 00:06:41,416 A:middle
You guys can write it down
or take a picture of it.

183
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,876 A:middle
That's the iTunes
Connect technical support.

184
00:06:43,876 --> 00:06:45,256 A:middle
Nobody hummed.

185
00:06:45,386 --> 00:06:48,916 A:middle
Too bad. 1-800-633-2152.

186
00:06:49,516 --> 00:06:54,546 A:middle
[Laughter]

187
00:06:55,046 --> 00:06:55,976 A:middle
I had a bet with people
that I wouldn't sing.

188
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:57,026 A:middle
There you go.

189
00:06:57,026 --> 00:07:01,236 A:middle
All right.

190

191
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

192
00:06:57,026 --> 00:07:01,236 A:middle
All right.

193
00:07:01,236 --> 00:07:03,006 A:middle
I know you want to see
TestFlight and XML.

194
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,296 A:middle
Here we go.

195
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:08,386 A:middle
There's a couple
of other resources,

196
00:07:08,446 --> 00:07:11,286 A:middle
developer technical support.

197
00:07:11,286 --> 00:07:13,306 A:middle
Sometimes you read
the documentation,

198
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:15,516 A:middle
and you have asked the
questions in the dev forums

199
00:07:15,516 --> 00:07:17,066 A:middle
and maybe you have
interacted with AppleCare

200
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:19,076 A:middle
but maybe it's more of a
deeper engineering question.

201
00:07:19,456 --> 00:07:21,676 A:middle
Developer technical support
is always available to you.

202
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:25,126 A:middle
Go and check it out and
also I really encourage you

203
00:07:25,126 --> 00:07:26,706 A:middle
to join our bug filing
community.

204
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:29,296 A:middle
We really appreciate the
bugs that you guys file.

205
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:31,716 A:middle
We read them and
prioritize them and fix them.

206
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:33,996 A:middle
It's a great relationship
that we have with you

207
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:34,796 A:middle
and I really appreciate it.

208
00:07:34,796 --> 00:07:36,056 A:middle
So join the community.

209
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:41,086 A:middle
Lastly, I just want to reinforce
that there's some great articles

210
00:07:41,316 --> 00:07:44,546 A:middle
on the developer -- excuse
me, the developer section.

211
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:46,186 A:middle
Developer portal.

212
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,306 A:middle
This one, we talked about in
the new and iTunes Connect,

213
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:50,426 A:middle
but I will put it up here again.

214
00:07:50,426 --> 00:07:54,396 A:middle
The app review is giving you the
most common rejection reasons

215
00:07:54,396 --> 00:07:55,636 A:middle
for your app not making it

216
00:07:55,636 --> 00:07:58,526 A:middle
through the first pass
through app review.

217
00:07:58,526 --> 00:07:59,676 A:middle
They keep it up to date.

218
00:07:59,676 --> 00:08:00,396 A:middle
It's fantastic.

219

220
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

221
00:07:59,676 --> 00:08:00,396 A:middle
It's fantastic.

222
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,486 A:middle
There are a couple of others.

223
00:08:02,386 --> 00:08:06,636 A:middle
There's a marketing video that's
available as well or excuse me,

224
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:08,446 A:middle
a marketing article,
that's available as well.

225
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,776 A:middle
It shows you how to make your
product page look its best.

226
00:08:11,096 --> 00:08:11,606 A:middle
Check it out.

227
00:08:11,606 --> 00:08:12,696 A:middle
These are great articles.

228
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,596 A:middle
There's another one
on app previews.

229
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:16,086 A:middle
All right.

230
00:08:16,616 --> 00:08:18,776 A:middle
So that's the help
and resources section.

231
00:08:18,776 --> 00:08:20,266 A:middle
I wanted to reinforce
those things and make sure

232
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,026 A:middle
that you were empowered.

233
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:24,576 A:middle
So, what do you do when you have
an app that's about ready to go?

234
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:25,436 A:middle
You test it.

235
00:08:25,436 --> 00:08:26,586 A:middle
And what do you test it with?

236
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:27,576 A:middle
You test it with TestFlight.

237
00:08:27,576 --> 00:08:30,826 A:middle
I would like to bring up my
good friend, Alex Miyamura

238
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:33,586 A:middle
to give you a demo
of TestFlight.

239
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,885 A:middle
[Applause]

240
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:38,716 A:middle
>> ALEX MIYAMURA: Thank
you so much, Paul.

241
00:08:39,756 --> 00:08:40,486 A:middle
I'm Alex Miyamura.

242
00:08:40,765 --> 00:08:43,166 A:middle
I'm an engineer with the
TestFlight team I'm here

243
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,736 A:middle
to show you how easy it is

244
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:47,036 A:middle
to distribute your
app via TestFlight.

245
00:08:47,576 --> 00:08:51,676 A:middle
Now, we will begin with a
screen that is very familiar to,

246
00:08:51,676 --> 00:08:54,536 A:middle
I'm pretty sure everyone
in this room right now,

247
00:08:54,536 --> 00:08:55,486 A:middle
and this is Xcode.

248
00:08:55,816 --> 00:08:58,886 A:middle
I have an app that I
created open, Touch Fighter

249
00:08:58,926 --> 00:09:02,086 A:middle
and I'm going to upload
it up to iTunes Connect.

250

251
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

252
00:08:58,926 --> 00:09:02,086 A:middle
and I'm going to upload
it up to iTunes Connect.

253
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:07,386 A:middle
Now, in order to do that, I will
go up to product, and archive.

254
00:09:07,706 --> 00:09:10,956 A:middle
And one of the great things
about TestFlight is that instead

255
00:09:10,956 --> 00:09:12,976 A:middle
of having to upload
one beta build

256
00:09:12,976 --> 00:09:15,676 A:middle
and then also an App Store
build, if you find a beta build

257
00:09:15,676 --> 00:09:19,306 A:middle
that works for you and
you want to distribute

258
00:09:19,986 --> 00:09:26,056 A:middle
that to the App Store, you
don't have to do that again.

259
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:31,166 A:middle
I can go ahead and click this
big button, submit to App Store.

260
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,536 A:middle
Usually you would go
through the prompt

261
00:09:33,536 --> 00:09:35,806 A:middle
and would you deliver your
build to the App Store

262
00:09:35,806 --> 00:09:38,356 A:middle
but in the interest of time,
I'm actually going to switch

263
00:09:38,406 --> 00:09:42,186 A:middle
over to iTunes Connect, where I
have a build that's already been

264
00:09:42,926 --> 00:09:48,636 A:middle
-- a build that's already been
uploaded to iTunes Connect.

265
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:50,316 A:middle
And here we go.

266
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:52,486 A:middle
Thank you so much.

267
00:09:53,516 --> 00:09:55,856 A:middle
[Applause]

268
00:09:56,356 --> 00:09:58,836 A:middle
>> ALEX MIYAMURA: And so now
you will see the My Apps module

269
00:09:58,836 --> 00:10:01,376 A:middle
that Paul spoke about,
and we'll click in there

270

271
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

272
00:09:58,836 --> 00:10:01,376 A:middle
that Paul spoke about,
and we'll click in there

273
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:03,866 A:middle
and see TouchFighter
is right in there.

274
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:05,406 A:middle
We will click in there.

275
00:10:05,956 --> 00:10:07,556 A:middle
And you will see
the prerelease tab.

276
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:10,496 A:middle
Now, of course, we are
TestFlighting these apps.

277
00:10:10,596 --> 00:10:12,406 A:middle
So we do care about prerelease

278
00:10:12,406 --> 00:10:14,256 A:middle
and we will go straight
into there.

279
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:19,576 A:middle
And you will see we have
build two of version 1.0

280
00:10:20,076 --> 00:10:23,776 A:middle
and we actually get a lot of
questions from developers as to

281
00:10:23,776 --> 00:10:25,946 A:middle
where that comes from, right?

282
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:28,136 A:middle
And I will actually
show you right now.

283
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:30,516 A:middle
So we will go back to Xcode.

284
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:36,136 A:middle
And we are in the
info.plist file for my app.

285
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:40,156 A:middle
I will zoom in so everyone
can see and as you can see,

286
00:10:40,226 --> 00:10:43,276 A:middle
the bundle version
short string is 1.0.

287
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:46,026 A:middle
That matches 1.0 that we
saw in iTunes Connect.

288
00:10:46,656 --> 00:10:48,656 A:middle
And the bundle version is 2,

289
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:51,916 A:middle
which matches the build
number build number 2.

290
00:10:52,676 --> 00:10:55,706 A:middle
And test flight has
two types of testing.

291
00:10:56,206 --> 00:10:58,866 A:middle
We have internal testing
and external testing.

292
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,866 A:middle
And first, we'll go
over internal testing.

293

294
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

295
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,866 A:middle
And first, we'll go
over internal testing.

296
00:11:01,366 --> 00:11:04,256 A:middle
Internal testing is used
to distribute your app

297
00:11:04,256 --> 00:11:06,686 A:middle
to a small select
group of testers,

298
00:11:07,406 --> 00:11:09,656 A:middle
within your iTunes
Connect organization.

299
00:11:09,956 --> 00:11:13,896 A:middle
These testers must be either an
admin role or a technical role

300
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:15,676 A:middle
and you get 25 of them.

301
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:19,586 A:middle
Each build that you distribute
is currently available

302
00:11:19,586 --> 00:11:22,306 A:middle
for 30 days, but
coming this fall,

303
00:11:22,486 --> 00:11:23,616 A:middle
we're actually going
to double that.

304
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,726 A:middle
It will be available
for 60 days.

305
00:11:26,516 --> 00:11:29,116 A:middle
[Applause]

306
00:11:29,616 --> 00:11:31,736 A:middle
And so we will go
ahead and click

307
00:11:31,736 --> 00:11:33,496 A:middle
into the internal testers tab.

308
00:11:34,106 --> 00:11:36,386 A:middle
And you will see that
I'm here, Alex Miyamura,

309
00:11:36,776 --> 00:11:38,216 A:middle
and I want to invite one

310
00:11:38,216 --> 00:11:41,466 A:middle
of my colleagues Johnny
Appleseed to be a tester.

311
00:11:41,466 --> 00:11:43,316 A:middle
Oh, here's Johnny Appleseed.

312
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:50,646 A:middle
He's a technical user and so
we can invite him as a tester.

313
00:11:50,926 --> 00:11:56,956 A:middle
And we will go to
TestFlight beta testers

314
00:11:57,396 --> 00:12:00,576 A:middle
and select his Apple
ID and hit save.

315

316
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

317
00:11:57,396 --> 00:12:00,576 A:middle
and select his Apple
ID and hit save.

318
00:12:01,056 --> 00:12:04,976 A:middle
When we have done that, that
actually adds my colleague,

319
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:07,986 A:middle
Johnny Appleseed as a
tester and if we go back

320
00:12:07,986 --> 00:12:09,296 A:middle
to the internal testers tab,

321
00:12:09,716 --> 00:12:12,576 A:middle
you can see that Johnny
Appleseed is now a tester

322
00:12:12,576 --> 00:12:12,996 A:middle
for this app.

323
00:12:13,926 --> 00:12:20,636 A:middle
Now for them to install
the app on their iOS device

324
00:12:20,636 --> 00:12:24,196 A:middle
on the TestFlight app, they
will check all the testers

325
00:12:24,196 --> 00:12:25,036 A:middle
that they want to invite.

326
00:12:26,486 --> 00:12:27,866 A:middle
Go to save.

327
00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:32,916 A:middle
And then go back to
builds and you will see

328
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:36,736 A:middle
that we have a switch for
TestFlight beta testing.

329
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:39,406 A:middle
We will go ahead and
toggle that switch

330
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:43,466 A:middle
and that will send those invite
emails to all the testers

331
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:44,156 A:middle
that you have selected.

332
00:12:44,486 --> 00:12:47,526 A:middle
As you can see, the build
is active for 30 days now.

333
00:12:48,996 --> 00:12:57,476 A:middle
And so once you -- once
you switched that switch,

334
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:01,166 A:middle
you will see that I as a
tester have received an email

335

336
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

337
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:01,166 A:middle
you will see that I as a
tester have received an email

338
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:06,926 A:middle
from the iTunes Store, and I'm
invited to test TouchFighter

339
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:14,606 A:middle
and I can go ahead and open that
in TestFlight, and tap install.

340
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:17,776 A:middle
Now we will see that
the app installs.

341
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:19,646 A:middle
It's ready to open.

342
00:13:19,646 --> 00:13:20,956 A:middle
You go back to your home screen

343
00:13:20,956 --> 00:13:23,366 A:middle
and then you will see
TouchFighter right there next

344
00:13:23,366 --> 00:13:26,176 A:middle
to the TestFlight app
and that orange dot next

345
00:13:26,176 --> 00:13:28,806 A:middle
to TouchFighter indicates
it's a TestFlight app,

346
00:13:28,806 --> 00:13:31,006 A:middle
that it's a beta app.

347
00:13:31,296 --> 00:13:34,746 A:middle
And so once your testers
are able to test your app,

348
00:13:34,926 --> 00:13:36,546 A:middle
they will give you feedback

349
00:13:36,546 --> 00:13:37,976 A:middle
and you will be able
to iterate on that.

350
00:13:38,406 --> 00:13:41,646 A:middle
You will want to distribute your
app to a wider range of testers

351
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,946 A:middle
and for that, we have
external testers.

352
00:13:46,646 --> 00:13:49,236 A:middle
And so we'll go into the
external testers' tab

353
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,496 A:middle
and the first thing that
you will see is, wow!

354
00:13:52,356 --> 00:13:57,046 A:middle
You have 1,000 of these as
compared to 25 internal testers.

355
00:13:57,386 --> 00:13:59,976 A:middle
That's 40 times and
coming this fall,

356

357
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

358
00:14:00,046 --> 00:14:01,136 A:middle
again, we will double that.

359
00:14:01,616 --> 00:14:03,256 A:middle
Instead of 1,000,
you will be able

360
00:14:03,256 --> 00:14:05,326 A:middle
to have 2,000 external testers.

361
00:14:06,516 --> 00:14:09,826 A:middle
[Applause]

362
00:14:10,326 --> 00:14:14,386 A:middle
So in order to add testers to be
external testers for your build,

363
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:18,326 A:middle
you will click on the plus,
and you will add new testers.

364
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:20,996 A:middle
You can obviously
type in the email.

365
00:14:26,396 --> 00:14:28,706 A:middle
But this can get really tedious

366
00:14:28,706 --> 00:14:31,476 A:middle
if you have 1,000
names to type in there.

367
00:14:31,476 --> 00:14:32,986 A:middle
You will be there for
a long, long time.

368
00:14:33,756 --> 00:14:36,816 A:middle
So that's why we have added
this option to import a file.

369
00:14:37,326 --> 00:14:41,206 A:middle
Now, we provide you with the
CSV template if you click

370
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:45,016 A:middle
on the question mark next
to import file, but in order

371
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:48,086 A:middle
to actually import
those testers,

372
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:49,876 A:middle
you will click open import file,

373
00:14:50,696 --> 00:14:53,346 A:middle
and it will actually
populate all the tester names

374
00:14:53,656 --> 00:14:58,306 A:middle
and you will be able
to add the testers.

375
00:14:59,556 --> 00:15:03,076 A:middle
The one difference, other than
the large amount of testers

376

377
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

378
00:14:59,556 --> 00:15:03,076 A:middle
The one difference, other than
the large amount of testers

379
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:05,016 A:middle
that you get as external
testing,

380
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:07,826 A:middle
versus internal testing is
that for external testing,

381
00:15:07,826 --> 00:15:10,426 A:middle
do you have to submit your
app for beta app review.

382
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:13,996 A:middle
We will go ahead and do that.

383
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,556 A:middle
You have to fill in
some information.

384
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:17,646 A:middle
Obviously, you need to tell
your testers what to test.

385
00:15:17,646 --> 00:15:20,276 A:middle
They need to see what
features you really want

386
00:15:20,276 --> 00:15:22,346 A:middle
to have them focus on.

387
00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:23,646 A:middle
You might be adding
something new

388
00:15:23,646 --> 00:15:28,706 A:middle
and you really want them
to drill down in it.

389
00:15:28,966 --> 00:15:31,866 A:middle
Feedback email is very important
because the whole point

390
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:33,426 A:middle
of testing is to be
able to get feedback

391
00:15:33,426 --> 00:15:35,426 A:middle
and to be able to
improve your app.

392
00:15:35,426 --> 00:15:37,286 A:middle
So we do require that.

393
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:42,756 A:middle
Privacy policy is something
that you add as well

394
00:15:42,756 --> 00:15:44,356 A:middle
and then your app description.

395
00:15:44,356 --> 00:15:51,086 A:middle
"This is the best app ever."

396
00:15:51,276 --> 00:15:54,136 A:middle
And we also require some
contact information,

397
00:15:54,136 --> 00:15:57,906 A:middle
so that if there is a problem
with your app, we will be able

398
00:15:57,906 --> 00:15:59,546 A:middle
to reach out to you, and so

399
00:15:59,546 --> 00:16:02,006 A:middle
that that can be get
resolved as soon as possible.

400

401
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

402
00:15:59,546 --> 00:16:02,006 A:middle
that that can be get
resolved as soon as possible.

403
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:04,006 A:middle
And once you fill

404
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:06,416 A:middle
that information in,
you can click next.

405
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:08,926 A:middle
And export compliance.

406
00:16:09,396 --> 00:16:15,056 A:middle
We have some export
labs here at WWDC.

407
00:16:15,056 --> 00:16:16,866 A:middle
This is a fairly simple app

408
00:16:17,146 --> 00:16:19,716 A:middle
and so we will go
ahead and click no.

409
00:16:20,456 --> 00:16:21,246 A:middle
We will submit.

410
00:16:22,746 --> 00:16:27,036 A:middle
And now you will see
that external testing

411
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:28,776 A:middle
for build 2 is waiting
for review.

412
00:16:28,776 --> 00:16:30,386 A:middle
Obviously you can
remove it from review

413
00:16:30,816 --> 00:16:33,366 A:middle
and once your app
passes beta app review,

414
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,386 A:middle
iTunes Connect will
send you an email

415
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:40,456 A:middle
and then you can send invites
to all of your external testers.

416
00:16:40,856 --> 00:16:42,376 A:middle
And now back to Paul.

417
00:16:43,516 --> 00:16:47,366 A:middle
[Applause]

418
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:49,316 A:middle
>> PAUL TURNER: Alex
what was it,

419
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:52,586 A:middle
the best feature is
the one you don't have?

420
00:16:52,586 --> 00:16:52,653 A:middle
>> ALEX MIYAMURA:

421
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:56,356 A:middle
No provisioning profiles
and no UUIDs.

422
00:16:56,356 --> 00:16:58,966 A:middle
>> PAUL TURNER: I will
make T-shirts that say that

423
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:03,096 A:middle
and we're going to wear them
around town and everyone's going

424

425
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

426
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:03,096 A:middle
and we're going to wear them
around town and everyone's going

427
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:06,636 A:middle
to think we are the
weirdest people ever.

428
00:17:06,636 --> 00:17:11,205 A:middle
Before I bring up Mr. Nik Uglov
to do a deep dive into XML,

429
00:17:11,205 --> 00:17:14,566 A:middle
I just want to remind everybody
of all the materials needed

430
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:15,796 A:middle
to launch an app
on the App Store.

431
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:21,536 A:middle
We come to the end and we are
about to release and we go, oh,

432
00:17:21,536 --> 00:17:22,586 A:middle
my gosh, I have to get all

433
00:17:22,586 --> 00:17:25,996 A:middle
of those screen shots
localized or the privacy URL.

434
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:27,986 A:middle
So let's take a look at
the store real quick.

435
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,176 A:middle
App icons.

436
00:17:30,506 --> 00:17:33,566 A:middle
One for the app, one
for the watch app,

437
00:17:34,726 --> 00:17:37,506 A:middle
hopefully you guys are
doing an app preview.

438
00:17:37,506 --> 00:17:40,066 A:middle
We also have five
screen shots per device.

439
00:17:40,566 --> 00:17:42,116 A:middle
Just refreshing this
in your head right now.

440
00:17:42,116 --> 00:17:44,556 A:middle
Of course, now we take
Apple Watch screen shots.

441
00:17:45,326 --> 00:17:49,196 A:middle
Starting counting how
many screen shots.

442
00:17:49,196 --> 00:17:51,826 A:middle
Five per device and
28 localizations.

443
00:17:52,486 --> 00:17:53,796 A:middle
We have app descriptions.

444
00:17:53,796 --> 00:17:56,146 A:middle
We want to draw people
into your app

445
00:17:56,146 --> 00:17:57,156 A:middle
and make sure they
understand how

446
00:17:57,156 --> 00:17:58,216 A:middle
to use it before they buy it.

447
00:17:58,216 --> 00:18:02,716 A:middle
If it has a new version,
it's what's new text.

448

449
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

450
00:17:58,216 --> 00:18:02,716 A:middle
If it has a new version,
it's what's new text.

451
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:06,076 A:middle
And privacy policies and
especially if it's a kid's app

452
00:18:06,076 --> 00:18:08,306 A:middle
and EULAs and all
of these things

453
00:18:08,306 --> 00:18:10,336 A:middle
that you need to get together.

454
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:12,866 A:middle
I think that's 840
screen shots possible.

455
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:14,366 A:middle
We did the math there.

456
00:18:14,366 --> 00:18:15,156 A:middle
You know, fancy!

457
00:18:15,456 --> 00:18:18,786 A:middle
And we make it really easy on
iTunes Connect to get them in.

458
00:18:18,786 --> 00:18:20,826 A:middle
We have the drag and drop
wells that we reintroduced

459
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:24,066 A:middle
and separated the sections and
made it a really powerful tool.

460
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:26,586 A:middle
But maybe you have
more than one app.

461
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:29,446 A:middle
Maybe you are updating your
screen shots frequently.

462
00:18:29,766 --> 00:18:33,186 A:middle
Maybe you have lots of apps and
lots of designers making all

463
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:34,196 A:middle
of these screen shots for you.

464
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,616 A:middle
Make you have a CMS system.

465
00:18:35,676 --> 00:18:38,956 A:middle
Maybe you have a corporate CMS
system, wouldn't it be nice

466
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:42,676 A:middle
to hook up iTunes Connect to
your system and manage this

467
00:18:42,676 --> 00:18:44,026 A:middle
in an automated fashion.

468
00:18:44,026 --> 00:18:47,756 A:middle
And that's what we have to talk
about right now, Transporter

469
00:18:48,206 --> 00:18:49,306 A:middle
and command line automation.

470
00:18:49,306 --> 00:18:51,346 A:middle
Let's bring up my good
friend, Mr. Nik Uglov.

471
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:56,896 A:middle
[Applause]

472
00:18:57,396 --> 00:18:59,236 A:middle
>> NIK UGLOV: Hi, everybody
my name is Nik Uglov,

473
00:18:59,236 --> 00:19:02,996 A:middle
I'm an engineering manager with
iTunes Store for content import.

474

475
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

476
00:18:59,236 --> 00:19:02,996 A:middle
I'm an engineering manager with
iTunes Store for content import.

477
00:19:03,946 --> 00:19:08,206 A:middle
And as Paul just showed you
and kind of gave you a hint

478
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:12,086 A:middle
that there's quite a lot
of data for you to enter

479
00:19:12,086 --> 00:19:14,016 A:middle
into iTunes Connect in
order for your app to appeal

480
00:19:14,016 --> 00:19:15,986 A:middle
to the widest possible audience.

481
00:19:16,596 --> 00:19:19,356 A:middle
The store's localized
in 28 languages.

482
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:22,456 A:middle
So that's how many languages
you can localize the metadata

483
00:19:22,456 --> 00:19:23,406 A:middle
about your app for.

484
00:19:23,926 --> 00:19:26,666 A:middle
And it certainly
makes sense to reach

485
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,876 A:middle
out to your potential
customers in the language

486
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:29,776 A:middle
that they can understand.

487
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:36,186 A:middle
There's up to five screen
shots to set up for each

488
00:19:36,186 --> 00:19:38,446 A:middle
of the devices that
your app runs on,

489
00:19:38,936 --> 00:19:40,166 A:middle
and those are localizable.

490
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:43,636 A:middle
There rates and pricing
to set up.

491
00:19:45,056 --> 00:19:46,086 A:middle
In-app purchases.

492
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:48,006 A:middle
Some of you have a few of those.

493
00:19:48,636 --> 00:19:51,466 A:middle
Some have hundreds, and
some have had thousands.

494
00:19:51,466 --> 00:19:51,986 A:middle
We have seen that.

495
00:19:52,586 --> 00:19:55,216 A:middle
And those are localizable.

496
00:19:56,076 --> 00:19:57,726 A:middle
And those have screen
shots in their own right.

497
00:19:58,836 --> 00:20:00,136 A:middle
Game Center achievements

498

499
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

500
00:19:58,836 --> 00:20:00,136 A:middle
Game Center achievements

501
00:20:00,136 --> 00:20:03,946 A:middle
and leaderboards also have
images and localization.

502
00:20:03,946 --> 00:20:05,676 A:middle
Are you counting?

503
00:20:07,026 --> 00:20:10,206 A:middle
That's quite a lot
of work there.

504
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:12,186 A:middle
And for those of you who have
multiple apps on the store.

505
00:20:13,406 --> 00:20:15,236 A:middle
First of all, congratulations
and thank you.

506
00:20:16,156 --> 00:20:17,706 A:middle
But also that means that there's

507
00:20:17,706 --> 00:20:19,146 A:middle
that much more work
to do, right?

508
00:20:20,246 --> 00:20:21,966 A:middle
And really at that scale,

509
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:24,806 A:middle
no matter how good a UI we will
put together in iTunes Connect,

510
00:20:25,496 --> 00:20:27,456 A:middle
it's still going to get
tedious and error-prone

511
00:20:27,456 --> 00:20:28,786 A:middle
to copy and paste that data.

512
00:20:28,786 --> 00:20:33,246 A:middle
No matter what we do,
it will not scale.

513
00:20:34,206 --> 00:20:38,016 A:middle
So let's take a look at
doing it some other way.

514
00:20:38,016 --> 00:20:40,986 A:middle
I will produce a command
line tool called Transporter

515
00:20:41,466 --> 00:20:44,476 A:middle
that manages inactions
between your environment

516
00:20:44,566 --> 00:20:48,496 A:middle
and iTunes Connect using
an app metadata XML feed.

517
00:20:49,366 --> 00:20:51,506 A:middle
The feed covers the
areas I just named,

518
00:20:52,056 --> 00:20:55,826 A:middle
the version level localization,
the rates and pricing,

519
00:20:55,826 --> 00:20:59,566 A:middle
and in-app purchases and
Game Center achievements

520

521
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

522
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:02,266 A:middle
and leaderboards.

523
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:05,676 A:middle
It's not new functionality
we are introducing.

524
00:21:06,376 --> 00:21:09,576 A:middle
We want to make sure that you
are aware of it and using it

525
00:21:09,576 --> 00:21:11,066 A:middle
and for those of you who
are new to the program --

526
00:21:11,066 --> 00:21:12,706 A:middle
new developers, by
the way, welcome --

527
00:21:13,986 --> 00:21:16,796 A:middle
we want to make sure that
you know that you have it

528
00:21:16,796 --> 00:21:19,276 A:middle
in your hands and ready
to take advantage of it.

529
00:21:20,586 --> 00:21:23,296 A:middle
This is a fully supported
robust functionality used

530
00:21:23,296 --> 00:21:24,846 A:middle
by developers like
you every day.

531
00:21:25,556 --> 00:21:26,786 A:middle
It's great for automation.

532
00:21:27,466 --> 00:21:30,546 A:middle
You are able to manage
your data in bulk.

533
00:21:30,546 --> 00:21:34,296 A:middle
And more intriguingly
integrate iTunes Connect

534
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,306 A:middle
with your back-end systems
whatever those may be.

535
00:21:36,846 --> 00:21:43,596 A:middle
What I mean by that is suppose
we have already an asset

536
00:21:43,596 --> 00:21:46,006 A:middle
management system where the
screen shots are collected,

537
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:49,896 A:middle
or maybe your contracting out
with some company that allows

538
00:21:49,896 --> 00:21:51,206 A:middle
to you localize that metadata

539
00:21:51,206 --> 00:21:53,356 A:middle
because you don't have
the speakers of all

540
00:21:53,356 --> 00:21:54,536 A:middle
of those languages in house.

541
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:57,436 A:middle
So you take it back and you
need to park it somewhere.

542
00:21:57,436 --> 00:22:00,916 A:middle
You are holding it somewhere and
you have some sort of process

543

544
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

545
00:21:57,436 --> 00:22:00,916 A:middle
You are holding it somewhere and
you have some sort of process

546
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,416 A:middle
that works for your company.

547
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:05,166 A:middle
At that point, if you
have a system like this

548
00:22:05,606 --> 00:22:09,516 A:middle
or you are thinking of setting
it up, it becomes just a matter

549
00:22:09,516 --> 00:22:13,096 A:middle
of an XML export into a format
that we are about to see,

550
00:22:14,026 --> 00:22:19,446 A:middle
hook it up with Transporter and
put together a little harness

551
00:22:19,476 --> 00:22:21,776 A:middle
to capture any validation
messages we might send back

552
00:22:22,056 --> 00:22:23,106 A:middle
and you are on the
way to automate.

553
00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:26,836 A:middle
So a few basic rules.

554
00:22:27,986 --> 00:22:31,136 A:middle
The app itself, and the
version that you are trying

555
00:22:31,136 --> 00:22:33,296 A:middle
to target must already
exist in iTunes Connect.

556
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:36,636 A:middle
You set those up first
and you are ready to go.

557
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:39,646 A:middle
All of these state transitions
are done in iTunes Connect,

558
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:41,036 A:middle
like submitting your
app for review

559
00:22:41,036 --> 00:22:44,936 A:middle
or submitting in-app
purchases for review.

560
00:22:44,936 --> 00:22:48,226 A:middle
The app binaries are
uploaded the same way they are

561
00:22:48,226 --> 00:22:50,916 A:middle
through today, through
Xcode or application loader.

562
00:22:52,006 --> 00:22:52,606 A:middle
No change.

563
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,536 A:middle
And the feed itself is available

564
00:22:55,536 --> 00:22:57,606 A:middle
for iOS apps and
Mac apps equally.

565

566
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

567
00:23:01,516 --> 00:23:02,726 A:middle
So how does this work?

568
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,016 A:middle
First of all, it's a
two-way communication.

569
00:23:06,366 --> 00:23:08,216 A:middle
You use Transporter,
the command line tool,

570
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:11,876 A:middle
and the first thing I suggest
you do is do a metadata lookup.

571
00:23:12,576 --> 00:23:16,996 A:middle
What this does is it retrieves
onto your local environment,

572
00:23:17,766 --> 00:23:20,576 A:middle
the current state
of the app metadata

573
00:23:20,696 --> 00:23:22,046 A:middle
as we have it in iTunes Connect.

574
00:23:22,656 --> 00:23:24,866 A:middle
So you download it in
a form of a package

575
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:26,886 A:middle
which is just a fancy
word for a directory named

576
00:23:26,886 --> 00:23:29,086 A:middle
after your app SKU with
a .itmsp extension.

577
00:23:30,096 --> 00:23:31,126 A:middle
You crack one of those open

578
00:23:31,126 --> 00:23:33,636 A:middle
and you find a metadata
XML file in there.

579
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:36,996 A:middle
This is the expression of
all the metadata we have

580
00:23:36,996 --> 00:23:41,226 A:middle
for your app so far and this
is the file that you would use

581
00:23:41,226 --> 00:23:43,416 A:middle
to make changes to
iTunes Connect.

582
00:23:43,836 --> 00:23:47,096 A:middle
You edit that file and you
add some screen shots to it,

583
00:23:47,096 --> 00:23:48,546 A:middle
any other assets
that you need to add.

584
00:23:49,276 --> 00:23:52,256 A:middle
You validate it, to make sure
that it passes all the rules

585
00:23:52,456 --> 00:23:54,256 A:middle
and if its, go ahead and upload.

586
00:23:54,846 --> 00:23:58,066 A:middle
So this forms a life
cycle of your interactions

587
00:23:58,096 --> 00:24:00,296 A:middle
with iTunes Connect
using Transporter.

588

589
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

590
00:23:58,096 --> 00:24:00,296 A:middle
with iTunes Connect
using Transporter.

591
00:24:01,286 --> 00:24:06,736 A:middle
Download the package, edit XML
and add assets to it, validate,

592
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:09,956 A:middle
and upload and repeat
over time as necessary

593
00:24:09,956 --> 00:24:11,736 A:middle
to achieve the edits
you are trying to get.

594
00:24:12,226 --> 00:24:15,876 A:middle
Let's take a look
at the commands.

595
00:24:16,316 --> 00:24:18,166 A:middle
This is for the metadata lookup.

596
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,506 A:middle
This is to get the
information from us.

597
00:24:20,986 --> 00:24:25,626 A:middle
The command is iTMSTransporter
and the first method

598
00:24:25,626 --> 00:24:28,906 A:middle
or mode you want to explore
is the look up metadata.

599
00:24:30,156 --> 00:24:33,596 A:middle
Use your iTunes Connect user
name and you identify the app

600
00:24:33,756 --> 00:24:35,886 A:middle
that you are interested
in by the vendor ID.

601
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,246 A:middle
The vendor ID is your app's SKU.

602
00:24:38,246 --> 00:24:41,996 A:middle
Not the bundle ID, not the
Apple ID, that's the app SKU.

603
00:24:43,336 --> 00:24:47,866 A:middle
Give where you would like
this to be deposited in.

604
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:52,536 A:middle
You will get the
metadata XML data inside

605
00:24:53,746 --> 00:24:58,206 A:middle
and the reason I recommend
that you start this way is

606
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:01,006 A:middle
that it's a lot easier
to start by example.

607

608
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

609
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:01,006 A:middle
that it's a lot easier
to start by example.

610
00:25:01,006 --> 00:25:03,496 A:middle
You are going to get a large
file captures all the details

611
00:25:04,456 --> 00:25:06,796 A:middle
and it's valid by definition

612
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,736 A:middle
because it's actually
emitted from the store.

613
00:25:09,186 --> 00:25:12,156 A:middle
So you will see all the areas
where you can make edits to it

614
00:25:12,156 --> 00:25:14,196 A:middle
and it's a lot easier to put
it together than to start

615
00:25:14,196 --> 00:25:17,786 A:middle
from scratch from a spec. So
let's say you took that advice

616
00:25:17,906 --> 00:25:20,996 A:middle
and you added keywords and
added some screen shots

617
00:25:20,996 --> 00:25:23,156 A:middle
and a localization.

618
00:25:23,156 --> 00:25:26,096 A:middle
Go ahead and validate it.

619
00:25:27,196 --> 00:25:31,276 A:middle
Same command, Transporter,
different mode, verify.

620
00:25:32,326 --> 00:25:36,536 A:middle
You use your iTunes Connect
user name, and supply a path

621
00:25:36,956 --> 00:25:38,516 A:middle
to the package that you
have been working on.

622
00:25:38,516 --> 00:25:40,176 A:middle
That's the one that
has the metadata XML

623
00:25:40,176 --> 00:25:41,346 A:middle
and all the assets
that you have added.

624
00:25:42,346 --> 00:25:44,806 A:middle
So what is going to
happen here is we are going

625
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:47,916 A:middle
to use exactly the same
rules that we apply

626
00:25:48,196 --> 00:25:49,956 A:middle
on iTunes Connect the web GUI,

627
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,076 A:middle
to validate what
you have September.

628
00:25:52,076 --> 00:25:52,886 A:middle
We will check all the I.Ds.

629
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:54,766 A:middle
We will check all the
required fields and the lengths

630
00:25:54,766 --> 00:25:58,486 A:middle
of the field and the
dimensions of the screen shots

631
00:25:58,486 --> 00:25:59,656 A:middle
that you are sending
to make sure

632
00:25:59,786 --> 00:26:01,446 A:middle
that they match the
devices that they are for.

633

634
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

635
00:25:59,786 --> 00:26:01,446 A:middle
that they match the
devices that they are for.

636
00:26:02,806 --> 00:26:04,296 A:middle
If there are any errors,
we will report it back

637
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:05,416 A:middle
to you right on the
command line.

638
00:26:06,706 --> 00:26:07,956 A:middle
And if you don't
have any errors,

639
00:26:07,956 --> 00:26:09,786 A:middle
then go ahead and upload it.

640
00:26:10,226 --> 00:26:12,946 A:middle
This is the same command,
transporter, iTMSTransporter

641
00:26:13,836 --> 00:26:16,146 A:middle
with a different mode, upload.

642
00:26:16,146 --> 00:26:16,956 A:middle
That's the only difference.

643
00:26:18,386 --> 00:26:22,856 A:middle
Your iTunes Connect user name
and the path to the package

644
00:26:22,856 --> 00:26:24,766 A:middle
that you have been
putting together all along.

645
00:26:25,456 --> 00:26:27,866 A:middle
So what's going to happen here
is we are going to actually run

646
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:30,226 A:middle
through the validation mode
first, in case you skipped it,

647
00:26:30,226 --> 00:26:31,256 A:middle
we will apply it anyways.

648
00:26:32,016 --> 00:26:34,366 A:middle
Same rules as would
apply in iTunes Connect.

649
00:26:35,276 --> 00:26:38,196 A:middle
If there are any errors, they
will be reported back to you

650
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:39,696 A:middle
and the upload will be blocked.

651
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:44,076 A:middle
If there are no errors then
the app upload will succeed

652
00:26:44,256 --> 00:26:47,226 A:middle
and we will get it
on our servers and at

653
00:26:47,226 --> 00:26:49,276 A:middle
that point it's asynchronous.

654
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,696 A:middle
So it's in the queue
to be processed,

655
00:26:51,696 --> 00:26:57,616 A:middle
alongside the binaries and
any other content we process.

656
00:26:58,136 --> 00:27:02,286 A:middle
And it might take a
minute or two for it to be,

657

658
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

659
00:26:58,136 --> 00:27:02,286 A:middle
And it might take a
minute or two for it to be,

660
00:27:02,286 --> 00:27:04,426 A:middle
as we say ingested and
appear on iTunes Connect.

661
00:27:04,496 --> 00:27:07,876 A:middle
You can actually use one of the
commands in Transporter to look

662
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:12,406 A:middle
up the current state
of that process.

663
00:27:12,546 --> 00:27:14,066 A:middle
In order to take
advantage of all of this,

664
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:16,226 A:middle
there are two pieces of
documentation that you need.

665
00:27:16,286 --> 00:27:18,546 A:middle
They are available
on the resources

666
00:27:18,546 --> 00:27:20,046 A:middle
and the help screen
on iTunes Connect.

667
00:27:20,756 --> 00:27:23,016 A:middle
The app metadata
specification for all the tags

668
00:27:23,846 --> 00:27:26,206 A:middle
and a Transporter user
guide for all the commands

669
00:27:26,876 --> 00:27:28,646 A:middle
and all the options
which is a lot more

670
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:29,676 A:middle
than I will go through here.

671
00:27:29,676 --> 00:27:30,286 A:middle
All right.

672
00:27:31,856 --> 00:27:34,306 A:middle
We are ready to see that XML.

673
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,026 A:middle
So this is what it
would look like.

674
00:27:36,026 --> 00:27:37,806 A:middle
This is how metadata
XML would look like.

675
00:27:38,236 --> 00:27:42,516 A:middle
There are required elements
forming a sort of envelope

676
00:27:42,516 --> 00:27:43,426 A:middle
around everything else.

677
00:27:43,846 --> 00:27:48,126 A:middle
So you have the package,
for your team ID.

678
00:27:49,196 --> 00:27:51,846 A:middle
You have software because this
is what we are discussing here,

679
00:27:51,846 --> 00:27:52,076 A:middle
right?

680
00:27:53,026 --> 00:27:56,326 A:middle
Your app is identified by the
vendor ID which is the app SKU

681
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,836 A:middle
and then the software metadata

682
00:27:58,836 --> 00:28:00,406 A:middle
because this is what
you are about to send.

683

684
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

685
00:27:58,836 --> 00:28:00,406 A:middle
because this is what
you are about to send.

686
00:28:01,726 --> 00:28:04,916 A:middle
Everything else is
optional elements.

687
00:28:05,326 --> 00:28:08,906 A:middle
They are optional in the
sense that only those

688
00:28:08,906 --> 00:28:09,926 A:middle
that have some changes,

689
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,246 A:middle
only those that you
actually need to send in.

690
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:13,916 A:middle
So, for example, if you
are making some changes

691
00:28:13,916 --> 00:28:16,386 A:middle
to the purchases, just
send that section.

692
00:28:17,246 --> 00:28:19,826 A:middle
This is not to say that you
can't send the whole thing

693
00:28:19,826 --> 00:28:20,276 A:middle
back in.

694
00:28:20,646 --> 00:28:21,676 A:middle
It is going to work fine.

695
00:28:21,736 --> 00:28:23,866 A:middle
Let's say you followed
that advice I had

696
00:28:24,326 --> 00:28:25,996 A:middle
about doing a metadata
lookup first.

697
00:28:26,396 --> 00:28:30,476 A:middle
You got the package and made
a few minor edits and decided

698
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:33,016 A:middle
to send the whole thing
back in, perfectly fine.

699
00:28:33,016 --> 00:28:33,596 A:middle
That will work.

700
00:28:34,156 --> 00:28:36,276 A:middle
We are capable of seeing
where the changes are

701
00:28:36,276 --> 00:28:38,636 A:middle
and applying those and ignoring
the sections that didn't change.

702
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:40,946 A:middle
It's all up to you
how to structure it.

703
00:28:42,406 --> 00:28:47,306 A:middle
So diving in, into this
-- into the package here,

704
00:28:47,646 --> 00:28:49,706 A:middle
just to call your
attention to the team ID,

705
00:28:49,706 --> 00:28:51,676 A:middle
is a value that you
received originally

706
00:28:51,676 --> 00:28:53,366 A:middle
when you created your
team account with Apple

707
00:28:54,116 --> 00:28:56,596 A:middle
and your app is identified
by the vendor ID

708
00:28:56,596 --> 00:28:57,816 A:middle
which is the app's SKU.

709
00:28:58,376 --> 00:29:03,966 A:middle
And the next step
depends on what it is

710

711
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

712
00:28:58,376 --> 00:29:03,966 A:middle
And the next step
depends on what it is

713
00:29:04,216 --> 00:29:05,616 A:middle
that you are trying to do.

714
00:29:05,706 --> 00:29:07,096 A:middle
Which area are you editing?

715
00:29:07,286 --> 00:29:09,366 A:middle
Let's say you are editing
some localization --

716
00:29:09,366 --> 00:29:11,286 A:middle
something about localization,
adding a description

717
00:29:11,286 --> 00:29:11,946 A:middle
or something like that.

718
00:29:12,636 --> 00:29:16,536 A:middle
Just like in iTunes Connect,
you get to select one of up

719
00:29:16,586 --> 00:29:19,676 A:middle
to two versions that you
are trying to target.

720
00:29:19,846 --> 00:29:22,536 A:middle
The one that's currently
on the store

721
00:29:22,746 --> 00:29:23,896 A:middle
and maybe the one
you are building

722
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:24,886 A:middle
up for the next release.

723
00:29:25,246 --> 00:29:27,126 A:middle
So in the XML, would you do

724
00:29:27,126 --> 00:29:31,066 A:middle
that by using the iTunes Connect
version stream, version 1.5

725
00:29:31,796 --> 00:29:34,016 A:middle
or the 2.0 in this example.

726
00:29:34,686 --> 00:29:38,136 A:middle
And for the sake of argument,
let's say you are interested

727
00:29:38,136 --> 00:29:39,516 A:middle
in editing the 2.0 version.

728
00:29:40,026 --> 00:29:42,406 A:middle
So the next slide is we
are diving down into that,

729
00:29:43,096 --> 00:29:44,146 A:middle
and what's the next step?

730
00:29:45,006 --> 00:29:46,516 A:middle
Select a language you
are talking about.

731
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:49,896 A:middle
So let's say in the -- in
iTunes Connect, would you do

732
00:29:49,896 --> 00:29:52,206 A:middle
that by using a pull
down for English.

733
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:55,176 A:middle
In the XML, it would be locale,

734
00:29:55,176 --> 00:29:59,766 A:middle
name and the BCP47 tag
identifying the language.

735

736
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

737
00:30:00,896 --> 00:30:03,406 A:middle
BCP47 is a format --

738
00:30:03,406 --> 00:30:05,586 A:middle
is a standard for
identifying any language spoken

739
00:30:05,586 --> 00:30:08,596 A:middle
on this planet, and I
think a few off the planet.

740
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:11,686 A:middle
But they are only ones
that you can only use

741
00:30:11,686 --> 00:30:14,236 A:middle
in the feed are the ones that
the store is localized in.

742
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:16,306 A:middle
So those are 28 and
they are listed

743
00:30:16,306 --> 00:30:19,446 A:middle
in the spec. Please take a look.

744
00:30:19,896 --> 00:30:25,786 A:middle
Let's say ENUS for US English
and diving further down.

745
00:30:25,786 --> 00:30:28,426 A:middle
Now we are finally down to
the actual data elements.

746
00:30:28,926 --> 00:30:32,236 A:middle
We have the title which is the
app name and the description.

747
00:30:33,246 --> 00:30:34,296 A:middle
We have the version
of what's new

748
00:30:34,296 --> 00:30:35,346 A:middle
if it happens to be an update.

749
00:30:36,526 --> 00:30:39,196 A:middle
And really, any element that
you encounter in iTunes Connect

750
00:30:39,196 --> 00:30:43,356 A:middle
at this point has a
representative tag in the XML.

751
00:30:43,356 --> 00:30:46,066 A:middle
I won't go through all of
them, other than to stay

752
00:30:46,066 --> 00:30:48,136 A:middle
for a few seconds
on screen shots

753
00:30:48,136 --> 00:30:49,916 A:middle
because those are just
a bit more involved.

754
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:53,836 A:middle
For each screen shot,
you would need

755
00:30:53,836 --> 00:30:56,456 A:middle
to tell us what device
they are for.

756
00:30:56,576 --> 00:30:59,616 A:middle
So that's the dismay target
and all of the iPhones

757
00:30:59,616 --> 00:31:02,346 A:middle
and Apple Watch and
iPad and if it happens

758

759
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

760
00:30:59,616 --> 00:31:02,346 A:middle
and Apple Watch and
iPad and if it happens

761
00:31:02,346 --> 00:31:04,506 A:middle
to be a Mac app is
the option there

762
00:31:05,336 --> 00:31:07,906 A:middle
and which position you want
that screen shot to appear

763
00:31:07,906 --> 00:31:10,136 A:middle
on the store and they go
from one to five, remember,

764
00:31:10,136 --> 00:31:11,356 A:middle
up to five per device.

765
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:15,266 A:middle
Specify the size of
the file in bytes.

766
00:31:16,106 --> 00:31:19,166 A:middle
The file name, which is of the
file that you would park next

767
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:20,936 A:middle
to metadata XML in the package,

768
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:25,416 A:middle
give us the MD5 checksum,
and onwards.

769
00:31:26,026 --> 00:31:30,666 A:middle
Let's say what you
wanted to do is set

770
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:32,206 A:middle
up some pricing parameters
instead.

771
00:31:33,566 --> 00:31:35,636 A:middle
Like in iTunes Connect, and
I think you might be picking

772
00:31:35,636 --> 00:31:38,516 A:middle
up a theme here, that it's --
it's -- they are equivalent.

773
00:31:39,176 --> 00:31:40,966 A:middle
Most of these are
applicable worldwide.

774
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:45,296 A:middle
So the XML product
equivalent section is

775
00:31:45,426 --> 00:31:47,476 A:middle
in the product for territory WW.

776
00:31:48,636 --> 00:31:51,896 A:middle
And at that level, you get to
state what your available date

777
00:31:51,896 --> 00:31:54,516 A:middle
for the app is, the sales
start date and things

778
00:31:54,516 --> 00:31:58,956 A:middle
like the educational
discount and also still

779
00:31:58,956 --> 00:32:03,016 A:middle
on the same level, also
territory WW for worldwide,

780

781
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

782
00:31:58,956 --> 00:32:03,016 A:middle
on the same level, also
territory WW for worldwide,

783
00:32:03,716 --> 00:32:05,446 A:middle
what is the pricing
tier for your app?

784
00:32:06,326 --> 00:32:09,046 A:middle
So here's wholesale price
Tier 3, corresponding

785
00:32:09,046 --> 00:32:13,206 A:middle
to the same option in the GUI
and the effective dates of it,

786
00:32:13,406 --> 00:32:15,686 A:middle
the start date and the end date.

787
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:20,696 A:middle
Notice for a second that those
appear inside an interval tag,

788
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:23,876 A:middle
which is itself an interval
section and what that builds

789
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:27,616 A:middle
up to is the ability to do
this advanced scheduling

790
00:32:27,616 --> 00:32:28,606 A:middle
of your price changes.

791
00:32:29,106 --> 00:32:32,256 A:middle
So in iTunes Connect, for
example, here's a map that goes

792
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,936 A:middle
on sale today for
five days, right?

793
00:32:34,656 --> 00:32:38,156 A:middle
Price Tier 3 goes down to price
Tier 1 and then comes back to 3,

794
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:40,346 A:middle
exactly the same
way in the feed.

795
00:32:41,006 --> 00:32:46,786 A:middle
You have the initial interval,
and the wholesale Price Tier 3

796
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:53,646 A:middle
and then it goes down to Tier 1
for five days and back up to 3.

797
00:32:53,646 --> 00:32:57,016 A:middle
Notice no end date there, which
means it's effective forever,

798
00:32:58,016 --> 00:33:00,836 A:middle
until you decide to change
that with a next update.

799

800
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

801
00:32:58,016 --> 00:33:00,836 A:middle
until you decide to change
that with a next update.

802
00:33:02,326 --> 00:33:05,916 A:middle
What is available on
the per territory basis,

803
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:07,006 A:middle
per country basis?

804
00:33:07,006 --> 00:33:10,016 A:middle
It's just the setting of whether
your app is available there

805
00:33:10,016 --> 00:33:10,336 A:middle
or not.

806
00:33:10,836 --> 00:33:12,606 A:middle
You can do that by
exclusion or inclusion.

807
00:33:12,986 --> 00:33:15,016 A:middle
In exclusion, you state
that it's available

808
00:33:15,296 --> 00:33:17,726 A:middle
for sale everywhere,
and then enumerate

809
00:33:17,836 --> 00:33:20,376 A:middle
through territories specifically
like Japan over there,

810
00:33:20,676 --> 00:33:22,846 A:middle
where you don't want the app
to be available for sale.

811
00:33:24,026 --> 00:33:25,226 A:middle
So that's one option.

812
00:33:25,226 --> 00:33:27,316 A:middle
The other one is inclusion,
exactly the opposite.

813
00:33:27,686 --> 00:33:30,876 A:middle
For territory WW, your app
is not available for sale,

814
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:33,966 A:middle
meaning it's just not
clear for sale anywhere.

815
00:33:33,966 --> 00:33:36,436 A:middle
And spend specifically
enumerate the areas

816
00:33:36,706 --> 00:33:40,286 A:middle
where you want to
make it available.

817
00:33:40,356 --> 00:33:42,996 A:middle
In-app purchases.

818
00:33:42,996 --> 00:33:45,866 A:middle
This is the area where you can
probably get the most effect,

819
00:33:45,866 --> 00:33:47,646 A:middle
the most bang for the
buck for using the feed.

820
00:33:47,646 --> 00:33:50,986 A:middle
That's due to the sheer
number of in-app purchases

821
00:33:50,986 --> 00:33:51,956 A:middle
that some of your apps have.

822
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,116 A:middle
This is where we have
seen the most activity

823
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:59,166 A:middle
and this is a deep
enough section of the feed

824
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:01,006 A:middle
that I won't go through
the tags here.

825

826
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

827
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:01,006 A:middle
that I won't go through
the tags here.

828
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:03,636 A:middle
Please download the
documentation,

829
00:34:03,636 --> 00:34:04,326 A:middle
take a look there.

830
00:34:04,326 --> 00:34:07,786 A:middle
It's fully supported, what you
can do in the web interface,

831
00:34:07,786 --> 00:34:09,406 A:middle
you can do in the feed.

832
00:34:10,255 --> 00:34:12,626 A:middle
The same goes for
leaderboards and achievements.

833
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,076 A:middle
Fully supported.

834
00:34:15,366 --> 00:34:18,966 A:middle
Everything you can do in a
web GUI, you can do in a feed.

835
00:34:19,295 --> 00:34:20,536 A:middle
Please download the
documentation,

836
00:34:20,536 --> 00:34:25,676 A:middle
study it, and take advantage.

837
00:34:25,766 --> 00:34:30,856 A:middle
So in summary, what you have
able to you is Transporter,

838
00:34:30,946 --> 00:34:34,166 A:middle
the command line tool for
managing the interactions

839
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:35,795 A:middle
in your environment
and iTunes Connect

840
00:34:36,696 --> 00:34:40,485 A:middle
and app metadata XML feed for
all the areas that we covered.

841
00:34:41,085 --> 00:34:44,216 A:middle
And those are great
for automation.

842
00:34:44,576 --> 00:34:47,966 A:middle
They allow you to manage your
data in iTunes Connect in bulk.

843
00:34:48,906 --> 00:34:51,016 A:middle
You can get out of the
copy/paste business.

844
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,536 A:middle
And you can integrate
iTunes Connect

845
00:34:54,686 --> 00:34:55,755 A:middle
with your back-end systems.

846
00:34:55,755 --> 00:34:56,585 A:middle
Whatever those may be.

847
00:34:58,166 --> 00:35:00,326 A:middle
So get your hands on two
pieces of information,

848

849
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

850
00:34:58,166 --> 00:35:00,326 A:middle
So get your hands on two
pieces of information,

851
00:35:01,026 --> 00:35:05,306 A:middle
app metadata XML
feed for all the tags

852
00:35:05,306 --> 00:35:09,786 A:middle
and all the formats there
and Transporter user guide

853
00:35:10,656 --> 00:35:12,636 A:middle
for all the commands and
all the options to them.

854
00:35:13,356 --> 00:35:14,846 A:middle
And automate away!

855
00:35:15,806 --> 00:35:17,746 A:middle
And with that, back
to Paul and thank you.

856
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:23,546 A:middle
[Applause]

857
00:35:24,046 --> 00:35:24,266 A:middle
>> PAUL TURNER: Okay.

858
00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:24,626 A:middle
Thanks, Nik.

859
00:35:24,626 --> 00:35:25,396 A:middle
That was great.

860
00:35:26,076 --> 00:35:26,676 A:middle
Oh, my gosh!

861
00:35:26,926 --> 00:35:28,786 A:middle
I'm so lucky to work
with engineers like this.

862
00:35:28,786 --> 00:35:30,056 A:middle
All right, we are a
little pressed for time

863
00:35:30,056 --> 00:35:31,206 A:middle
and I will wrap it
up really quickly.

864
00:35:31,366 --> 00:35:32,616 A:middle
I want to let you know

865
00:35:32,616 --> 00:35:37,066 A:middle
that 1-800 song already
chartered on Apple Music.

866
00:35:37,066 --> 00:35:38,826 A:middle
You will see me at
the Grammys next year.

867
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:42,826 A:middle
We took a look at
help resources.

868
00:35:42,826 --> 00:35:43,706 A:middle
I hope you use them.

869
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:44,656 A:middle
Give us feedback on them.

870
00:35:44,656 --> 00:35:46,206 A:middle
I want to know what you need.

871
00:35:46,806 --> 00:35:52,186 A:middle
We took a look at TestFlight,
went over the resources

872
00:35:52,186 --> 00:35:54,576 A:middle
and then Nik's Transporter
and XML feeds.

873
00:35:55,116 --> 00:35:57,846 A:middle
For more information,
obviously the developer portal.

874
00:35:57,846 --> 00:36:01,086 A:middle
And you can contact our fearless
evangelist, Marc Malone.

878
00:36:02,256 --> 00:36:03,996 A:middle
Some related sessions
already happened

879
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:05,276 A:middle
but catch them on the replay.

880
00:36:05,276 --> 00:36:08,286 A:middle
The What's New in iTunes Connect
this morning was fantastic!

881
00:36:08,506 --> 00:36:11,566 A:middle
The App Analytics
lab was incredible.

882
00:36:11,866 --> 00:36:13,366 A:middle
I'm so happy that
you guys are here.

883
00:36:13,496 --> 00:36:14,976 A:middle
So come visit us and
have a great conference!

884
00:36:15,516 --> 00:36:19,500 A:middle
