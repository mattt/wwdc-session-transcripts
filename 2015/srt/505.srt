00:00:29,206 --> 00:00:29,636 A:middle
>> JONO WELLS: Good morning.

3
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:35,366 A:middle
Welcome to using Safari
to deliver and debug,

4
00:00:35,606 --> 00:00:37,476 A:middle
a responsive web design.

5
00:00:38,026 --> 00:00:39,376 A:middle
My name is Jono Wells.

6
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:45,536 A:middle
I am an engineer on the Safari
and WebKit team with Apple,

7
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:48,196 A:middle
and I'm really excited
to talk to you today.

8
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:52,276 A:middle
I have a great privilege
of being able to develop

9
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:54,826 A:middle
for the Development
Tools that are a part

10
00:00:54,826 --> 00:00:56,646 A:middle
of the Safari web browser.

11
00:00:57,146 --> 00:01:01,076 A:middle
I feel I'm privileged
because I love the web,

12

13
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

14
00:00:57,146 --> 00:01:01,076 A:middle
I feel I'm privileged
because I love the web,

15
00:01:01,076 --> 00:01:02,096 A:middle
as I'm sure you do.

16
00:01:02,256 --> 00:01:04,226 A:middle
I think Safari is
a great browser,

17
00:01:04,456 --> 00:01:06,806 A:middle
a really great platform.

18
00:01:07,816 --> 00:01:10,636 A:middle
It deserves world-class
Development Tools,

19
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:11,306 A:middle
wouldn't you agree?

20
00:01:11,786 --> 00:01:15,696 A:middle
Especially because we are
not just making content

21
00:01:15,796 --> 00:01:19,256 A:middle
in the web browser, we're making
content in our apps as well,

22
00:01:19,576 --> 00:01:21,726 A:middle
using web views and so
we want that content

23
00:01:21,846 --> 00:01:23,956 A:middle
to run great and look great.

24
00:01:25,316 --> 00:01:28,306 A:middle
So this morning, of course
we're going to be talking

25
00:01:28,306 --> 00:01:31,226 A:middle
about Web Inspector, a tool most

26
00:01:31,226 --> 00:01:32,946 A:middle
of you have probably
used before, hopefully.

27
00:01:32,946 --> 00:01:34,056 A:middle
We're also going to be talking

28
00:01:34,056 --> 00:01:37,906 A:middle
about a brand-new tool called
Responsive Design Mode.

29
00:01:38,996 --> 00:01:43,776 A:middle
With these two tools together
we're going to very rapidly

30
00:01:44,796 --> 00:01:49,366 A:middle
and very smartly improve
the quality of our site

31
00:01:49,606 --> 00:01:52,986 A:middle
and get a good solid
responsive design as a result.

32
00:01:53,866 --> 00:01:55,756 A:middle
Let's begin by talking
about Web Inspector.

33
00:01:57,066 --> 00:01:58,406 A:middle
This is Web Inspector,
of course.

34
00:01:58,826 --> 00:02:01,086 A:middle
This is the one you've been
working with for the last year.

35

36
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

37
00:01:58,826 --> 00:02:01,086 A:middle
This is the one you've been
working with for the last year.

38
00:02:01,086 --> 00:02:04,576 A:middle
We've come up with a lot
of great new features.

39
00:02:04,906 --> 00:02:06,976 A:middle
We've also gotten some
great feedback from you

40
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,645 A:middle
over the last year
about the interface.

41
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:13,096 A:middle
We took a lot of that to
heart and we changed things

42
00:02:13,096 --> 00:02:15,266 A:middle
around a little bit so
this is the Web Inspector

43
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:17,656 A:middle
that we're releasing with
this release of Safari.

44
00:02:18,156 --> 00:02:19,726 A:middle
Here it is.

45
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:23,656 A:middle
[Applause]

46
00:02:24,156 --> 00:02:25,526 A:middle
>> JONO WELLS: I suspect
some of you may be applauding

47
00:02:25,526 --> 00:02:27,436 A:middle
because there is a
dedicated elements tab

48
00:02:27,436 --> 00:02:28,256 A:middle
as you see up there.

49
00:02:28,506 --> 00:02:33,306 A:middle
We have a tab based
interface, all the tools

50
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:36,476 A:middle
that you would expect in Web
Inspector are here; resources,

51
00:02:36,776 --> 00:02:40,976 A:middle
timeline, the debugger, the
storage tab and a console tab.

52
00:02:40,976 --> 00:02:43,826 A:middle
But these are tabs so of
course you can get rid of ones

53
00:02:43,826 --> 00:02:45,606 A:middle
that you want to
get out of your way

54
00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:46,586 A:middle
if there are tools
you don't work

55
00:02:46,586 --> 00:02:48,706 A:middle
with as often you can just
move them out of the way,

56
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,086 A:middle
you can reorganize the ones
that are already there,

57
00:02:51,116 --> 00:02:54,296 A:middle
if you want to bring one back,
you just hit the plus button

58
00:02:54,296 --> 00:02:57,116 A:middle
on the right-hand side and open
up whichever one you want to.

59
00:02:57,626 --> 00:03:00,176 A:middle
We give you the ability
to customize Web Inspector

60

61
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

62
00:02:57,626 --> 00:03:00,176 A:middle
We give you the ability
to customize Web Inspector

63
00:03:00,176 --> 00:03:03,916 A:middle
to look more like what you
want, to work the way you do.

64
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:06,716 A:middle
We've made improvements
to the interface there.

65
00:03:07,406 --> 00:03:10,046 A:middle
Now let's talk about
what new things we can do

66
00:03:10,046 --> 00:03:13,056 A:middle
with Web Inspector and
how it can help us.

67
00:03:13,056 --> 00:03:16,236 A:middle
The first one is, it can
help us get great performance

68
00:03:16,526 --> 00:03:17,466 A:middle
out of our content.

69
00:03:17,466 --> 00:03:18,676 A:middle
It helps you get
great performance.

70
00:03:19,146 --> 00:03:21,786 A:middle
Now it almost dragoons you
to get great performance

71
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:22,796 A:middle
and we'll talk about how.

72
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,166 A:middle
What do I mean when I
say great performance?

73
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:29,566 A:middle
The gold standard as I'm
sure most of you know,

74
00:03:29,756 --> 00:03:33,346 A:middle
is 60 frames per second, because
our screens are refreshing

75
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,116 A:middle
at 60 Hertz, 60 times a second.

76
00:03:35,926 --> 00:03:39,836 A:middle
This means that if we are trying
to render a smooth animation,

77
00:03:40,276 --> 00:03:42,926 A:middle
right, for any given
rendering frame, right,

78
00:03:42,926 --> 00:03:46,306 A:middle
in a turn of the event loop
we need to make sure all

79
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:48,596 A:middle
of our scripts, our
timers, and our layout

80
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:52,686 A:middle
and rendering can happen
within 16.67 milliseconds.

81
00:03:53,306 --> 00:03:57,926 A:middle
If we blow this budget, then
our animation will stutter

82
00:03:57,926 --> 00:03:59,486 A:middle
and that's not something
that we want.

83

84
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

85
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:05,396 A:middle
How can we get better
information

86
00:04:05,396 --> 00:04:08,806 A:middle
to help us debug the
performance of our content?

87
00:04:09,536 --> 00:04:10,376 A:middle
We have this idea.

88
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:13,576 A:middle
What if you could just
look at the content

89
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:15,096 A:middle
and every time a paint occurs,

90
00:04:15,836 --> 00:04:19,856 A:middle
we just flash a region
of the screen?

91
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,005 A:middle
We added something
called Paint Flashing.

92
00:04:22,146 --> 00:04:24,626 A:middle
When you're in the elements tab,
in the upper right-hand corner,

93
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,266 A:middle
you will see this paintbrush.

94
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,726 A:middle
Click that, turn that on.

95
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:32,936 A:middle
When that is lit up blue, every
single time a paint occurs

96
00:04:32,936 --> 00:04:37,156 A:middle
on your page it will light up
red with a translucent red box.

97
00:04:37,956 --> 00:04:39,736 A:middle
You're going to want to
try this on your content.

98
00:04:39,736 --> 00:04:41,176 A:middle
It going to light up
like a Christmas tree.

99
00:04:41,176 --> 00:04:41,896 A:middle
It is amazing!

100
00:04:41,896 --> 00:04:44,616 A:middle
It's going to look like a game
of Simon if you ever played

101
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:48,746 A:middle
that with a kid -- as a kid.

102
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:50,446 A:middle
That's going to give you a sense

103
00:04:50,676 --> 00:04:52,186 A:middle
that perhaps you're
painting too often,

104
00:04:52,406 --> 00:04:53,946 A:middle
there's too much
happening on your page.

105
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:56,886 A:middle
But what about what's
happening behind the scenes?

106
00:04:57,876 --> 00:04:59,476 A:middle
To help you get more
information there

107
00:04:59,706 --> 00:05:02,346 A:middle
and get you towards 60 frames
per second performance,

108

109
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

110
00:04:59,706 --> 00:05:02,346 A:middle
and get you towards 60 frames
per second performance,

111
00:05:02,706 --> 00:05:04,846 A:middle
we've added a great new tool
called the Rendering Frames

112
00:05:04,926 --> 00:05:05,466 A:middle
Time Line.

113
00:05:06,016 --> 00:05:10,666 A:middle
If you go to the time
lines tab you can get to it

114
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,836 A:middle
by clicking right here
on Rendering Frames

115
00:05:13,016 --> 00:05:14,416 A:middle
and this is the interface
you will see.

116
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:17,736 A:middle
When -- so you can
record, use your site

117
00:05:17,736 --> 00:05:19,506 A:middle
and we will start
drawing these bars.

118
00:05:19,506 --> 00:05:22,276 A:middle
Each one of these bars
represents a rendering frame.

119
00:05:22,596 --> 00:05:25,086 A:middle
They're segmented into
different colors based

120
00:05:25,086 --> 00:05:26,446 A:middle
on what is happening
in each frame.

121
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:30,496 A:middle
Purple for scripts, event
timers and such, red for layout

122
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,116 A:middle
and rendering and gray for
behind the scenes engine work

123
00:05:34,356 --> 00:05:35,506 A:middle
that the engine is doing.

124
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:39,096 A:middle
The goal is to keep each

125
00:05:39,096 --> 00:05:42,566 A:middle
of these bars underneath
the middle line right here,

126
00:05:43,516 --> 00:05:44,976 A:middle
the 60 frames per second line.

127
00:05:45,306 --> 00:05:47,376 A:middle
If your bars tend
to go above that,

128
00:05:47,706 --> 00:05:50,526 A:middle
it means you're possibly
not going

129
00:05:50,526 --> 00:05:52,206 A:middle
to be getting 60 frames
per second performance

130
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:54,556 A:middle
and we want to work on that.

131
00:05:55,006 --> 00:05:57,516 A:middle
You can select a region of
the bars just like you can

132
00:05:57,516 --> 00:06:00,286 A:middle
on the other timeline, and
we're going to show you a lot

133

134
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

135
00:05:57,516 --> 00:06:00,286 A:middle
on the other timeline, and
we're going to show you a lot

136
00:06:00,286 --> 00:06:01,376 A:middle
of good information about that.

137
00:06:01,376 --> 00:06:03,636 A:middle
First of all, we're going to
show you this graph right here,

138
00:06:03,636 --> 00:06:06,266 A:middle
this is an aggregate of
the different activity

139
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:07,796 A:middle
that is happening in
that particular region.

140
00:06:07,796 --> 00:06:11,866 A:middle
We're going to give you a
breakdown of each frame.

141
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:13,756 A:middle
You can open up every
single rendering frame

142
00:06:13,756 --> 00:06:15,126 A:middle
and see exactly what's
happening.

143
00:06:15,726 --> 00:06:18,916 A:middle
For things like event
timers and rendering,

144
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:22,366 A:middle
style and validation inside of
your code we have the ability,

145
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:24,906 A:middle
of course, to click to the
relevant line of source codes

146
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:26,116 A:middle
so you can see what's going on.

147
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:29,636 A:middle
We also show you this table
of timing information.

148
00:06:30,396 --> 00:06:32,366 A:middle
One of my favorite things to
do, I have been using this

149
00:06:32,366 --> 00:06:35,456 A:middle
for a bit, what's been really
helpful for me is to sort

150
00:06:35,456 --> 00:06:38,376 A:middle
by total time for reach
Rendering Frame and then I open

151
00:06:38,376 --> 00:06:40,836 A:middle
up the one on the top
because it is most likely

152
00:06:41,116 --> 00:06:44,126 A:middle
that the most offensive
frames are at the top

153
00:06:44,126 --> 00:06:46,326 A:middle
and then I can see what is
holding back my performance.

154
00:06:47,186 --> 00:06:52,026 A:middle
This tool is going to tell you a
great story about your content.

155
00:06:52,176 --> 00:06:55,006 A:middle
Even if you think you're
performing well, you're going

156
00:06:55,006 --> 00:06:57,456 A:middle
to want to hookup
to this and see

157
00:06:57,456 --> 00:07:00,196 A:middle
if you can get additional
performance out of your site.

158

159
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

160
00:06:57,456 --> 00:07:00,196 A:middle
if you can get additional
performance out of your site.

161
00:07:00,866 --> 00:07:03,266 A:middle
It tells you a great
story, it allows you to do

162
00:07:03,436 --> 00:07:05,776 A:middle
without thinking, that's really
what we want our development

163
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:06,626 A:middle
tools to do.

164
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:09,256 A:middle
Just to put the information out
in front of you and say here,

165
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:14,686 A:middle
here it is, you don't have
to work too hard to get it.

166
00:07:14,946 --> 00:07:17,506 A:middle
One of the things that we've
been noticing is that you have

167
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:19,086 A:middle
to jump around between
different tools

168
00:07:19,086 --> 00:07:20,326 A:middle
within Web Inspector a lot.

169
00:07:21,646 --> 00:07:24,186 A:middle
We thought it'd be great if you
could focus on a particular one.

170
00:07:24,906 --> 00:07:27,186 A:middle
More often if you can
just stay in one tool

171
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:28,686 A:middle
that might save you time.

172
00:07:29,546 --> 00:07:31,046 A:middle
We've done this in a few ways.

173
00:07:31,196 --> 00:07:34,376 A:middle
One of the ways is for errors

174
00:07:34,376 --> 00:07:37,206 A:middle
and warnings we don't just
show those in the console now,

175
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,626 A:middle
we show them in a
few other places

176
00:07:38,846 --> 00:07:40,316 A:middle
so that you can spot
them more quickly.

177
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:42,776 A:middle
In the debugger side-bar
for instance on the left,

178
00:07:43,676 --> 00:07:46,236 A:middle
any resource that has an error
warning we'll just show them

179
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:50,256 A:middle
underneath, they'll appear so
you can just jump right to them.

180
00:07:50,466 --> 00:07:54,556 A:middle
In all of the JavaScript code in
your site, we'll show the errors

181
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:57,756 A:middle
and warnings in line so
you'll see those messages.

182
00:07:57,786 --> 00:07:59,756 A:middle
So if you're just browsing,
everything will just show up.

183
00:07:59,756 --> 00:08:00,546 A:middle
It's a lot nicer.

184

185
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

186
00:07:59,756 --> 00:08:00,546 A:middle
It's a lot nicer.

187
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:04,026 A:middle
We have also improved the
way they look in the console

188
00:08:04,356 --> 00:08:06,146 A:middle
so errors and warnings,
they're highlighted,

189
00:08:06,146 --> 00:08:08,426 A:middle
the colors are easily
distinguishable.

190
00:08:09,506 --> 00:08:10,456 A:middle
They just look better too,

191
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,016 A:middle
we've made the fonts
better, it's great.

192
00:08:12,486 --> 00:08:19,116 A:middle
We have this other idea,
and again we want to Do

193
00:08:19,116 --> 00:08:20,066 A:middle
Without Thinking, we want

194
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,606 A:middle
to put important
information in front of you.

195
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:24,876 A:middle
JavaScript of course, is a
dynamically typed language.

196
00:08:25,406 --> 00:08:27,976 A:middle
That means that the engine
itself assigns the types

197
00:08:27,976 --> 00:08:29,176 A:middle
for you, you don't have to.

198
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,796 A:middle
This is what's happening
behind the scenes in this case.

199
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:34,926 A:middle
Right. We have a string, we have
an integer, we have an object.

200
00:08:36,426 --> 00:08:39,736 A:middle
If you're working
with some code,

201
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:41,265 A:middle
here's a function
that's designed

202
00:08:41,265 --> 00:08:42,416 A:middle
to add two numbers together,

203
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,836 A:middle
and this is a mistake
that might happen.

204
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:48,966 A:middle
We're accidentally passing in
a string, and so that is going

205
00:08:48,966 --> 00:08:50,626 A:middle
to lead to some unexpected
results we're going

206
00:08:50,626 --> 00:08:51,396 A:middle
to call a dysfunction.

207
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:55,516 A:middle
This is something that you can
discover by trying to debug,

208
00:08:55,516 --> 00:08:56,846 A:middle
and play around with
your code, might be a,

209
00:08:57,096 --> 00:08:58,386 A:middle
in a more complicated case,

210
00:08:58,386 --> 00:08:59,676 A:middle
might be hard to
find this error.

211
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:01,836 A:middle
But, what if you could
see something like this

212

213
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

214
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:01,836 A:middle
But, what if you could
see something like this

215
00:09:02,086 --> 00:09:05,356 A:middle
where we just show you
as your code is running,

216
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:07,396 A:middle
we show you the types
that have been assigned

217
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:11,816 A:middle
to all the different variables,
passed in as parameters,

218
00:09:12,116 --> 00:09:13,456 A:middle
or return from functions.

219
00:09:14,956 --> 00:09:17,186 A:middle
We created just such a thing.

220
00:09:17,706 --> 00:09:19,656 A:middle
We call this the
Type Profiling Tool.

221
00:09:19,656 --> 00:09:21,266 A:middle
If you look in the
upper right-hand corner

222
00:09:21,346 --> 00:09:21,786 A:middle
when you're looking

223
00:09:21,786 --> 00:09:25,686 A:middle
at any JavaScript source you'll
see this T button right here.

224
00:09:25,686 --> 00:09:28,106 A:middle
If you click that, from
that point forward,

225
00:09:28,106 --> 00:09:30,346 A:middle
when your code runs, your code
is going to go from looking

226
00:09:30,546 --> 00:09:33,796 A:middle
like this to looking like this.

227
00:09:34,516 --> 00:09:38,866 A:middle
[Applause]

228
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:40,536 A:middle
>> JONO WELLS: I love this tool!

229
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:41,276 A:middle
It's so cool!

230
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:43,726 A:middle
I've been using it a lot
working on Web Inspector.

231
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:48,226 A:middle
We're going to show you as
best as we can type information

232
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:51,366 A:middle
as your variables
are assigned values.

233
00:09:51,526 --> 00:09:54,146 A:middle
You'll also notice that some
of the code is grayed out.

234
00:09:54,396 --> 00:09:56,366 A:middle
Since we're tracking what
code has been covered,

235
00:09:56,976 --> 00:09:58,096 A:middle
any code that hasn't
been reached

236
00:09:58,096 --> 00:09:59,256 A:middle
yet will be grayed out for you.

237
00:09:59,486 --> 00:10:01,866 A:middle
So this also serves as a
great code coverage tool.

238

239
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

240
00:09:59,486 --> 00:10:01,866 A:middle
So this also serves as a
great code coverage tool.

241
00:10:02,346 --> 00:10:04,826 A:middle
Right. It going to
allow you to see

242
00:10:04,826 --> 00:10:06,136 A:middle
if a function isn't being run

243
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:10,226 A:middle
or if an else condition isn't
being reached, things like that.

244
00:10:11,496 --> 00:10:13,416 A:middle
You'll also notice that we
show you the return value

245
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:14,126 A:middle
from a function.

246
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:16,296 A:middle
In this case I have a function
that's returning something

247
00:10:16,296 --> 00:10:19,296 A:middle
called a DeveloperPerson,
it's a class I wrote.

248
00:10:19,296 --> 00:10:21,026 A:middle
You'll also notice that
we're showing you the name

249
00:10:21,026 --> 00:10:21,836 A:middle
of that object.

250
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:25,356 A:middle
If you have constructer
functions, right, like this one,

251
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:27,826 A:middle
if you're using this classical
model using prototypes

252
00:10:28,266 --> 00:10:32,766 A:middle
and you construct an object that
way, we will show you the name

253
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:33,866 A:middle
of the constructer function.

254
00:10:34,076 --> 00:10:35,206 A:middle
We'll do the same
thing of course,

255
00:10:35,206 --> 00:10:38,366 A:middle
if you're using ES6
classes which just landed

256
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:43,466 A:middle
in this release, we'll show
you the name of the class.

257
00:10:43,896 --> 00:10:47,876 A:middle
Obviously parameters can
get past multiple values

258
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:49,546 A:middle
over the lifetime
of your application.

259
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,906 A:middle
What happens if you
have multiple types?

260
00:10:52,606 --> 00:10:54,266 A:middle
For objects here is
how we handle it.

261
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:57,786 A:middle
Let's say I have a
function called register.

262
00:10:58,636 --> 00:11:01,416 A:middle
Right. So we're going
to register somebody

263

264
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

265
00:10:58,636 --> 00:11:01,416 A:middle
Right. So we're going
to register somebody

266
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,106 A:middle
for a conference or
something like that.

267
00:11:03,816 --> 00:11:06,946 A:middle
Say I call it once, and I
pass in a new DeveloperPerson.

268
00:11:07,606 --> 00:11:09,906 A:middle
Well, we're just going to show
you that it's a DeveloperPerson.

269
00:11:09,906 --> 00:11:11,676 A:middle
If we pass in another object,

270
00:11:11,676 --> 00:11:13,206 A:middle
say a ManagerPerson,
we'll show you that.

271
00:11:13,436 --> 00:11:15,596 A:middle
Let's say we pass in
both a DeveloperPerson

272
00:11:15,596 --> 00:11:17,656 A:middle
and a ManagerPerson, then

273
00:11:17,656 --> 00:11:20,336 A:middle
since they both have a
common ancestor, person,

274
00:11:20,506 --> 00:11:21,636 A:middle
that's what we're
going to show you.

275
00:11:22,686 --> 00:11:24,096 A:middle
If we pass in something
else that isn't

276
00:11:24,096 --> 00:11:27,276 A:middle
in this inheritance chain at
all like an extraterrestrial

277
00:11:27,276 --> 00:11:30,186 A:middle
for instance, we'll
just show you object,

278
00:11:30,186 --> 00:11:35,146 A:middle
because of course everything
derives from object, right?

279
00:11:35,886 --> 00:11:37,936 A:middle
Now here are all the different
types that we might show you.

280
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:43,186 A:middle
If there are multiple types,
a string, and a number

281
00:11:43,186 --> 00:11:45,236 A:middle
that get assigned to a value,
this is what you're going to see

282
00:11:45,236 --> 00:11:48,116 A:middle
in your code, it's just
going to show you many.

283
00:11:48,116 --> 00:11:51,216 A:middle
There is an exception to this,
say you have a simple type

284
00:11:51,216 --> 00:11:54,636 A:middle
like a double and it's a
double sometimes and it's null

285
00:11:54,636 --> 00:11:57,386 A:middle
or undefined sometimes, we'll
just add a question mark

286
00:11:57,386 --> 00:11:59,226 A:middle
to the top, that means
it's double sometimes

287
00:11:59,546 --> 00:12:01,486 A:middle
or sometimes it's a null value.

288

289
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

290
00:11:59,546 --> 00:12:01,486 A:middle
or sometimes it's a null value.

291
00:12:02,006 --> 00:12:05,066 A:middle
This is such a nice feature,

292
00:12:05,066 --> 00:12:06,316 A:middle
I just want to show
you a few more shots.

293
00:12:06,516 --> 00:12:08,016 A:middle
This is code from
the Web Inspector.

294
00:12:08,386 --> 00:12:09,126 A:middle
It's just really nice.

295
00:12:09,126 --> 00:12:12,206 A:middle
It gives you a bird's eye
view of what's happening

296
00:12:12,206 --> 00:12:13,116 A:middle
with your application.

297
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:16,846 A:middle
You can quickly spot behavior
that isn't interesting to you.

298
00:12:17,006 --> 00:12:18,316 A:middle
Right. Here is an
object assignment.

299
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:21,756 A:middle
Again, you can see the coverage,

300
00:12:21,756 --> 00:12:23,676 A:middle
you can see areas
that are grayed out.

301
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:27,346 A:middle
This has been incredibly
useful in my development

302
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,486 A:middle
with Web Inspector,
I think you're going

303
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:29,676 A:middle
to find it just as
useful as well.

304
00:12:29,746 --> 00:12:31,066 A:middle
This is the type profiling tool.

305
00:12:32,516 --> 00:12:38,076 A:middle
[Applause]

306
00:12:38,576 --> 00:12:39,266 A:middle
>> JONO WELLS: All right.

307
00:12:39,796 --> 00:12:43,346 A:middle
We have also made
improvements to the console.

308
00:12:44,356 --> 00:12:46,206 A:middle
In a similar way
we want to be able

309
00:12:46,206 --> 00:12:48,616 A:middle
to put really useful
information in front of you

310
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,686 A:middle
without you having
to work too hard.

311
00:12:52,076 --> 00:12:54,676 A:middle
Here are some objects that we
have launched in the console.

312
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:56,326 A:middle
And you're going to
notice a few things.

313
00:12:56,846 --> 00:12:58,026 A:middle
The first one is that
we're creating --

314
00:12:58,336 --> 00:12:59,586 A:middle
we give you object preview,

315
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:01,736 A:middle
so you have really good
looking object previews

316

317
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

318
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:01,736 A:middle
so you have really good
looking object previews

319
00:13:02,086 --> 00:13:06,226 A:middle
so you might spot information
inside your object much

320
00:13:06,226 --> 00:13:06,826 A:middle
more quickly.

321
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:08,866 A:middle
You're also going to
notice something else,

322
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:10,756 A:middle
every time something is
output to the console,

323
00:13:11,226 --> 00:13:13,916 A:middle
we're going to store it
in a variable for you.

324
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,756 A:middle
This starts at dollar sign
1 and then dollar sign 2,

325
00:13:17,036 --> 00:13:18,826 A:middle
then dollar sign 3,
on and on and on.

326
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:23,376 A:middle
You can reference
them again just

327
00:13:23,376 --> 00:13:25,936 A:middle
by putting them in the console.

328
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:26,946 A:middle
This is great.

329
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:29,786 A:middle
The feedback that we got
from you, because these used

330
00:13:29,786 --> 00:13:33,386 A:middle
to represent recently selected
elements in the elements panel

331
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:36,486 A:middle
and the feedback was that really
everyone was only using one

332
00:13:36,486 --> 00:13:38,996 A:middle
of those, which is dollar
sign 0, so don't worry,

333
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:42,136 A:middle
that's still the currently
selected element, still there,

334
00:13:42,396 --> 00:13:44,336 A:middle
it'll still work as you
expect it to, but starting

335
00:13:44,336 --> 00:13:47,406 A:middle
with dollar sign one, those'll
be recently logged variables.

336
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:51,126 A:middle
That can be really useful,
right, if you're paused

337
00:13:51,126 --> 00:13:54,176 A:middle
in the debugger and there's a
value in the scope that you want

338
00:13:54,176 --> 00:13:57,066 A:middle
to remember, you no longer have
to go into your source code

339
00:13:57,456 --> 00:14:00,116 A:middle
and create a variable just
for debugging purposes

340

341
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

342
00:13:57,456 --> 00:14:00,116 A:middle
and create a variable just
for debugging purposes

343
00:14:00,116 --> 00:14:01,706 A:middle
and then save it,
and then run the app,

344
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:03,046 A:middle
then delete it later, or forget.

345
00:14:03,046 --> 00:14:04,336 A:middle
You don't have to do
any of that anymore,

346
00:14:04,596 --> 00:14:05,716 A:middle
we'll take care of that for you.

347
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:09,346 A:middle
What about when you open
up one of the objects.

348
00:14:09,836 --> 00:14:12,106 A:middle
You're going to see this.

349
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:13,196 A:middle
It's a lot nicer.

350
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:15,616 A:middle
First of all, we've
just improved the look

351
00:14:15,786 --> 00:14:18,386 A:middle
and used colors to
distinguish the different types

352
00:14:18,386 --> 00:14:21,476 A:middle
of information that can
be inside of an object.

353
00:14:21,476 --> 00:14:24,196 A:middle
Everyone of the objects
inside has its own preview.

354
00:14:24,356 --> 00:14:26,276 A:middle
You'll notice that this
is an array, siblings,

355
00:14:26,656 --> 00:14:28,406 A:middle
this one has a special
type of preview,

356
00:14:28,406 --> 00:14:32,206 A:middle
we've created special previews
for certain things, Maps, sets,

357
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:35,246 A:middle
weak sets, weak maps, promises.

358
00:14:36,546 --> 00:14:39,346 A:middle
Right. We show you the types
of the objects inside the array

359
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,316 A:middle
and the size of the
array on the right.

360
00:14:41,836 --> 00:14:44,736 A:middle
When you open it, we show you
the index of each object inside.

361
00:14:44,736 --> 00:14:46,346 A:middle
Of course, each of
those have a preview.

362
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:47,786 A:middle
I want you to notice here

363
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,706 A:middle
that we also have
made it a lot easier

364
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,716 A:middle
to inspect the prototype
chain so I can then open

365
00:14:52,716 --> 00:14:55,536 A:middle
up the prototype for developer
person and for person,

366
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:57,036 A:middle
and I might see something
like this.

367
00:14:58,376 --> 00:14:59,636 A:middle
I love this very much.

368

369
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

370
00:15:00,616 --> 00:15:03,906 A:middle
This gives me the ability to
essentially get an API view

371
00:15:03,996 --> 00:15:06,466 A:middle
of my object in the classes
that constructed this object.

372
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:09,656 A:middle
Look at this.

373
00:15:09,656 --> 00:15:11,676 A:middle
I can quickly spot and see okay,

374
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:14,706 A:middle
I have a function called
change name that takes

375
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:15,836 A:middle
in a first name and last name.

376
00:15:16,476 --> 00:15:20,056 A:middle
I have a custom setter
called firstName.

377
00:15:20,376 --> 00:15:24,486 A:middle
I have a custom getter
called fullName.

378
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:27,506 A:middle
I can tell that because
there's an eyeball next to it.

379
00:15:27,506 --> 00:15:28,706 A:middle
I can click on that eyeball

380
00:15:28,706 --> 00:15:31,596 A:middle
and it'll actually
run the custom getter.

381
00:15:32,636 --> 00:15:36,566 A:middle
This is almost better than the
documentation in some cases.

382
00:15:36,996 --> 00:15:39,716 A:middle
It is even great for
native API exploration,

383
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:40,946 A:middle
and some of you are
probably thinking,

384
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:44,326 A:middle
I can't remember how local
storage works, no problem,

385
00:15:44,506 --> 00:15:45,736 A:middle
just put it in the console.

386
00:15:45,826 --> 00:15:46,986 A:middle
I can see all of the functions,

387
00:15:47,176 --> 00:15:48,936 A:middle
it looks a lot better,
it's really nice.

388
00:15:49,336 --> 00:15:50,856 A:middle
Really great for
object exploration,

389
00:15:50,856 --> 00:15:53,836 A:middle
if you're exploring
third-party APIs, it's great.

390
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:55,646 A:middle
It's not just in
the console, either.

391
00:15:55,846 --> 00:15:58,416 A:middle
Anywhere we show object views,
for instance, if you're paused

392
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,886 A:middle
in the debugger and you have the
view of the variables in scope

393

394
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

395
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,886 A:middle
in the debugger and you have the
view of the variables in scope

396
00:16:01,886 --> 00:16:03,976 A:middle
on the right, or when
you're mousing over,

397
00:16:04,376 --> 00:16:07,896 A:middle
a variable in the source
view, let me show you that -

398
00:16:08,146 --> 00:16:11,096 A:middle
same beautiful object views
in all of those places.

399
00:16:12,076 --> 00:16:15,336 A:middle
Nicely organized for the type
of information that is in there,

400
00:16:15,746 --> 00:16:18,836 A:middle
you're going to spot
information more quickly

401
00:16:19,026 --> 00:16:21,016 A:middle
and that is really the
goal of all of this.

402
00:16:21,056 --> 00:16:26,406 A:middle
I now would like to invite my
friend and colleague Andy Estes

403
00:16:26,406 --> 00:16:29,136 A:middle
to come up to the stage and
he's been working on a site

404
00:16:29,526 --> 00:16:31,596 A:middle
that he's excited to
show you and maybe some

405
00:16:31,596 --> 00:16:32,756 A:middle
of these tools will
help him out.

406
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:32,976 A:middle
Andy.

407
00:16:33,516 --> 00:16:37,546 A:middle
[Applause]

408
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:40,606 A:middle
>> ANDY ESTES: Thank you, Jono
and thank you to all of you

409
00:16:40,606 --> 00:16:41,576 A:middle
for being here this morning.

410
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:42,836 A:middle
I'm really excited to be here

411
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,896 A:middle
and show you these new
tools in Web Inspector.

412
00:16:45,716 --> 00:16:48,676 A:middle
First, a bit of a confession, I
was up late last night working

413
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:51,116 A:middle
on this site, I wanted
it to look good.

414
00:16:51,516 --> 00:16:55,506 A:middle
It's supposed to display a
bunch of photography I've taken

415
00:16:55,816 --> 00:16:58,026 A:middle
and I think I've introduced
a bug and if you don't mind,

416
00:16:58,026 --> 00:17:00,606 A:middle
I just want to see if I can
figure out this bug I introduced

417

418
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

419
00:16:58,026 --> 00:17:00,606 A:middle
I just want to see if I can
figure out this bug I introduced

420
00:17:00,606 --> 00:17:02,596 A:middle
and fix it real quick
so I'm just going

421
00:17:02,596 --> 00:17:03,816 A:middle
to go into Web Inspector.

422
00:17:03,816 --> 00:17:05,736 A:middle
By the way, if you never
opened the inspector before,

423
00:17:05,935 --> 00:17:07,076 A:middle
you do it from the develop menu

424
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:08,906 A:middle
and you don't have a
develop menu in your Safari,

425
00:17:08,906 --> 00:17:10,976 A:middle
it's really easy to
enable, you simply go

426
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:12,046 A:middle
to Safari's preferences,

427
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:14,656 A:middle
and in the advanced tab
you'll see the option,

428
00:17:14,656 --> 00:17:17,396 A:middle
show development menu in mini
bar, I already have that checked

429
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:18,816 A:middle
so I'll just go right in there.

430
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:21,455 A:middle
I'm going to say Develop,
show Web Inspector.

431
00:17:22,266 --> 00:17:25,185 A:middle
It will open this up along the
bottom and right away I see

432
00:17:25,185 --> 00:17:27,346 A:middle
that I have an error
here in the console.

433
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:30,356 A:middle
I can click it, it looks like
undefined is not an object,

434
00:17:30,736 --> 00:17:33,576 A:middle
I can jump to the debugger,
I even have the error here

435
00:17:33,576 --> 00:17:35,046 A:middle
in the side-bar, I can click it,

436
00:17:35,046 --> 00:17:37,506 A:middle
it'll take me right
to the line of code.

437
00:17:37,936 --> 00:17:39,136 A:middle
Let's take a look at this.

438
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:42,216 A:middle
Somewhere in this line of code
I'm seeing an undefined value

439
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:43,116 A:middle
where I don't expect it.

440
00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:45,336 A:middle
Now typically what I would do
is I would set a break point

441
00:17:45,336 --> 00:17:48,406 A:middle
and maybe spend some time
debugging but I don't have time

442
00:17:48,406 --> 00:17:50,086 A:middle
for that, instead I
think I'm just going

443
00:17:50,086 --> 00:17:51,966 A:middle
to enable the type
profiling to see if maybe

444
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:54,526 A:middle
that can tell me
where my error is.

445
00:17:54,526 --> 00:17:57,356 A:middle
I'm going to click this T
to enable type profiling

446
00:17:57,356 --> 00:17:58,516 A:middle
and I'm going to
reload the site.

447

448
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

449
00:18:08,816 --> 00:18:10,306 A:middle
Great, so there's my error.

450
00:18:11,196 --> 00:18:12,656 A:middle
And now my source
code is annotated

451
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:13,666 A:middle
with these helpful pills

452
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,616 A:middle
that tell me the types
of all my variables.

453
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:17,406 A:middle
Let's just see if we can
quickly work this out.

454
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:21,416 A:middle
I have galleries,
which is an array.

455
00:18:22,366 --> 00:18:24,486 A:middle
I have current gallery
which is an imager.

456
00:18:24,566 --> 00:18:27,836 A:middle
The result of that
shouldn't be undefined

457
00:18:27,836 --> 00:18:30,516 A:middle
but I initialized
galleries up here,

458
00:18:30,516 --> 00:18:32,486 A:middle
and one of the things I'm
noticing is that the body

459
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,786 A:middle
of my four loop is grayed out,

460
00:18:33,786 --> 00:18:36,376 A:middle
that means that code hasn't
been covered, and it looks

461
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:39,256 A:middle
like that's because gallery
data itself is undefined.

462
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:40,886 A:middle
That's somewhat unexpected,

463
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,326 A:middle
I should be passing a
valid gallery data in here.

464
00:18:43,906 --> 00:18:47,776 A:middle
Gallery data itself comes from
this variable, this.options,

465
00:18:48,236 --> 00:18:49,986 A:middle
let's take a look
at where I set that.

466
00:18:50,116 --> 00:18:51,486 A:middle
I do that up in my constructer

467
00:18:51,486 --> 00:18:53,106 A:middle
for navigation galleries
controller.

468
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,846 A:middle
And it does look like I'm
passing a valid object

469
00:18:55,846 --> 00:18:58,466 A:middle
to the constructer, I see
the object pill right there.

470
00:18:58,466 --> 00:19:02,296 A:middle
I'm not passing a null or
some other kind of type.

471

472
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

473
00:18:58,466 --> 00:19:02,296 A:middle
I'm not passing a null or
some other kind of type.

474
00:19:02,486 --> 00:19:05,366 A:middle
Let's find where I construct
navigation galleries controller

475
00:19:05,366 --> 00:19:07,416 A:middle
and see if that tells
me what my mistake is.

476
00:19:07,866 --> 00:19:10,626 A:middle
I'm going to just copy this.

477
00:19:10,756 --> 00:19:13,506 A:middle
I'm going to use Web Inspectors'
global search and I can get

478
00:19:13,506 --> 00:19:15,796 A:middle
to that by command-shift-F
and it will search all

479
00:19:15,796 --> 00:19:17,416 A:middle
of the resources in the site.

480
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,436 A:middle
And I have exactly one place

481
00:19:20,436 --> 00:19:22,766 A:middle
where I have a navigation
gallery controller,

482
00:19:23,146 --> 00:19:25,586 A:middle
it's right here and I
immediately spot my mistake.

483
00:19:25,586 --> 00:19:28,176 A:middle
I was expecting to pass an
object that had gallery data

484
00:19:28,176 --> 00:19:30,796 A:middle
as a property, instead I'm just
passing gallery data directly.

485
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:31,776 A:middle
Let's fix that real quick.

486
00:19:32,306 --> 00:19:35,426 A:middle
I can use the convenient
ES6 shorthand syntax

487
00:19:35,426 --> 00:19:36,986 A:middle
for declaring a new
object that's going

488
00:19:36,986 --> 00:19:39,476 A:middle
to have both the property
name as gallery data

489
00:19:39,476 --> 00:19:44,096 A:middle
and also the value as
gallery data's value.

490
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:44,926 A:middle
I made that change.

491
00:19:44,926 --> 00:19:46,056 A:middle
When I'm editing local files

492
00:19:46,056 --> 00:19:49,566 A:middle
in Web Inspector I can
save those changes directly

493
00:19:49,726 --> 00:19:51,866 A:middle
and Web Inspector will prompt me
just to make sure I really want

494
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:54,706 A:middle
to over ride a local file and
of course, I do in this case.

495
00:19:55,146 --> 00:19:57,596 A:middle
Once you do that once for a
file, it'll never ask you again,

496
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:58,546 A:middle
it'll just save directly.

497
00:19:59,036 --> 00:20:00,686 A:middle
Let me reload, and
see if that worked.

500
00:19:59,036 --> 00:20:00,686 A:middle
Let me reload, and
see if that worked.

501
00:20:01,756 --> 00:20:03,786 A:middle
There we go, so now I have
my beautiful photography

502
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,226 A:middle
that I totally took myself.

503
00:20:05,226 --> 00:20:06,736 A:middle
This is looking really great.

504
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:11,046 A:middle
You can see that I have these
galleries, I've laid them

505
00:20:11,046 --> 00:20:13,206 A:middle
out so they take up the
full width of the display,

506
00:20:13,206 --> 00:20:16,086 A:middle
I can hover over them to see
the name of the galleries

507
00:20:16,086 --> 00:20:19,086 A:middle
and I also have this logo in
the middle I can hover over that

508
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:21,466 A:middle
to see a menu that comes out
to the side and you'll notice

509
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:23,816 A:middle
that occasionally these
galleries rotate between photos

510
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,696 A:middle
and I have a nice
dissolve effect to go

511
00:20:25,696 --> 00:20:26,536 A:middle
from one to the other.

512
00:20:26,636 --> 00:20:30,736 A:middle
I want to make sure that
this transition is as smooth

513
00:20:30,736 --> 00:20:34,546 A:middle
and as efficient as possible so
hopefully some of these tools

514
00:20:34,546 --> 00:20:36,406 A:middle
that Jono told us about
will help me do that.

515
00:20:36,716 --> 00:20:38,536 A:middle
The first thing I
want to do is I want

516
00:20:38,536 --> 00:20:39,456 A:middle
to turn on paint flashing.

517
00:20:39,456 --> 00:20:41,256 A:middle
I'm going to go to
the elements tab

518
00:20:41,656 --> 00:20:45,046 A:middle
and the paintbrush tab is
here, I'll select that.

519
00:20:45,906 --> 00:20:47,976 A:middle
Now you can see the
red rectangles

520
00:20:47,976 --> 00:20:50,406 A:middle
as the images transition
from one image to the next.

521
00:20:50,406 --> 00:20:52,256 A:middle
The first thing I'm noticing
is that for the duration

522
00:20:52,256 --> 00:20:54,426 A:middle
of that transition, I see
a solid red rectangle,

523
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,766 A:middle
that indicates to me that I'm
probably painting every single

524
00:20:57,766 --> 00:20:58,826 A:middle
frame of the transition.

525
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:01,856 A:middle
Now, I wonder if
that's too expensive?

526

527
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

528
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:01,856 A:middle
Now, I wonder if
that's too expensive?

529
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,916 A:middle
What I'd like to use
is use the I want

530
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,736 A:middle
to use the frames timeline

531
00:21:05,736 --> 00:21:08,806 A:middle
to tell me whether I'm
doing too much work

532
00:21:08,806 --> 00:21:10,876 A:middle
and maybe blowing my budget

533
00:21:10,876 --> 00:21:12,656 A:middle
for a 60 frames per
second animation.

534
00:21:12,696 --> 00:21:14,286 A:middle
I can switch to the
timelines tab.

535
00:21:15,336 --> 00:21:18,436 A:middle
And I can see that when I
reloaded it automatically

536
00:21:18,466 --> 00:21:21,246 A:middle
recorded a timeline for me so
I don't need to do that again.

537
00:21:21,596 --> 00:21:23,956 A:middle
For the most part, you know,
this is looking really good.

538
00:21:23,956 --> 00:21:26,806 A:middle
It's looking like I'm staying
within 60 frames per second.

539
00:21:26,806 --> 00:21:29,406 A:middle
But there were some frames
here that exceeded my budget

540
00:21:29,406 --> 00:21:30,326 A:middle
like this one right here.

541
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:33,066 A:middle
I can click and drag to
select a subset of this

542
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:36,566 A:middle
and then you can see that
it filters the records tab

543
00:21:36,656 --> 00:21:37,896 A:middle
to just include that subset.

544
00:21:38,206 --> 00:21:42,326 A:middle
I can expand some of these and
see the work that was done,

545
00:21:42,326 --> 00:21:44,136 A:middle
style and validation,
recalculation,

546
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:48,006 A:middle
time refiring, things like that.

547
00:21:49,386 --> 00:21:50,926 A:middle
Here's one that's interesting.

548
00:21:51,596 --> 00:21:53,846 A:middle
It's telling me that an
animation frame is fired based

549
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:56,856 A:middle
on request animation
frame, it's even telling me

550
00:21:56,856 --> 00:21:58,826 A:middle
that I've invalidated
a style and it's going

551
00:21:58,826 --> 00:22:01,046 A:middle
to let me jump right
to that line that did

552

553
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

554
00:21:58,826 --> 00:22:01,046 A:middle
to let me jump right
to that line that did

555
00:22:01,046 --> 00:22:02,176 A:middle
that style invalidation.

556
00:22:02,276 --> 00:22:03,946 A:middle
That's right here.

557
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:09,336 A:middle
In fact, the way this animation
is working is I'm using request

558
00:22:09,336 --> 00:22:13,046 A:middle
animation frame and each frame
I'm running with a duration

559
00:22:13,046 --> 00:22:16,276 A:middle
of one second, I can even pause
here and inspect these values.

560
00:22:16,706 --> 00:22:18,196 A:middle
Running for a duration
of one second

561
00:22:18,196 --> 00:22:20,976 A:middle
and I'm just animating the
opacity value from zero to one

562
00:22:21,026 --> 00:22:23,596 A:middle
over that duration
of one second.

563
00:22:23,596 --> 00:22:25,386 A:middle
It looks like, at
least in some cases,

564
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:28,086 A:middle
this animation is
too expensive to stay

565
00:22:28,086 --> 00:22:29,956 A:middle
within my 60 frames
per second budget.

566
00:22:30,326 --> 00:22:32,316 A:middle
I've actually been
planning to transition this

567
00:22:32,316 --> 00:22:33,446 A:middle
to a CSS transition instead

568
00:22:33,446 --> 00:22:34,686 A:middle
which I think might
be more efficient.

569
00:22:35,016 --> 00:22:38,406 A:middle
Let's do that and see if
things get a little better.

570
00:22:38,406 --> 00:22:39,456 A:middle
I'll select this.

571
00:22:39,456 --> 00:22:45,146 A:middle
I still want to set this
current class on the image

572
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:46,116 A:middle
and I'll talk about that later.

573
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:48,296 A:middle
I want to comment
out the rest of this.

574
00:22:48,296 --> 00:22:50,696 A:middle
I can save that local resource.

575
00:22:50,696 --> 00:22:52,446 A:middle
I'll confirm that.

576
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:56,756 A:middle
Let's go to the elements
tab and I can use the picker

577
00:22:56,756 --> 00:22:57,836 A:middle
to select one of
these galleries.

578
00:22:57,836 --> 00:22:58,606 A:middle
I'll choose this one.

579
00:22:59,426 --> 00:23:02,116 A:middle
Down here we can see that
there are three images

580

581
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

582
00:22:59,426 --> 00:23:02,116 A:middle
Down here we can see that
there are three images

583
00:23:02,116 --> 00:23:03,496 A:middle
that are stacked on
top of each other.

584
00:23:03,776 --> 00:23:05,966 A:middle
The one with the
current class right here,

585
00:23:05,966 --> 00:23:08,586 A:middle
is the one that's
currently being displayed.

586
00:23:09,386 --> 00:23:12,346 A:middle
In the side-bar I can actually
see what style properties

587
00:23:12,346 --> 00:23:13,186 A:middle
that current class has.

588
00:23:13,186 --> 00:23:15,306 A:middle
Right now it is Z index 3.

589
00:23:16,006 --> 00:23:18,686 A:middle
Let's add some more
properties here.

590
00:23:18,686 --> 00:23:20,746 A:middle
For one I want to
animate its opacity --

591
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,946 A:middle
or I want to set its
opacity to one then I want

592
00:23:22,946 --> 00:23:26,066 A:middle
to use a transition
to animate opacity

593
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:29,346 A:middle
over one second using a
linear animation curve.

594
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:32,836 A:middle
I'm going to make those changes.

595
00:23:32,836 --> 00:23:44,636 A:middle
I'm going to save again and
I'm going to reload the page.

596
00:23:44,846 --> 00:23:47,186 A:middle
Great. Right away you can see

597
00:23:47,186 --> 00:23:49,306 A:middle
that there is almost no
flashing going on here.

598
00:23:49,306 --> 00:23:51,446 A:middle
There is an occasional flash
in the beginning and the end,

599
00:23:51,746 --> 00:23:53,756 A:middle
but for the rest of the time
there is no flashing whatsoever.

600
00:23:53,756 --> 00:23:56,606 A:middle
That indicates I've gone from
doing software compositing

601
00:23:56,606 --> 00:24:00,026 A:middle
in my request animation frame
code to letting the engine do --

602

603
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

604
00:23:56,606 --> 00:24:00,026 A:middle
in my request animation frame
code to letting the engine do --

605
00:24:00,026 --> 00:24:03,836 A:middle
to composite the opacity
and hardware which is going

606
00:24:03,836 --> 00:24:05,816 A:middle
to be a much faster,
smoother experience.

607
00:24:06,286 --> 00:24:09,056 A:middle
This is looking pretty good but
I'm actually seeing a problem.

608
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:12,256 A:middle
I did see one frame animate but
then none of the others did.

609
00:24:12,476 --> 00:24:15,346 A:middle
It looks like I might have
introduced some sort of bug.

610
00:24:15,406 --> 00:24:18,036 A:middle
Let's see if we can
figure out what that is.

611
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:21,756 A:middle
I happen to know that
in my code I am --

612
00:24:22,676 --> 00:24:25,946 A:middle
that there's show
next image right here.

613
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,896 A:middle
Show next image returns
a promise --

614
00:24:28,706 --> 00:24:33,406 A:middle
let me reload so we can
actually hit my break point.

615
00:24:33,576 --> 00:24:36,166 A:middle
Show next image is going
to return a promise,

616
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:39,186 A:middle
when the promise is
resolved I'm start a timeout

617
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:40,486 A:middle
for the next animation.

618
00:24:40,776 --> 00:24:44,926 A:middle
We can even log the promise
here, show next image

619
00:24:45,096 --> 00:24:48,236 A:middle
and it is going to tell me
that the state is pending.

620
00:24:48,376 --> 00:24:49,986 A:middle
This may not be surprising
that it is pending

621
00:24:49,986 --> 00:24:51,126 A:middle
because I'm pausing
the debugger,

622
00:24:51,126 --> 00:24:53,406 A:middle
I might not have let the code
that will eventually resolve

623
00:24:53,406 --> 00:24:55,826 A:middle
that promise run, so
let me resume here.

624
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,596 A:middle
These start animating
every 2 seconds,

625
00:24:59,596 --> 00:25:01,326 A:middle
and so by now this
promise should be resolved

626

627
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

628
00:24:59,596 --> 00:25:01,326 A:middle
and so by now this
promise should be resolved

629
00:25:01,326 --> 00:25:02,346 A:middle
if everything is
working correctly.

630
00:25:02,566 --> 00:25:04,106 A:middle
Even though I'm no longer
pausing that function,

631
00:25:04,106 --> 00:25:06,026 A:middle
I still have that promise
bound to dollar sign 1

632
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:07,796 A:middle
so I can just inspect it again.

633
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:09,456 A:middle
I can see that it's
still pending.

634
00:25:09,606 --> 00:25:12,386 A:middle
I actually think I know
the mistake I made.

635
00:25:12,776 --> 00:25:15,946 A:middle
I'm going to go back
to my animation frame

636
00:25:16,446 --> 00:25:19,176 A:middle
and I can see here that I was
resolving the promise at the end

637
00:25:19,176 --> 00:25:20,506 A:middle
of the request animation frame.

638
00:25:20,796 --> 00:25:23,396 A:middle
The last animation
frame but I'm not doing

639
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,566 A:middle
that with the CSS transition.

640
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:25,666 A:middle
Let me just fix that real quick.

641
00:25:26,226 --> 00:25:32,366 A:middle
I'll use an on transition end
listener and resolve that.

642
00:25:33,296 --> 00:25:36,406 A:middle
Let me save that
change and reload.

643
00:25:40,176 --> 00:25:42,086 A:middle
And of course I hit
my brake point again.

644
00:25:42,146 --> 00:25:46,566 A:middle
So let me reload again.

645
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:50,136 A:middle
Great. Now we see these
smooth hardware accelerated

646
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:53,616 A:middle
transitions, everything
seems to be looking great.

647
00:25:53,616 --> 00:25:57,106 A:middle
We can see how we can use
these powerful features

648
00:25:57,106 --> 00:25:59,786 A:middle
like type profiling,
paint flashing,

649
00:25:59,786 --> 00:26:01,826 A:middle
Rendering Frames
timeline, improved console,

650

651
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

652
00:25:59,786 --> 00:26:01,826 A:middle
Rendering Frames
timeline, improved console,

653
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:04,936 A:middle
improved debugging to
quickly identify our issues

654
00:26:04,936 --> 00:26:05,516 A:middle
and fix them.

655
00:26:05,996 --> 00:26:07,536 A:middle
Thank you, and back to Jono.

656
00:26:08,516 --> 00:26:13,546 A:middle
[Applause]

657
00:26:14,046 --> 00:26:15,076 A:middle
>> JONO WELLS: Thank you, Andy.

658
00:26:15,716 --> 00:26:20,686 A:middle
So I think you're going
to find really great use

659
00:26:20,686 --> 00:26:21,396 A:middle
out of this tool.

660
00:26:23,086 --> 00:26:25,736 A:middle
You're going to want to take the
new features in Web Inspector,

661
00:26:25,736 --> 00:26:28,526 A:middle
make your site faster, use
the paint flashing tool,

662
00:26:29,226 --> 00:26:31,686 A:middle
use the rendering frames
timeline and try this in iOS,

663
00:26:31,686 --> 00:26:33,946 A:middle
this works of course, if
you're connected to a web view,

664
00:26:34,046 --> 00:26:36,866 A:middle
or Safari on iOS, you
should really try this out.

665
00:26:37,186 --> 00:26:40,506 A:middle
Performance is particularly
critical on those devices.

666
00:26:41,966 --> 00:26:43,116 A:middle
Make your code better.

667
00:26:43,406 --> 00:26:47,096 A:middle
Use the type profiler to get
a lot of great information,

668
00:26:47,156 --> 00:26:49,616 A:middle
play with the console, play
around with native APIs.

669
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,736 A:middle
Right. Use these to work
smarter and to work faster.

670
00:26:54,306 --> 00:26:57,566 A:middle
That's what we have
introduced with Web Inspector.

671
00:26:57,566 --> 00:27:00,956 A:middle
Now let's go ahead and
talk about a new tool.

672

673
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

674
00:26:57,566 --> 00:27:00,956 A:middle
Now let's go ahead and
talk about a new tool.

675
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:03,236 A:middle
It is called Responsive
Design Mode.

676
00:27:03,236 --> 00:27:05,286 A:middle
It is new in this
release of Safari 9

677
00:27:05,956 --> 00:27:09,366 A:middle
and we'll show you what
it is in just a moment.

678
00:27:09,536 --> 00:27:12,366 A:middle
First I want to talk about
responsive design for a moment

679
00:27:12,366 --> 00:27:14,286 A:middle
and why it is particularly
important now.

680
00:27:14,286 --> 00:27:17,576 A:middle
I'm sure most of you know
what responsive design is,

681
00:27:18,116 --> 00:27:23,006 A:middle
it is making sure that your
content will automatically fit

682
00:27:23,006 --> 00:27:26,356 A:middle
and give a great experience
for any screen size.

683
00:27:26,956 --> 00:27:29,046 A:middle
It is particularly important
that you do this correctly.

684
00:27:29,836 --> 00:27:33,856 A:middle
Now, up until this point some
of you may have said, well,

685
00:27:33,856 --> 00:27:38,416 A:middle
I can just, you know, sniff the
user agent string, I can figure

686
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:39,816 A:middle
out what kind of device I'm on.

687
00:27:40,036 --> 00:27:42,256 A:middle
I know that I'm running a
web view inside of an app,

688
00:27:42,256 --> 00:27:44,156 A:middle
I know exactly what
devices I'm targeting.

689
00:27:44,466 --> 00:27:45,196 A:middle
So I don't really need

690
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:49,446 A:middle
to do responsive design
the way it was meant to be.

691
00:27:49,686 --> 00:27:51,856 A:middle
We've made that a bit
trickier for you now

692
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:56,056 A:middle
because of multitasking.

693
00:27:56,056 --> 00:27:58,956 A:middle
Now web views might be resizing,

694
00:27:58,956 --> 00:28:01,876 A:middle
you don't exactly know how
wide they're going to be

695

696
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

697
00:27:58,956 --> 00:28:01,876 A:middle
you don't exactly know how
wide they're going to be

698
00:28:01,876 --> 00:28:07,966 A:middle
and they're going to be resizing
without reloading your content.

699
00:28:08,786 --> 00:28:12,146 A:middle
Right. We want to instead
of targeting a device,

700
00:28:12,396 --> 00:28:14,996 A:middle
we want to make sure we're
using features like @supports,

701
00:28:15,256 --> 00:28:17,746 A:middle
media queries, source set,

702
00:28:17,926 --> 00:28:22,876 A:middle
serving different pixel
resolution images to your users,

703
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:25,356 A:middle
we want to make sure that
our content will stretch

704
00:28:25,356 --> 00:28:26,626 A:middle
to any screen.

705
00:28:26,816 --> 00:28:29,246 A:middle
To help you do that
without having to go,

706
00:28:29,246 --> 00:28:32,116 A:middle
and open up the iOS simulator
and play around, we have brought

707
00:28:32,116 --> 00:28:35,366 A:middle
to you a new tool that going
to help you test your layouts

708
00:28:35,366 --> 00:28:38,696 A:middle
and just make sure that
they're properly responsive

709
00:28:38,696 --> 00:28:40,966 A:middle
and give you some ways
to test them in the sizes

710
00:28:40,966 --> 00:28:42,176 A:middle
for our devices as well.

711
00:28:42,356 --> 00:28:43,706 A:middle
That's Responsive Design Mode.

712
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:47,786 A:middle
You can find it in the develop
menu and when you turn it on,

713
00:28:47,786 --> 00:28:50,686 A:middle
your content will
shrink to this view.

714
00:28:51,536 --> 00:28:52,826 A:middle
This is Responsive Design Mode.

715
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,526 A:middle
It has a few interesting
features and the first one,

716
00:28:55,726 --> 00:28:58,916 A:middle
we have handles on the side so
you can stretch your content

717
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:01,116 A:middle
as small or as big
as you want to.

718

719
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

720
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:01,116 A:middle
as small or as big
as you want to.

721
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:05,596 A:middle
It will actually automatically
scale so if you want

722
00:29:05,816 --> 00:29:07,156 A:middle
to simulate your content

723
00:29:07,306 --> 00:29:11,476 A:middle
on a giant 70-inch display
let's say, you can do that.

724
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:18,466 A:middle
We also built in navigation with
presets for all of our devices

725
00:29:18,546 --> 00:29:21,966 A:middle
so that you can automatically
set it to different screens.

726
00:29:21,966 --> 00:29:24,826 A:middle
We actually have built in all
the multitasking configurations

727
00:29:24,826 --> 00:29:28,676 A:middle
in here as well, as you
will see in a moment.

728
00:29:28,676 --> 00:29:31,936 A:middle
For the iPads that are up there,
you can click, it will show you,

729
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,776 A:middle
it'll automatically
resize your content

730
00:29:33,956 --> 00:29:37,356 A:middle
to those configurations
We also allow you to test

731
00:29:37,356 --> 00:29:40,506 A:middle
to make sure you're covering
1X, 2X, and 3X images.

732
00:29:42,106 --> 00:29:44,116 A:middle
Additionally, we
do give you a tool

733
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,906 A:middle
to set the user agent string
because you might need

734
00:29:46,906 --> 00:29:49,666 A:middle
to support a very old
browser, legacy browser

735
00:29:49,846 --> 00:29:52,986 A:middle
and make sure you get away
from using user agent strings

736
00:29:53,196 --> 00:29:56,586 A:middle
to target the different screens
that your concept will run on.

737
00:29:57,136 --> 00:29:58,366 A:middle
Right. To be forward thinking.

738
00:29:58,576 --> 00:29:59,736 A:middle
This tool will help
you make sure

739
00:29:59,736 --> 00:30:01,286 A:middle
that you don't break anything

740

741
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

742
00:29:59,736 --> 00:30:01,286 A:middle
that you don't break anything

743
00:30:01,286 --> 00:30:03,396 A:middle
when the user agent string
changes and make sure

744
00:30:03,396 --> 00:30:05,456 A:middle
that you have properly gotten
away from that as well.

745
00:30:06,246 --> 00:30:08,716 A:middle
Now to show you this tool in
action and how it can be useful,

746
00:30:08,716 --> 00:30:11,106 A:middle
I would like to bring
Andy back up to the stage

747
00:30:11,286 --> 00:30:13,346 A:middle
to take his site a
little bit further.

748
00:30:13,386 --> 00:30:13,666 A:middle
Andy.

749
00:30:14,516 --> 00:30:17,806 A:middle
[Applause]

750
00:30:18,306 --> 00:30:19,046 A:middle
>> ANDY ESTES: Thank
you, again, Jono.

751
00:30:20,086 --> 00:30:22,436 A:middle
Let's just jump right in
to Responsive Design Mode.

752
00:30:26,256 --> 00:30:27,756 A:middle
Here we are.

753
00:30:27,756 --> 00:30:31,206 A:middle
I currently have a preset
set for the iPad mini 3.

754
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:34,096 A:middle
Let's also explore some
of these desktop sizes.

755
00:30:34,096 --> 00:30:36,196 A:middle
One of the great things about
this is I can actually size it

756
00:30:36,616 --> 00:30:38,396 A:middle
to a resolution larger
than my monitor.

757
00:30:38,716 --> 00:30:43,446 A:middle
Right now you can see that I
have a width of 2536 pixels

758
00:30:43,446 --> 00:30:45,126 A:middle
which is definitely
larger than this monitor.

759
00:30:45,126 --> 00:30:48,836 A:middle
So that's useful, but I already
knew that my site looked good

760
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:50,966 A:middle
on desktop Viewport sizes.

761
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,386 A:middle
I want to make sure that
everything works well

762
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:56,966 A:middle
on iOS devices as well, iPhones
and iPads, I can click these

763
00:30:56,966 --> 00:30:57,966 A:middle
and quickly cycle through,

764
00:30:57,966 --> 00:31:00,166 A:middle
here is an iPad error
in landscape mode.

765

766
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

767
00:30:57,966 --> 00:31:00,166 A:middle
here is an iPad error
in landscape mode.

768
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:03,026 A:middle
Here are some of the
multitasking modes.

769
00:31:03,206 --> 00:31:07,796 A:middle
If I keep going it'll rotate
to portrait and I can also look

770
00:31:07,796 --> 00:31:08,996 A:middle
at the multitasking modes there.

771
00:31:09,356 --> 00:31:11,026 A:middle
I'm starting to notice
that in some

772
00:31:11,026 --> 00:31:13,916 A:middle
of these configurations
my site --

773
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:16,456 A:middle
the Viewport is really
too narrow to be useful.

774
00:31:16,756 --> 00:31:18,846 A:middle
For example, I really can't
see much of these photos

775
00:31:18,846 --> 00:31:20,976 A:middle
if I rollover this menu,
the text is clipped.

776
00:31:20,976 --> 00:31:22,956 A:middle
This isn't a really
good experience.

777
00:31:22,956 --> 00:31:25,236 A:middle
Let's see if I can make
some changes to make this --

778
00:31:25,236 --> 00:31:28,736 A:middle
make my site more responsive
at these types of Viewports.

779
00:31:28,776 --> 00:31:30,656 A:middle
I'm going to bring the Web
Inspector back up again.

780
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:31,986 A:middle
One of the great things
about this tool is

781
00:31:31,986 --> 00:31:33,646 A:middle
that you can use the
Inspector in conjunction

782
00:31:34,106 --> 00:31:35,226 A:middle
with Responsive Design Mode.

783
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,176 A:middle
Let's dock it on the side

784
00:31:36,596 --> 00:31:38,386 A:middle
so that I have more
screen real estate here.

785
00:31:39,146 --> 00:31:40,556 A:middle
Let's turn off the
paint flashing

786
00:31:41,236 --> 00:31:45,056 A:middle
which is annoying at this point.

787
00:31:45,056 --> 00:31:46,476 A:middle
Let's do a few quick changes.

788
00:31:46,476 --> 00:31:48,496 A:middle
First off, let's get rid
of this logo in the middle

789
00:31:48,496 --> 00:31:51,136 A:middle
since the menu doesn't
have room to fit,

790
00:31:51,136 --> 00:31:52,656 A:middle
I don't think it's
worth displaying

791
00:31:52,656 --> 00:31:57,666 A:middle
and I also show the names of the
galleries on hover so let's set

792
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:58,736 A:middle
that to display non-grade.

793
00:31:58,736 --> 00:32:01,046 A:middle
In terms of these images,

794

795
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

796
00:31:58,736 --> 00:32:01,046 A:middle
In terms of these images,

797
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:03,176 A:middle
I have so little screen real
estate I'd really like them

798
00:32:03,176 --> 00:32:05,816 A:middle
to take up the entire Viewport.

799
00:32:05,876 --> 00:32:09,806 A:middle
Right now I'm specifying
that they are using 50%

800
00:32:09,806 --> 00:32:12,136 A:middle
of the Viewport width and
height, let's make that 100.

801
00:32:12,656 --> 00:32:18,716 A:middle
Great. So now I have just
one gallery per screen

802
00:32:18,716 --> 00:32:19,536 A:middle
which is really nice.

803
00:32:19,536 --> 00:32:22,416 A:middle
Now you'll notice I have these
hover effects which works great

804
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:24,766 A:middle
on a desktop but on iOS
devices you won't have hover

805
00:32:25,086 --> 00:32:26,786 A:middle
and I also don't have my
menu it would be great

806
00:32:26,786 --> 00:32:28,186 A:middle
if this text is just
always there.

807
00:32:28,586 --> 00:32:30,476 A:middle
Let's explore doing that.

808
00:32:30,846 --> 00:32:35,086 A:middle
I'm going to enable the
hover pseudo class here.

809
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:36,646 A:middle
You see that it displayed.

810
00:32:36,946 --> 00:32:38,426 A:middle
There are a few things
that happen on hover.

811
00:32:38,426 --> 00:32:41,936 A:middle
The first is that the
UI is capacity one,

812
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:43,566 A:middle
but let's just make
that always happen.

813
00:32:44,666 --> 00:32:47,126 A:middle
Second, you will notice
there is an overlay

814
00:32:47,126 --> 00:32:49,426 A:middle
that goes to opacity 0.

815
00:32:49,806 --> 00:32:52,456 A:middle
Let's just make it
always opacity 0.

816
00:32:52,456 --> 00:32:58,426 A:middle
I have my labels all the
time which is what I want.

817
00:32:58,786 --> 00:33:01,506 A:middle
One more change I want to
make, I went to the What's New

818

819
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

820
00:32:58,786 --> 00:33:01,506 A:middle
One more change I want to
make, I went to the What's New

821
00:33:01,506 --> 00:33:03,396 A:middle
in WebKit session
yesterday and I learned

822
00:33:03,396 --> 00:33:05,306 A:middle
about this new feature
called Scroll Snap Points,

823
00:33:05,306 --> 00:33:07,916 A:middle
and I would love it if as I
scroll through the galleries

824
00:33:07,966 --> 00:33:11,976 A:middle
if it snapped exactly
to each gallery.

825
00:33:12,236 --> 00:33:14,396 A:middle
I'll try to add that real
quick, I'm going to the body tag

826
00:33:15,006 --> 00:33:20,936 A:middle
and I'll do a WebKit scroll
snap type, make it mandatory

827
00:33:21,206 --> 00:33:24,426 A:middle
and then I'll do WebKit
scroll snap points

828
00:33:24,426 --> 00:33:27,776 A:middle
and in the wide direction
I'll repeat every Viewport.

829
00:33:29,506 --> 00:33:30,646 A:middle
Let's look at that.

830
00:33:31,866 --> 00:33:33,546 A:middle
Perfect. Beautiful,
it just snaps right

831
00:33:33,546 --> 00:33:34,376 A:middle
into place as I scroll.

832
00:33:34,376 --> 00:33:35,526 A:middle
I really like that.

833
00:33:36,006 --> 00:33:38,186 A:middle
There is a number of other
changes that I have decided

834
00:33:38,186 --> 00:33:40,896 A:middle
to make, and I have actually
baked these into a media query

835
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,316 A:middle
that I've added right here.

836
00:33:42,786 --> 00:33:47,966 A:middle
I'll just uncomment that and
save it then reload my site.

837
00:33:48,656 --> 00:33:50,686 A:middle
You can see I added a little
text scroll to see more

838
00:33:50,686 --> 00:33:51,616 A:middle
at the bottom, which is nice.

839
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,056 A:middle
I moved my icon to
the upper right,

840
00:33:53,056 --> 00:33:54,086 A:middle
it doesn't bring up a menu.

841
00:33:54,486 --> 00:33:56,366 A:middle
And now with these settings --

842
00:33:56,366 --> 00:33:58,806 A:middle
this is looking good
at this Viewport,

843
00:33:58,806 --> 00:34:01,256 A:middle
let's make sure things work
well at other Viewports.

844

845
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

846
00:33:58,806 --> 00:34:01,256 A:middle
let's make sure things work
well at other Viewports.

847
00:34:01,296 --> 00:34:03,926 A:middle
If I go to the wider size, I
still get my original design,

848
00:34:04,266 --> 00:34:05,796 A:middle
and then as I go down
to smaller sizes,

849
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:09,275 A:middle
I see the narrow Viewport
responsive design.

850
00:34:09,335 --> 00:34:10,266 A:middle
This is great.

851
00:34:10,266 --> 00:34:13,275 A:middle
It is really easy to use
this tool in conjunction

852
00:34:13,275 --> 00:34:15,466 A:middle
with the Web Inspector to
see how your contents look

853
00:34:15,466 --> 00:34:16,576 A:middle
at different Viewport sizes

854
00:34:16,856 --> 00:34:19,656 A:middle
and make quick changes
to effect the design.

855
00:34:20,036 --> 00:34:21,326 A:middle
Thank you, and back to Jono.

856
00:34:22,516 --> 00:34:28,956 A:middle
[Applause]

857
00:34:29,456 --> 00:34:30,806 A:middle
>> JONO WELLS: All right.

858
00:34:31,295 --> 00:34:35,186 A:middle
Andy, thank you for
showing us that.

859
00:34:35,545 --> 00:34:36,926 A:middle
That's Responsive Design Mode.

860
00:34:37,496 --> 00:34:43,686 A:middle
If you're not doing responsive
design for the content

861
00:34:43,686 --> 00:34:45,616 A:middle
of your applications or
for your web content,

862
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:46,775 A:middle
now is the time to start.

863
00:34:47,226 --> 00:34:50,386 A:middle
It is a good idea
because, again,

864
00:34:50,485 --> 00:34:52,735 A:middle
something like multitasking
just come out of nowhere just

865
00:34:52,735 --> 00:34:54,446 A:middle
like that and mess
your content up.

866
00:34:54,446 --> 00:34:56,096 A:middle
You don't want that to happen.

867
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:57,506 A:middle
We have added Responsive
Design Mode.

868
00:34:57,506 --> 00:35:01,686 A:middle
The focus is on layout, image
resolution and being able

869

870
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

871
00:34:57,506 --> 00:35:01,686 A:middle
The focus is on layout, image
resolution and being able

872
00:35:01,686 --> 00:35:05,356 A:middle
to stay focused in Safari
in the Development Tools

873
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:09,466 A:middle
so you don't have to leave and
go off to simulator or a plug-in

874
00:35:09,466 --> 00:35:11,526 A:middle
of an actual device
to test your layouts.

875
00:35:11,936 --> 00:35:14,136 A:middle
We have all the presets
for the devices we make,

876
00:35:14,136 --> 00:35:16,076 A:middle
you can set your own
presets as you saw,

877
00:35:16,506 --> 00:35:19,046 A:middle
it works right alongside Web
Inspector so you can debug

878
00:35:19,046 --> 00:35:20,056 A:middle
as you normally would.

879
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:22,146 A:middle
This is new in Safari 9.

880
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:24,446 A:middle
It is a really cool tool.

881
00:35:24,586 --> 00:35:28,396 A:middle
Try it out.

882
00:35:30,556 --> 00:35:35,536 A:middle
Along with Web Inspector you
now have a very powerful set

883
00:35:35,536 --> 00:35:39,566 A:middle
of tools to take your designs,
make them smooth, feel great,

884
00:35:39,676 --> 00:35:41,766 A:middle
make sure that they're
error free and make sure

885
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,966 A:middle
that they work across
different screen sizes.

886
00:35:45,646 --> 00:35:52,166 A:middle
When you leave here please
-- first of all, get OS X,

887
00:35:52,256 --> 00:35:54,326 A:middle
El Capitan, get the
developer release,

888
00:35:54,616 --> 00:35:55,786 A:middle
if you don't have it already,

889
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:57,566 A:middle
turn on the develop
menu in Safari.

890
00:35:59,236 --> 00:36:02,656 A:middle
Customize Web Inspector to your
liking, play with the interface,

891

892
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

893
00:35:59,236 --> 00:36:02,656 A:middle
Customize Web Inspector to your
liking, play with the interface,

894
00:36:02,656 --> 00:36:04,096 A:middle
because I think you're
really going to like it.

895
00:36:04,096 --> 00:36:06,676 A:middle
It is a lot cleaner, everything
is a lot easier to find.

896
00:36:07,136 --> 00:36:08,786 A:middle
Play around with paint flashing

897
00:36:08,786 --> 00:36:10,146 A:middle
and the rendering
frames timeline.

898
00:36:10,596 --> 00:36:12,786 A:middle
Even if you think that you
have the best performance

899
00:36:12,886 --> 00:36:15,676 A:middle
that web content has ever had in
the history of all web content,

900
00:36:16,516 --> 00:36:18,466 A:middle
this will tell you
something about your site

901
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,766 A:middle
and how it is working on WebKit,
how it's working in Safari,

902
00:36:22,336 --> 00:36:25,546 A:middle
right, and you might discover
something you didn't know.

903
00:36:26,556 --> 00:36:29,066 A:middle
Right. The second I use paint
flashing for the first time

904
00:36:29,066 --> 00:36:30,516 A:middle
for instance I had a site,

905
00:36:30,516 --> 00:36:32,376 A:middle
I discovered I had
some painting happening

906
00:36:32,376 --> 00:36:33,436 A:middle
in the background I didn't want

907
00:36:33,436 --> 00:36:35,796 A:middle
that was stuttering the
animation for everything else,

908
00:36:35,796 --> 00:36:36,896 A:middle
I was able to eliminate it.

909
00:36:37,136 --> 00:36:38,156 A:middle
It just happened immediately.

910
00:36:38,156 --> 00:36:38,686 A:middle
It was great.

911
00:36:39,356 --> 00:36:41,106 A:middle
Use the type information
profiler.

912
00:36:42,306 --> 00:36:44,386 A:middle
Right. Take -- we're going to --

913
00:36:44,386 --> 00:36:46,566 A:middle
this tool, it takes all
of the code, makes it look

914
00:36:46,566 --> 00:36:48,906 A:middle
like a light bright board if you
ever played with one of those.

915
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:51,176 A:middle
It's amazing, it's going to
give you great information.

916
00:36:51,446 --> 00:36:52,036 A:middle
Play with that.

917
00:36:52,156 --> 00:36:54,446 A:middle
Play in the console
with the object views,

918
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,306 A:middle
try Responsive Design Mode.

919
00:36:56,306 --> 00:37:02,746 A:middle
With all of these tools, use
them to make your content shine.

920

921
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

922
00:36:56,306 --> 00:37:02,746 A:middle
With all of these tools, use
them to make your content shine.

923
00:37:03,656 --> 00:37:08,006 A:middle
Now, it is really important
that we get feedback from you.

924
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,716 A:middle
We very much want your feedback
on these new tools and so

925
00:37:11,776 --> 00:37:18,566 A:middle
for that, you should send
questions or ideas to Jon Davis,

926
00:37:18,566 --> 00:37:20,136 A:middle
he's our web evangelist
and you can reach him

927
00:37:20,136 --> 00:37:22,596 A:middle
at web-evangelist@apple.com.

928
00:37:23,056 --> 00:37:26,756 A:middle
We also have these
resources here for information

929
00:37:26,756 --> 00:37:29,876 A:middle
on developing with Safari,
resources for Safari developers

930
00:37:29,876 --> 00:37:31,686 A:middle
and the Safari developer
library.

931
00:37:32,486 --> 00:37:35,176 A:middle
In the second link right now
there is a document called

932
00:37:35,176 --> 00:37:36,416 A:middle
What's New in Safari 9.

933
00:37:36,416 --> 00:37:37,266 A:middle
To learn more about
these features,

934
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:37,956 A:middle
plus all of the new features

935
00:37:37,986 --> 00:37:39,186 A:middle
on the platform itself
you'll definitely want

936
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:39,906 A:middle
to check out that document.

937
00:37:39,936 --> 00:37:41,436 A:middle
Also, we have two labs coming
up for Safari and WebKit,

938
00:37:41,466 --> 00:37:42,606 A:middle
we have win right after
this session and Andy

939
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:44,226 A:middle
and I will be there along with
many developers and engineers

940
00:37:44,256 --> 00:37:45,696 A:middle
on the Safari and WebKit team
to answer your questions.

941
00:37:45,726 --> 00:37:46,686 A:middle
There is another one
on Friday at noon.

942
00:37:46,716 --> 00:37:47,256 A:middle
Please come, check it out.

943
00:37:47,286 --> 00:37:48,516 A:middle
We'll answer questions,
get help for the content.

944
00:37:48,546 --> 00:37:49,656 A:middle
I hope you enjoy the
rest of your conference.

945
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:50,976 A:middle
Thank you very much for
being with us this morning.

946
00:37:51,516 --> 00:37:54,500 A:middle
[Applause]

947
