>> JULIAN MISSIG:
Hello, everyone.

3
00:00:42,236 --> 00:00:43,046 A:middle
I am Julian.

4
00:00:43,046 --> 00:00:45,196 A:middle
I brought along my
teammates, Joe and Marek.

5
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:47,496 A:middle
Welcome to Designing
with Animation.

6
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:54,756 A:middle
If you have an app or a
game, you've probably come

7
00:00:54,756 --> 00:00:57,376 A:middle
across the circumstance where
you want to tell someone

8
00:00:57,696 --> 00:00:58,896 A:middle
that something has happened.

9
00:00:59,596 --> 00:01:01,656 A:middle
Perhaps a new item is
added to this list.

10

11
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

12
00:00:59,596 --> 00:01:01,656 A:middle
Perhaps a new item is
added to this list.

13
00:01:02,426 --> 00:01:06,206 A:middle
You could do something
like this.

14
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:10,366 A:middle
Or perhaps you would like people

15
00:01:10,366 --> 00:01:14,586 A:middle
to understand how two different
parts of your app are related.

16
00:01:15,146 --> 00:01:18,636 A:middle
You could do something
like this ...

17
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:24,986 A:middle
Or maybe your app has a gesture
you've just introduced and you'd

18
00:01:24,986 --> 00:01:27,156 A:middle
like people to understand
how the gesture works.

19
00:01:28,216 --> 00:01:31,296 A:middle
You could do something
like this ...

20
00:01:31,956 --> 00:01:35,296 A:middle
Now, as you might suspect, given
the name of the talk today,

21
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:38,736 A:middle
there is another way to do this.

22
00:01:39,086 --> 00:01:42,506 A:middle
Today we're going to talk
about how you can use animation

23
00:01:43,016 --> 00:01:48,006 A:middle
to direct people's attention,
keep people oriented,

24
00:01:49,406 --> 00:01:52,806 A:middle
and connect people's behavior
to what's happening on screen.

25
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:56,136 A:middle
But before we get into that,

26
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,546 A:middle
just a little bit
about who we are.

27
00:01:58,176 --> 00:02:02,466 A:middle
We're a team of inventors,
designers, and prototypers.

28

29
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

30
00:01:58,176 --> 00:02:02,466 A:middle
We're a team of inventors,
designers, and prototypers.

31
00:02:03,776 --> 00:02:07,826 A:middle
We explore what new interfaces
mean for Apple's products,

32
00:02:08,406 --> 00:02:10,776 A:middle
including trackpad
gestures, Force Touch,

33
00:02:11,296 --> 00:02:14,226 A:middle
and the Taptic Engine.

34
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:19,846 A:middle
But we don't make full
working apps to do this.

35
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:23,396 A:middle
We make little animated
experiments

36
00:02:23,596 --> 00:02:24,756 A:middle
and interactive prototypes.

37
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:27,276 A:middle
Today we will talk a little
bit about what that means.

38
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:34,606 A:middle
So the plan for today is to
ease in to the what, why,

39
00:02:34,656 --> 00:02:38,826 A:middle
and how of animation;
to communicate an idea

40
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:44,026 A:middle
by animating it; and to learn a
little bit about how animation

41
00:02:44,106 --> 00:02:46,216 A:middle
and interaction are intertwined.

42
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,886 A:middle
So what is animation?

43
00:02:53,816 --> 00:02:58,886 A:middle
How do we think about animation
when we are making our apps?

44
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:03,866 A:middle
Well, at one point in time,
your app will have one screen,

45

46
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

47
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:03,866 A:middle
Well, at one point in time,
your app will have one screen,

48
00:03:05,126 --> 00:03:09,006 A:middle
and at some other point in time,
it will have some other screen.

49
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:13,926 A:middle
Because these two apps don't
exist at the exact same time,

50
00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:17,986 A:middle
there is going to be some
kind of change between them,

51
00:03:18,216 --> 00:03:19,816 A:middle
even if it's just an
instantaneous pop.

52
00:03:20,756 --> 00:03:22,706 A:middle
It's this change that
we are talking about,

53
00:03:22,706 --> 00:03:25,866 A:middle
this change over time, when
we think about animation.

54
00:03:27,436 --> 00:03:30,326 A:middle
Now, because humans usually
can't perceive instantaneous

55
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,996 A:middle
change unless you
are pretty special,

56
00:03:33,886 --> 00:03:36,966 A:middle
you can slowly change
things over time

57
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,696 A:middle
to communicate something
about how things are related.

58
00:03:41,116 --> 00:03:42,466 A:middle
So animation is change
over time.

59
00:03:43,876 --> 00:03:46,446 A:middle
But you'll note that when I
was talking about this change

60
00:03:46,446 --> 00:03:49,626 A:middle
over time, I already
had those two screens.

61
00:03:49,726 --> 00:03:52,196 A:middle
Animation isn't going to solve
all of your design problems.

62
00:03:52,196 --> 00:03:53,936 A:middle
You still need to go
out there and figure

63
00:03:53,936 --> 00:03:56,076 A:middle
out which screens
your app should have

64
00:03:56,116 --> 00:03:57,826 A:middle
and what should be on them.

65
00:03:59,696 --> 00:04:04,636 A:middle
But the manner of this change

66

67
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

68
00:03:59,696 --> 00:04:04,636 A:middle
But the manner of this change

69
00:04:04,636 --> 00:04:06,896 A:middle
over time can communicate
things.

70
00:04:08,386 --> 00:04:10,576 A:middle
Chances are your app has
more than just two screens.

71
00:04:11,106 --> 00:04:13,486 A:middle
In fact, it may have many,
many different screens.

72
00:04:15,016 --> 00:04:18,435 A:middle
And you can use a different type
of animation for the transition

73
00:04:18,435 --> 00:04:22,176 A:middle
between different types of
screens to communicate something

74
00:04:22,176 --> 00:04:24,216 A:middle
about how all the screens
relate to one another.

75
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:31,346 A:middle
So all this different change
over time communicates something

76
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:34,036 A:middle
about how all of the screens
in your app fit together.

77
00:04:34,606 --> 00:04:36,926 A:middle
This is a very practical way
of thinking about animation.

78
00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:38,396 A:middle
It's solving some
of these problems.

79
00:04:39,106 --> 00:04:42,896 A:middle
But there's another
thing to pay attention

80
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:46,646 A:middle
to when you are looking at the
manner of the change over time.

81
00:04:47,216 --> 00:04:51,306 A:middle
If we go back to that example
of adding a new item to a list,

82
00:04:52,506 --> 00:04:54,486 A:middle
you could animate a
new item in like this.

83
00:04:55,326 --> 00:04:59,156 A:middle
And this might be
appropriate for a game

84
00:04:59,186 --> 00:05:02,266 A:middle
if a new player has been added,
and this is a very rare event

85

86
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

87
00:04:59,186 --> 00:05:02,266 A:middle
if a new player has been added,
and this is a very rare event

88
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:03,636 A:middle
and you want to kind
of celebrate it.

89
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:07,386 A:middle
But for most apps, you
probably don't need to go

90
00:05:07,386 --> 00:05:08,606 A:middle
that far with your animation.

91
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:14,026 A:middle
You might be more familiar with
an animation kind of like this.

92
00:05:14,236 --> 00:05:16,996 A:middle
The point is both of these
animations are communicating

93
00:05:16,996 --> 00:05:19,936 A:middle
that a new item has been
added, but they do it

94
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:20,786 A:middle
in a different manner.

95
00:05:21,896 --> 00:05:24,566 A:middle
They communicate something
about your app's character.

96
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:27,776 A:middle
It's an artful way of thinking
about this change over time

97
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:31,306 A:middle
that tells you how
the app feels.

98
00:05:31,816 --> 00:05:35,406 A:middle
Especially as we start to look
at content front and center

99
00:05:35,406 --> 00:05:40,206 A:middle
in apps, the motion of this
content can be very powerful

100
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:48,546 A:middle
in communicating what your
app is and how it feels.

101
00:05:48,776 --> 00:05:50,216 A:middle
So why should we animate?

102
00:05:50,486 --> 00:05:55,306 A:middle
When do we decide to start
looking at animations?

103
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:58,166 A:middle
Well, there are probably a
lot of different reasons,

104
00:05:58,306 --> 00:06:01,346 A:middle
so today we are just going to
look at three main categories.

105

106
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

107
00:05:58,306 --> 00:06:01,346 A:middle
so today we are just going to
look at three main categories.

108
00:06:02,116 --> 00:06:06,776 A:middle
The first is to direct
people's attention.

109
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:09,766 A:middle
To help them become
aware that something

110
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:14,016 A:middle
within your app has changed.

111
00:06:14,426 --> 00:06:18,396 A:middle
Perhaps something behind the
scenes in your app has changed.

112
00:06:18,426 --> 00:06:19,816 A:middle
You want your users
to understand

113
00:06:19,816 --> 00:06:22,306 A:middle
that there's something
new that they can explore.

114
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:31,276 A:middle
Or perhaps your user has
performed some type of action.

115
00:06:32,376 --> 00:06:33,636 A:middle
Maybe you are going
to press and hold

116
00:06:33,636 --> 00:06:34,916 A:middle
on these icons for a little bit.

117
00:06:36,036 --> 00:06:40,586 A:middle
This animation is communicating
the result of the user's action.

118
00:06:40,796 --> 00:06:46,066 A:middle
By pressing and holding, I've
changed the state of the app.

119
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:48,286 A:middle
So directing attention
can be useful

120
00:06:48,346 --> 00:06:50,466 A:middle
for both of those scenarios.

121
00:06:54,256 --> 00:06:59,446 A:middle
The second reason to animate is
to help keep people oriented.

122
00:06:59,446 --> 00:07:03,666 A:middle
To help them understand where
they are within your app

123

124
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

125
00:06:59,446 --> 00:07:03,666 A:middle
To help them understand where
they are within your app

126
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:04,356 A:middle
and where they've been.

127
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:09,976 A:middle
So if we just take a look at
tapping on the Back button

128
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:16,526 A:middle
in Mail, for example, there's
an animation that happens.

129
00:07:16,696 --> 00:07:18,966 A:middle
And you can see that this
animation is communicating

130
00:07:18,966 --> 00:07:21,496 A:middle
something about these
screens almost being stacked

131
00:07:21,496 --> 00:07:22,456 A:middle
on top of one another.

132
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,946 A:middle
But if we slow it down
and really take a look

133
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,696 A:middle
at what's going on,
there's some subtlety

134
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:32,256 A:middle
to this animation that's
reinforcing what's happening

135
00:07:32,296 --> 00:07:33,286 A:middle
as the user is going back.

136
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:36,476 A:middle
So watch as I press
the Back button now.

137
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:40,446 A:middle
You can see that the label

138
00:07:40,506 --> 00:07:43,136 A:middle
from that button becomes
the new section header

139
00:07:43,486 --> 00:07:44,396 A:middle
for where I now am.

140
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:53,536 A:middle
It's subtle, but if you pay
attention to it, it's there.

141
00:07:53,746 --> 00:07:55,466 A:middle
The third reason to animate is

142
00:07:56,636 --> 00:07:58,996 A:middle
to help connect people's
behavior

143
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:00,776 A:middle
to what's happening on screen.

144

145
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

146
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:00,776 A:middle
to what's happening on screen.

147
00:08:02,126 --> 00:08:04,296 A:middle
We want people to
feel in control

148
00:08:04,296 --> 00:08:06,166 A:middle
of your app at all times.

149
00:08:08,276 --> 00:08:11,726 A:middle
If we look at Notification
Center as an example,

150
00:08:12,336 --> 00:08:17,926 A:middle
as I start controlling it, I can
actually see what's happening,

151
00:08:18,426 --> 00:08:21,286 A:middle
where my finger is, even
though you can't see my finger

152
00:08:21,286 --> 00:08:21,746 A:middle
in this video.

153
00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:27,796 A:middle
We can break this down
a little bit and think

154
00:08:27,796 --> 00:08:30,286 A:middle
about how we connect
people's behavior.

155
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:33,635 A:middle
I start going into
Notification Center

156
00:08:33,635 --> 00:08:36,956 A:middle
by touching the top
of the screen.

157
00:08:37,145 --> 00:08:42,765 A:middle
Then, as my finger moves, the
Notification Center is connected

158
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:43,966 A:middle
to my finger at all times.

159
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:47,456 A:middle
I can see what is happening
and what's going to happen.

160
00:08:47,456 --> 00:08:50,386 A:middle
I get a hint about
what's going to happen.

161
00:08:50,386 --> 00:08:53,356 A:middle
And then if I flick
back up or flick down,

162
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:56,376 A:middle
it will either cancel or
complete this gesture.

163
00:08:57,386 --> 00:08:59,636 A:middle
And the animation will
respond appropriately.

164

165
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

166
00:09:00,946 --> 00:09:04,426 A:middle
And perhaps even hint at how I
can reverse out of this mode.

167
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:07,896 A:middle
This helps you feel in control,

168
00:09:08,206 --> 00:09:10,506 A:middle
but it also tells you how
the gesture itself works.

169
00:09:11,386 --> 00:09:17,996 A:middle
So these are three reasons we
are going to talk about today.

170
00:09:19,546 --> 00:09:21,496 A:middle
But how do we try
out animations?

171
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:27,026 A:middle
Part of it is we want
to be able to understand

172
00:09:27,336 --> 00:09:29,216 A:middle
which animations we should use.

173
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:34,326 A:middle
As we're designing our
app, we start to draw a lot

174
00:09:34,326 --> 00:09:38,336 A:middle
of screenshots, but these
screenshots show you too little.

175
00:09:39,306 --> 00:09:42,516 A:middle
You can't actually understand
anything about the manner

176
00:09:42,926 --> 00:09:46,046 A:middle
in which you're transitioning
from one screen to another

177
00:09:46,046 --> 00:09:47,436 A:middle
if it's not moving at all.

178
00:09:48,446 --> 00:09:52,586 A:middle
So we could go and build
a real working app.

179
00:09:53,716 --> 00:09:55,446 A:middle
But apps actually
show you too much.

180
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,086 A:middle
There are a lot of
details involved

181
00:09:59,086 --> 00:10:02,366 A:middle
in building a full working
app that get in the way

182

183
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

184
00:09:59,086 --> 00:10:02,366 A:middle
in building a full working
app that get in the way

185
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:05,336 A:middle
of exploring many different
types of animation; right?

186
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:07,236 A:middle
We want to be able to
try a whole lot of things

187
00:10:07,286 --> 00:10:08,316 A:middle
to figure out what's right.

188
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:17,156 A:middle
So what we do is make
little animated experiments.

189
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:21,366 A:middle
We find ways that we can try
out many different animations

190
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:25,596 A:middle
because this allows us to
try built-in animations

191
00:10:25,956 --> 00:10:27,926 A:middle
and compare those to
custom animations.

192
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:30,606 A:middle
Maybe we have some brilliant
new idea for an animation,

193
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:32,146 A:middle
but we should still
compare it back

194
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:34,586 A:middle
to what the standard iOS
one would be to make sure

195
00:10:34,586 --> 00:10:37,426 A:middle
that our intuition that this
is brilliant is right; right?

196
00:10:37,426 --> 00:10:40,676 A:middle
We need to see both of them.

197
00:10:41,316 --> 00:10:42,286 A:middle
So really what we
are doing here,

198
00:10:42,286 --> 00:10:45,796 A:middle
we think of this as
making prototypes.

199
00:10:45,796 --> 00:10:46,986 A:middle
Even though it's not in code,

200
00:10:47,096 --> 00:10:49,496 A:middle
we are kind of making
little experiments.

201
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:51,356 A:middle
We are trying things
out that aren't real.

202
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:54,616 A:middle
We are making these prototypes,
showing them to people,

203
00:10:55,276 --> 00:10:56,376 A:middle
and learning from
their feedback.

204
00:10:57,566 --> 00:11:00,316 A:middle
This is actually a
bit of a cycle; right?

205

206
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

207
00:10:57,566 --> 00:11:00,316 A:middle
This is actually a
bit of a cycle; right?

208
00:11:00,316 --> 00:11:01,926 A:middle
We make things, we
show them to people,

209
00:11:02,236 --> 00:11:03,276 A:middle
we learn from their feedback.

210
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:05,696 A:middle
Something we've talked
about a little bit before

211
00:11:05,696 --> 00:11:06,466 A:middle
in some other sessions.

212
00:11:08,216 --> 00:11:13,606 A:middle
So today, to get a more
concrete example of how we try

213
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,826 A:middle
out animation, we are going to
build some animated prototypes

214
00:11:17,696 --> 00:11:19,646 A:middle
for an app that some of
you might have heard of.

215
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,316 A:middle
It's called Toast Modern.

216
00:11:22,251 --> 00:11:24,251 A:middle
[Applause]

217
00:11:24,486 --> 00:11:26,316 A:middle
Now, it's okay if you
haven't heard of Toast Modern.

218
00:11:27,076 --> 00:11:29,196 A:middle
It still has its
original feature,

219
00:11:29,836 --> 00:11:36,636 A:middle
which is to help people
find local artisanal toast,

220
00:11:37,426 --> 00:11:39,646 A:middle
San Francisco's finest
food export.

221
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,746 A:middle
But over the past year,
Toast Modern has been

222
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:46,006 A:middle
so successful we've been adding
all sorts of new features.

223
00:11:47,536 --> 00:11:49,866 A:middle
People can share the toast
they found with other people.

224
00:11:50,396 --> 00:11:54,356 A:middle
You can comment on toast.

225
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:57,356 A:middle
If you watched a session
yesterday, you might have seen

226
00:11:57,356 --> 00:12:00,886 A:middle
that we've connected Toast
Modern to Toastal Service.

227

228
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

229
00:11:57,356 --> 00:12:00,886 A:middle
that we've connected Toast
Modern to Toastal Service.

230
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:04,886 A:middle
The world's first
social toaster.

231
00:12:05,031 --> 00:12:07,031 A:middle
[Laughter]

232
00:12:07,046 --> 00:12:08,736 A:middle
And now that people are
making their own toast

233
00:12:09,016 --> 00:12:12,626 A:middle
and posting these pictures,
I can see my toast along

234
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:13,666 A:middle
with these toast restaurants.

235
00:12:14,736 --> 00:12:16,106 A:middle
And now I can see
my friend's toast.

236
00:12:17,276 --> 00:12:18,796 A:middle
And frankly, the biggest
thing we are seeing

237
00:12:18,796 --> 00:12:21,886 A:middle
with this app now is we are just
getting overwhelmed by toast.

238
00:12:22,586 --> 00:12:28,406 A:middle
So today we are going to
focus on a single feature.

239
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:31,096 A:middle
We are going to really
dive in and look

240
00:12:31,096 --> 00:12:33,676 A:middle
at different ways we can
animate just this one feature

241
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:35,646 A:middle
and how we can make just
this one feature great.

242
00:12:35,646 --> 00:12:40,176 A:middle
What we are going to do is
slice through all this toast

243
00:12:40,946 --> 00:12:41,996 A:middle
to find our favorites.

244
00:12:43,336 --> 00:12:47,526 A:middle
Now, to do that, without
writing a line of code,

245
00:12:48,146 --> 00:12:49,976 A:middle
I would like to invite
Joe up to the stage.

246
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:55,666 A:middle
[Applause]

247
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:56,886 A:middle
>> JOE MALIA: Thanks, Julian.

248
00:12:58,886 --> 00:13:05,686 A:middle
Hi. I'm Joe, and I spend most
of my day in the team designing

249

250
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

251
00:12:58,886 --> 00:13:05,686 A:middle
Hi. I'm Joe, and I spend most
of my day in the team designing

252
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:09,116 A:middle
and animating and not
writing very much code.

253
00:13:10,076 --> 00:13:12,766 A:middle
So today I am going
to be talking

254
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:17,476 A:middle
about the Favorites
button in Toast Modern.

255
00:13:17,476 --> 00:13:21,626 A:middle
So we are going to run
through a few ideas

256
00:13:21,846 --> 00:13:24,526 A:middle
for how animation can
bring a feature to life.

257
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,376 A:middle
We are going to look
at the process

258
00:13:27,466 --> 00:13:30,016 A:middle
of designing animation
into an app.

259
00:13:30,466 --> 00:13:33,346 A:middle
We are going to look in at a
few places where animation fits,

260
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,136 A:middle
a few places that it doesn't.

261
00:13:36,196 --> 00:13:39,936 A:middle
Animation is a powerful
- [ding] -- I am sorry.

262
00:13:39,936 --> 00:13:41,606 A:middle
This is a little
bit embarrassing,

263
00:13:41,606 --> 00:13:44,296 A:middle
but I forgot to turn
my phone off.

264
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:47,686 A:middle
So let me just -- oh,
actually, it's okay.

265
00:13:47,686 --> 00:13:49,796 A:middle
It's an email from
the Toast Modern CEO.

266
00:13:50,086 --> 00:13:52,746 A:middle
Bill, could we get this
up on screen, please?

267
00:13:53,576 --> 00:13:55,406 A:middle
Thanks. Okay.

268
00:13:56,596 --> 00:13:56,916 A:middle
So -

269
00:13:57,516 --> 00:13:59,976 A:middle
[Applause]

270

271
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

272
00:14:00,476 --> 00:14:01,906 A:middle
-- he's had some thoughts.

273
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:06,906 A:middle
So let's see what he says.

274
00:14:07,476 --> 00:14:09,986 A:middle
After some deep meditation
in my yurt,

275
00:14:11,196 --> 00:14:12,586 A:middle
some revolutionary new ideas

276
00:14:12,866 --> 00:14:15,506 A:middle
for our app have come
into focus for me.

277
00:14:16,176 --> 00:14:18,886 A:middle
People need to know that the
Favorite button is there.

278
00:14:19,156 --> 00:14:20,446 A:middle
Okay? We can do that.

279
00:14:21,706 --> 00:14:24,806 A:middle
Two, people need to
be able to find toast

280
00:14:25,036 --> 00:14:25,916 A:middle
that they've favorited.

281
00:14:26,076 --> 00:14:26,996 A:middle
Okay. That sounds fair enough.

282
00:14:27,956 --> 00:14:31,486 A:middle
Three, using the Favorite button
should be simple and elegant.

283
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:33,816 A:middle
People should be able to
use it from the first touch.

284
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:34,706 A:middle
That sounds fair enough.

285
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:36,556 A:middle
Okay? So no rush.

286
00:14:36,766 --> 00:14:40,906 A:middle
Just send me something to try
out in the next 20 minutes.

287
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:43,566 A:middle
[Laughter]

288
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:44,756 A:middle
Namaste. Okay.

289
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:46,296 A:middle
[Laughter]

290
00:14:46,296 --> 00:14:48,226 A:middle
So here we go.

291
00:14:48,226 --> 00:14:50,946 A:middle
We haven't got much time,
so we need to dive right in.

292
00:14:51,286 --> 00:14:54,946 A:middle
We are going to start trying to
animate as many different ideas

293
00:14:54,946 --> 00:14:58,726 A:middle
as we possibly can in a short
time, get through as many

294
00:14:58,726 --> 00:15:00,876 A:middle
as we can quickly, and
get them onto a device.

295

296
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

297
00:14:58,726 --> 00:15:00,876 A:middle
as we can quickly, and
get them onto a device.

298
00:15:02,106 --> 00:15:05,006 A:middle
So the designers out there
amongst you might use

299
00:15:05,006 --> 00:15:08,596 A:middle
After Effects or Quartz Composer
in a situation like this.

300
00:15:09,596 --> 00:15:13,356 A:middle
Any developers might
turn to Swift, HTML, CSS.

301
00:15:13,356 --> 00:15:17,786 A:middle
So these are great tools,
but for those of you

302
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:20,346 A:middle
that don't know those
tools or don't have access

303
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:24,096 A:middle
to them, there is Keynote.

304
00:15:24,426 --> 00:15:27,176 A:middle
And that's what we are
going to be using today

305
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,086 A:middle
because it's very quick to
make animations, and it's very,

306
00:15:30,086 --> 00:15:33,456 A:middle
very quick to get
things onto a device.

307
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:38,276 A:middle
So let's look again at
the requests from our CEO.

308
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:43,956 A:middle
Conveniently, they map very well
to the three principles laid

309
00:15:43,956 --> 00:15:45,616 A:middle
out by Julian in his
part of the talk.

310
00:15:45,616 --> 00:15:50,096 A:middle
So let's focus on the
first one to begin with.

311
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:52,606 A:middle
People need to know that the
Favorite button is there.

312
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:57,766 A:middle
So let's look at an example
where animation is used

313
00:15:58,066 --> 00:16:02,146 A:middle
to subtly draw attention
to a feature within an app.

314

315
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

316
00:15:58,066 --> 00:16:02,146 A:middle
to subtly draw attention
to a feature within an app.

317
00:16:02,646 --> 00:16:06,416 A:middle
As we can see here, the
iBeam is blinking slowly

318
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:09,036 A:middle
to pull people's attention
to it, to show people

319
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:11,586 A:middle
where text will be entered
as they start to type.

320
00:16:12,396 --> 00:16:15,506 A:middle
It's very subtle but
actually really easy to pick

321
00:16:15,506 --> 00:16:17,066 A:middle
out amongst all the text.

322
00:16:17,616 --> 00:16:20,586 A:middle
What we can see here is the
change is very attractive

323
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:20,946 A:middle
to the eye.

324
00:16:22,476 --> 00:16:25,406 A:middle
So let's think about
a few different ways

325
00:16:25,406 --> 00:16:28,226 A:middle
that we can use animation
to draw attention

326
00:16:28,326 --> 00:16:29,186 A:middle
to our Favorite button.

327
00:16:29,766 --> 00:16:34,836 A:middle
So we don't have much
time, as you have seen.

328
00:16:34,836 --> 00:16:39,176 A:middle
All I've done is screen-grabbed
the existing Toast Modern

329
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:40,366 A:middle
layout, and I am just going

330
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,906 A:middle
to paste it straight
into Keynote here.

331
00:16:42,076 --> 00:16:45,796 A:middle
So we are going to
open the shapes panel

332
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:49,076 A:middle
and grab the star icon,
and we are going to place

333
00:16:49,146 --> 00:16:51,526 A:middle
that into each line in our list.

334
00:16:53,986 --> 00:16:55,076 A:middle
Okay. Great.

335
00:16:55,606 --> 00:16:59,396 A:middle
Now let's zoom in to get
a closer look and think

336
00:16:59,396 --> 00:17:01,546 A:middle
about how we can change
some of the properties

337

338
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

339
00:16:59,396 --> 00:17:01,546 A:middle
about how we can change
some of the properties

340
00:17:01,546 --> 00:17:03,376 A:middle
of this button over time.

341
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:08,286 A:middle
So we can change the opacity
to simulate the gentle blinking

342
00:17:08,286 --> 00:17:09,516 A:middle
that we saw in the
Notes app earlier.

343
00:17:09,516 --> 00:17:11,496 A:middle
Okay. That's nice.

344
00:17:12,026 --> 00:17:12,756 A:middle
It's pretty subtle.

345
00:17:13,526 --> 00:17:14,546 A:middle
How about something
more dramatic?

346
00:17:14,546 --> 00:17:18,246 A:middle
We could change the
rotation, the color,

347
00:17:18,396 --> 00:17:20,126 A:middle
the scale, at the same time.

348
00:17:20,976 --> 00:17:23,336 A:middle
We could change the shape.

349
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,935 A:middle
It's just scaling down
one object and scaling

350
00:17:26,935 --> 00:17:27,986 A:middle
up another one quickly.

351
00:17:27,986 --> 00:17:32,856 A:middle
We could give it some character
by sticking some bounce in there

352
00:17:32,856 --> 00:17:33,706 A:middle
and adding a little face.

353
00:17:33,826 --> 00:17:37,706 A:middle
So we could animate the
layers at timed intervals

354
00:17:38,336 --> 00:17:40,156 A:middle
to create some patterns as well.

355
00:17:41,466 --> 00:17:47,396 A:middle
So let's zoom back out and try
that one across the entire list

356
00:17:47,396 --> 00:17:51,816 A:middle
to see how attention-grabbing
it is.

357
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:54,976 A:middle
Okay. So it's definitely
grabbing attention,

358
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,586 A:middle
but if it's going to be
animating constantly like this,

359
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:01,986 A:middle
it could go way beyond
just grabbing attention,

360

361
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

362
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:01,986 A:middle
it could go way beyond
just grabbing attention,

363
00:18:01,986 --> 00:18:03,516 A:middle
actually become quite
distracting.

364
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,126 A:middle
It's not really telling
us anything new

365
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,706 A:middle
by animating all the time.

366
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,056 A:middle
So let's look at a few
examples around iOS

367
00:18:11,796 --> 00:18:16,046 A:middle
where animation is used to
draw attention and have a look

368
00:18:16,046 --> 00:18:17,396 A:middle
at when it's relevant.

369
00:18:18,626 --> 00:18:21,856 A:middle
We see our notification
for an email appear

370
00:18:21,886 --> 00:18:24,136 A:middle
at the moment that
we get an email.

371
00:18:24,376 --> 00:18:29,326 A:middle
Okay? We see this gently pulsing
link appear when we've jumped

372
00:18:29,326 --> 00:18:32,316 A:middle
out of an app to
help us get back in.

373
00:18:32,316 --> 00:18:34,496 A:middle
And notifications
shift into view

374
00:18:34,796 --> 00:18:38,786 A:middle
when there's something very
important for us to know.

375
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:41,706 A:middle
So the thing that these
animations have in common is

376
00:18:41,706 --> 00:18:43,416 A:middle
that they occur at the moment

377
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,576 A:middle
that they are relevant
to the user.

378
00:18:45,606 --> 00:18:47,476 A:middle
They are not constantly
calling for attention.

379
00:18:48,656 --> 00:18:51,186 A:middle
We want people to notice
the Favorite button

380
00:18:51,316 --> 00:18:53,196 A:middle
when they first use the app.

381
00:18:54,496 --> 00:18:57,766 A:middle
So we can use animation
to introduce the feature

382
00:18:58,026 --> 00:18:59,056 A:middle
when people launch the app.

383
00:18:59,576 --> 00:19:04,366 A:middle
And actually, there's
a whole bunch

384

385
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

386
00:18:59,576 --> 00:19:04,366 A:middle
And actually, there's
a whole bunch

387
00:19:04,366 --> 00:19:06,046 A:middle
of different ways we
could just move the button

388
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:07,276 A:middle
into position like this.

389
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,146 A:middle
So these are looking nice,

390
00:19:10,426 --> 00:19:14,036 A:middle
but they actually dominate the
action for a chunk of time,

391
00:19:14,036 --> 00:19:16,676 A:middle
and if I am just obsessed
with toast, really want to get

392
00:19:16,676 --> 00:19:18,796 A:middle
in there, start favoriting
toast or looking at toast,

393
00:19:18,796 --> 00:19:20,806 A:middle
they are taking up
the entire screen.

394
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:26,166 A:middle
So what we want is something to
come into focus, grab attention,

395
00:19:26,476 --> 00:19:28,756 A:middle
but not take over the action.

396
00:19:29,036 --> 00:19:30,276 A:middle
So we'll just do
something like this.

397
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:32,456 A:middle
Okay. Let's see that again.

398
00:19:33,576 --> 00:19:36,536 A:middle
Okay. So as I said, we
don't have much time,

399
00:19:36,536 --> 00:19:38,046 A:middle
so we are just going
to keep going.

400
00:19:38,986 --> 00:19:42,786 A:middle
The second part of the
email asked us to ensure

401
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:46,376 A:middle
that people know where their
favorite toast has gone once

402
00:19:46,376 --> 00:19:47,116 A:middle
they favorited it.

403
00:19:48,606 --> 00:19:52,336 A:middle
So if people start to
favorite toast, as more

404
00:19:52,336 --> 00:19:54,286 A:middle
and more new toast is
added to that list,

405
00:19:54,286 --> 00:19:56,856 A:middle
their favorites are going to
end up way down that list.

406
00:19:56,976 --> 00:19:58,716 A:middle
They are going to be hard
to find in the future.

407
00:19:58,716 --> 00:20:02,896 A:middle
What we need is a
place to store a list

408

409
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

410
00:19:58,716 --> 00:20:02,896 A:middle
What we need is a
place to store a list

411
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:04,926 A:middle
of only our favorite toast.

412
00:20:05,836 --> 00:20:08,536 A:middle
So let's create two buttons
at the bottom of our screen,

413
00:20:09,116 --> 00:20:12,606 A:middle
one that's going to
show us all of our toast

414
00:20:12,606 --> 00:20:16,216 A:middle
and the other one that's only
going to show us our favorites

415
00:20:16,486 --> 00:20:17,276 A:middle
on a different screen.

416
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:21,026 A:middle
So when I tap that Favorite
button, it will animate

417
00:20:21,026 --> 00:20:25,346 A:middle
in from the right and back.

418
00:20:25,886 --> 00:20:26,816 A:middle
Okay. Great.

419
00:20:27,636 --> 00:20:29,176 A:middle
So now we've gone
through the process

420
00:20:29,176 --> 00:20:33,086 A:middle
of designing a simple
structure for our app.

421
00:20:33,356 --> 00:20:35,106 A:middle
Now, this might feel
like we've done enough,

422
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:38,186 A:middle
but we can actually
go one step further.

423
00:20:39,526 --> 00:20:43,386 A:middle
When someone makes a favorite,
let's use animation to hint

424
00:20:43,896 --> 00:20:47,186 A:middle
as to where those favorites
have ended up in the app.

425
00:20:48,506 --> 00:20:53,086 A:middle
So we want a model for
moving toast around our app.

426
00:20:53,956 --> 00:20:56,986 A:middle
So let's look at how
we might move toast

427
00:20:56,986 --> 00:20:59,846 A:middle
around in the real world
as a starting point.

428

429
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

430
00:21:00,406 --> 00:21:07,086 A:middle
So if I was to move toast
from one plate to another,

431
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:14,736 A:middle
it wouldn't just disappear and
reappear on the other plate, or,

432
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,056 A:middle
like, disappear out
of view altogether,

433
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:20,486 A:middle
giving me no idea
of where it's gone.

434
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:24,576 A:middle
Instead, as we move it,
we can keep track of it

435
00:21:24,886 --> 00:21:28,816 A:middle
by following its journey
between the plates.

436
00:21:28,986 --> 00:21:32,916 A:middle
Even when it moves out of sight.

437
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:36,046 A:middle
So we can create connections
between different parts

438
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:40,456 A:middle
of our app by moving toast
along a path like this.

439
00:21:41,126 --> 00:21:44,026 A:middle
We can animate this
transition in many ways.

440
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:48,126 A:middle
So imagine that the toast gets
swallowed up by a toaster,

441
00:21:48,426 --> 00:21:50,946 A:middle
spat out along the path, and
ends up in the toast list.

442
00:21:51,516 --> 00:21:55,626 A:middle
[Applause]

443
00:21:56,126 --> 00:21:57,876 A:middle
Let's see that one
again, I think.

444
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,216 A:middle
There we go.

445

446
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

447
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,216 A:middle
There we go.

448
00:22:02,766 --> 00:22:06,606 A:middle
Alternatively, we could let
the user define the shape

449
00:22:06,776 --> 00:22:08,416 A:middle
of that path by allowing them

450
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:11,206 A:middle
to track the toast
to the Favorite area.

451
00:22:12,516 --> 00:22:14,646 A:middle
So we know that favorites
are off to the right.

452
00:22:16,196 --> 00:22:18,296 A:middle
So the toast could
move out to the right,

453
00:22:18,686 --> 00:22:20,666 A:middle
get gobbled up, and
then shoot back.

454
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:27,106 A:middle
So as we tap the Star
button, it can expand,

455
00:22:27,106 --> 00:22:31,726 A:middle
swallow up the toast,
pull it over to the right.

456
00:22:33,126 --> 00:22:34,806 A:middle
Or the entire panel
could move over,

457
00:22:34,806 --> 00:22:37,736 A:middle
and then we could move
it back when we don't

458
00:22:37,976 --> 00:22:38,926 A:middle
like that toast anymore.

459
00:22:39,376 --> 00:22:43,216 A:middle
We have created a lot of
options to choose from.

460
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:45,776 A:middle
That's what we are
doing, prototyping

461
00:22:45,776 --> 00:22:47,446 A:middle
and creating options
for ourselves.

462
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:52,036 A:middle
So we created an animation
that draws attention

463
00:22:52,036 --> 00:22:56,486 A:middle
to our new feature, and we
prepared an animation that hints

464
00:22:56,586 --> 00:22:57,966 A:middle
at the structure of our app.

465
00:22:59,096 --> 00:23:03,076 A:middle
But the CEO wants people to
be able to use the button

466

467
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

468
00:22:59,096 --> 00:23:03,076 A:middle
But the CEO wants people to
be able to use the button

469
00:23:03,236 --> 00:23:06,826 A:middle
from the first touch, and in
order to do that, we are going

470
00:23:06,826 --> 00:23:11,486 A:middle
to think about how
animation responds to touch.

471
00:23:11,706 --> 00:23:15,166 A:middle
But we can begin one step
before that by looking

472
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:18,426 A:middle
at how animation can suggest
how to interact with a piece

473
00:23:18,426 --> 00:23:21,546 A:middle
of toast before you've
even touched it.

474
00:23:22,436 --> 00:23:24,216 A:middle
So on the Lock screen here,

475
00:23:24,586 --> 00:23:26,516 A:middle
we can see an animated
highlight move

476
00:23:26,516 --> 00:23:28,746 A:middle
across the words
"Slide to Unlock."

477
00:23:29,856 --> 00:23:31,456 A:middle
There's meaning in
this movement.

478
00:23:32,076 --> 00:23:34,076 A:middle
It travels in the direction
you are meant to swipe.

479
00:23:34,976 --> 00:23:38,136 A:middle
It offers a subtle cue to
encourage the users to act

480
00:23:38,136 --> 00:23:39,336 A:middle
on it in a specific way.

481
00:23:40,596 --> 00:23:42,756 A:middle
It's elegantly foreshadowing
the interaction.

482
00:23:43,306 --> 00:23:48,746 A:middle
Let's see if we can create an
animation that hints to the user

483
00:23:48,746 --> 00:23:50,166 A:middle
that they should
tap this button.

484
00:23:51,316 --> 00:23:52,606 A:middle
So we will zoom in again.

485
00:23:53,216 --> 00:23:59,256 A:middle
We could move the button down
to hint that it's been pressed.

486

487
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

488
00:24:00,636 --> 00:24:03,146 A:middle
Or we could animate the shadow

489
00:24:03,146 --> 00:24:04,736 A:middle
of an imaginary finger
tapping it.

490
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,966 A:middle
Or we could use a highlight
to give some depth and travel.

491
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:12,616 A:middle
Let's just take that
idea quickly and try it

492
00:24:12,616 --> 00:24:13,786 A:middle
across our entire list.

493
00:24:14,346 --> 00:24:19,856 A:middle
So it's actually pretty subtle,
so we could add some color

494
00:24:20,016 --> 00:24:22,046 A:middle
to hint to the user the
change that they will see

495
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:23,036 A:middle
when they tap the button.

496
00:24:24,446 --> 00:24:28,776 A:middle
Okay. So in iOS, you can
actually interact with buttons

497
00:24:28,776 --> 00:24:31,726 A:middle
and features in many different
ways, and the more complex

498
00:24:32,036 --> 00:24:34,356 A:middle
and sophisticated
an interaction,

499
00:24:34,676 --> 00:24:36,426 A:middle
the more foreshadowing
it may need.

500
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:39,976 A:middle
But a tap, what we have here,
is actually very simple.

501
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:43,176 A:middle
And in this case, it's
probably enough to suggest

502
00:24:43,176 --> 00:24:46,156 A:middle
that you can act on it
just by it being there,

503
00:24:46,436 --> 00:24:48,586 A:middle
just through its
presence in the app.

504
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:49,736 A:middle
So the simplest option is best.

505
00:24:49,736 --> 00:24:52,686 A:middle
Let's just reserve
animation for the moment

506
00:24:52,686 --> 00:24:54,146 A:middle
that you first touch the screen.

507
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:59,136 A:middle
So we want some feedback
when you first tap the app.

508
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,386 A:middle
So let's start by making the
star bigger when you touch down,

509

510
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

511
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,386 A:middle
So let's start by making the
star bigger when you touch down,

512
00:25:02,386 --> 00:25:05,916 A:middle
and the moment that you lift
your finger up, let's imagine

513
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:08,866 A:middle
that it travels a little way
before bouncing back down.

514
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:10,756 A:middle
Okay. That's great.

515
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:12,766 A:middle
But what we are going to
do is we are going to need

516
00:25:12,766 --> 00:25:14,466 A:middle
to get a feel for
this interaction.

517
00:25:14,686 --> 00:25:17,066 A:middle
So we can do that by
jumping into QuickTime

518
00:25:17,596 --> 00:25:19,766 A:middle
and screen-grabbing
the animation

519
00:25:19,766 --> 00:25:20,766 A:middle
that we've just created.

520
00:25:21,356 --> 00:25:24,716 A:middle
Then what I can do is I
can open up a movie of that

521
00:25:25,586 --> 00:25:27,566 A:middle
and get a very basic
feel for the interaction

522
00:25:27,566 --> 00:25:30,646 A:middle
by scrubbing the timeline as
I pretend to touch the button.

523
00:25:30,646 --> 00:25:34,956 A:middle
So as it scales up, it is
starting to feel a little bit

524
00:25:34,956 --> 00:25:36,516 A:middle
like it's coming towards me.

525
00:25:36,516 --> 00:25:38,066 A:middle
So this gives me the impression

526
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:39,316 A:middle
that I can actually
drag it around.

527
00:25:39,316 --> 00:25:40,176 A:middle
Now, why is that?

528
00:25:40,896 --> 00:25:43,546 A:middle
It kind of reminds
me of something

529
00:25:43,546 --> 00:25:45,696 A:middle
that we see here
in the Email app.

530
00:25:47,026 --> 00:25:50,586 A:middle
As I press and hold on a name,
it appears to lift off the page,

531
00:25:51,066 --> 00:25:53,346 A:middle
which gives me the
sensation I can actually start

532
00:25:53,346 --> 00:25:54,226 A:middle
to move it around.

533
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,606 A:middle
This isn't actually
what we are after here,

534
00:25:58,896 --> 00:26:00,506 A:middle
so when we press
the Favorite button,

535

536
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

537
00:25:58,896 --> 00:26:00,506 A:middle
so when we press
the Favorite button,

538
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:03,926 A:middle
let's make it slightly smaller,
as if it's moving away from you.

539
00:26:05,006 --> 00:26:06,266 A:middle
And we could also
make it darker.

540
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:12,086 A:middle
Okay. It can still bounce up
when we've lifted our finger up.

541
00:26:13,256 --> 00:26:15,206 A:middle
So let's integrate
that with the animation

542
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,406 A:middle
that we created before,
see how it looks.

543
00:26:18,566 --> 00:26:25,076 A:middle
So now we are almost ready
to start favoriting toast.

544
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:28,686 A:middle
Let's have a look at this.

545
00:26:28,686 --> 00:26:32,256 A:middle
Great. We have tackled the
three items from the CEO's list,

546
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:35,526 A:middle
but we need to get a
feel for these animations

547
00:26:35,586 --> 00:26:38,016 A:middle
on a device before we
can send it back to him.

548
00:26:39,146 --> 00:26:44,026 A:middle
So let's head into
Keynote one last time.

549
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:47,236 A:middle
We are going to build our
animation at this orientation,

550
00:26:47,526 --> 00:26:48,586 A:middle
the orientation of the device.

551
00:26:48,586 --> 00:26:51,966 A:middle
We are going to build our
animations in this format,

552
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:56,326 A:middle
and then we are going to load
it onto the phone, open Keynote,

553
00:26:56,426 --> 00:26:58,836 A:middle
open the file, and
then we can just tap

554
00:26:58,916 --> 00:26:59,896 A:middle
through the interaction.

555

556
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

557
00:27:01,656 --> 00:27:05,746 A:middle
So what I'll do is I'll grab
that animation that we created

558
00:27:06,356 --> 00:27:09,296 A:middle
and some of the assets
that we've created

559
00:27:09,946 --> 00:27:13,266 A:middle
and the pressing email from
our CEO, and I will send them

560
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:15,336 A:middle
over to my colleague,
Marek, who is going

561
00:27:15,336 --> 00:27:18,926 A:middle
to start integrating some code
to raise everything up a notch.

562
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:20,026 A:middle
So, Marek.

563
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:24,606 A:middle
[Applause]

564
00:27:25,106 --> 00:27:27,646 A:middle
>> MAREK BEREZA:
Thanks a lot, Joe.

565
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,736 A:middle
Hi. My name is Marek,
and I spend most

566
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:34,606 A:middle
of my time making interactive
prototypes with a little bit

567
00:27:34,606 --> 00:27:39,836 A:middle
of code, but much less code
than you might imagine.

568
00:27:39,836 --> 00:27:42,446 A:middle
Now, Joe's just sent
me this Keynote file,

569
00:27:43,006 --> 00:27:46,356 A:middle
and it's really amazing
how far he's managed to get

570
00:27:46,356 --> 00:27:48,456 A:middle
without having to write
a single line of code.

571
00:27:49,236 --> 00:27:53,366 A:middle
But as you know, the CEO of
Toast Modern is on our backs,

572
00:27:53,516 --> 00:27:55,196 A:middle
so we really need to get
going, and we are going

573
00:27:55,196 --> 00:27:56,706 A:middle
to do a little bit
of programming

574
00:27:57,096 --> 00:28:00,366 A:middle
to create an interactive
prototype.

575

576
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

577
00:27:57,096 --> 00:28:00,366 A:middle
to create an interactive
prototype.

578
00:28:00,366 --> 00:28:03,506 A:middle
Now, the main reason
to make a prototype is

579
00:28:03,506 --> 00:28:07,126 A:middle
so that we can get a feel for
these animations in our hand

580
00:28:07,496 --> 00:28:10,596 A:middle
on the device with the
interactions involved.

581
00:28:11,586 --> 00:28:14,286 A:middle
And only then can we ask
ourselves the questions:

582
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:15,926 A:middle
Does it work?

583
00:28:17,486 --> 00:28:19,986 A:middle
What doesn't work
about the animation?

584
00:28:20,516 --> 00:28:23,126 A:middle
And then if it doesn't work,
then why doesn't it work?

585
00:28:23,766 --> 00:28:30,076 A:middle
So the second reason to make
interactive prototypes is

586
00:28:30,306 --> 00:28:31,646 A:middle
to let other people try it.

587
00:28:32,526 --> 00:28:34,556 A:middle
Now, maybe this is even more
important than the first point.

588
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:38,466 A:middle
Now, you might be a really
good judge of your animations,

589
00:28:39,206 --> 00:28:42,576 A:middle
but at the end of the day,
there's just no replacement

590
00:28:42,576 --> 00:28:43,846 A:middle
for an outsider's opinion.

591
00:28:44,906 --> 00:28:47,766 A:middle
You, yourself, have got a
strong emotional investment

592
00:28:47,766 --> 00:28:48,326 A:middle
in your app.

593
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:50,346 A:middle
You spent loads of
time working on it.

594
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:54,506 A:middle
So really, you need to find
someone who isn't invested,

595
00:28:54,726 --> 00:28:56,856 A:middle
someone who doesn't know what
these animations are supposed

596
00:28:56,916 --> 00:29:00,266 A:middle
to say, and see if they get it.

597

598
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

599
00:28:56,916 --> 00:29:00,266 A:middle
to say, and see if they get it.

600
00:29:00,266 --> 00:29:02,356 A:middle
I just quickly want to
go back to this diagram

601
00:29:02,356 --> 00:29:06,136 A:middle
that Julian showed earlier,
this cycle of making something,

602
00:29:06,566 --> 00:29:09,926 A:middle
showing someone, and then
learning from their feedback.

603
00:29:10,256 --> 00:29:12,696 A:middle
It's really important to
take what you've learned

604
00:29:12,696 --> 00:29:15,266 A:middle
and put it back into
the making process

605
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:20,306 A:middle
so you can keep iterating
until you get it right.

606
00:29:20,566 --> 00:29:23,916 A:middle
Now, the third reason is so
that you can make changes

607
00:29:24,146 --> 00:29:24,966 A:middle
really easily.

608
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:27,366 A:middle
If you try doing
this sort of stuff

609
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:29,106 A:middle
with production-style code,

610
00:29:29,516 --> 00:29:31,616 A:middle
you end up writing
quite a lot of code.

611
00:29:31,616 --> 00:29:34,836 A:middle
And then when you want to make a
small change, you end up having

612
00:29:34,836 --> 00:29:37,296 A:middle
to scrap a lot of code and
then write a lot more code.

613
00:29:37,906 --> 00:29:41,476 A:middle
So if you make these little
interactive prototypes,

614
00:29:41,886 --> 00:29:45,366 A:middle
then you end up saving yourself
a lot of time and money.

615
00:29:46,626 --> 00:29:49,536 A:middle
Now, what are these
interactive prototype things?

616
00:29:50,336 --> 00:29:53,156 A:middle
Well, essentially, we are
going to build an app,

617
00:29:53,156 --> 00:29:56,966 A:middle
but we are going to cut as
many corners as we possibly can

618
00:29:57,306 --> 00:30:00,746 A:middle
to create the illusion
of a fully fledged app

619

620
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

621
00:29:57,306 --> 00:30:00,746 A:middle
to create the illusion
of a fully fledged app

622
00:30:00,956 --> 00:30:02,396 A:middle
so we can test out
our animations.

623
00:30:03,626 --> 00:30:07,076 A:middle
The easiest way that I can
think to do this is rather

624
00:30:07,076 --> 00:30:09,116 A:middle
than using navigation
controllers

625
00:30:09,116 --> 00:30:10,906 A:middle
and all these UI controls,

626
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,856 A:middle
we are just going
to work with images.

627
00:30:14,526 --> 00:30:17,616 A:middle
So I've taken a few
screenshots from Joe's Keynote.

628
00:30:18,056 --> 00:30:21,766 A:middle
We've got one picture of
the main app with that row

629
00:30:21,766 --> 00:30:23,486 A:middle
that we are going to
make interactive missing.

630
00:30:24,326 --> 00:30:26,056 A:middle
We've got one picture of the row

631
00:30:26,056 --> 00:30:27,866 A:middle
that we are going
to make interactive.

632
00:30:28,476 --> 00:30:31,286 A:middle
And then that same row,
the favorited version.

633
00:30:32,306 --> 00:30:34,546 A:middle
And this is what
our code looks like.

634
00:30:34,856 --> 00:30:35,596 A:middle
It's very rough.

635
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:38,216 A:middle
We've got three lines of code

636
00:30:38,376 --> 00:30:40,316 A:middle
to load those three
images we just saw.

637
00:30:41,426 --> 00:30:44,756 A:middle
This block of code adds
those images as subviews

638
00:30:44,826 --> 00:30:47,476 A:middle
to our main view and
puts them into place.

639
00:30:48,286 --> 00:30:50,876 A:middle
Then this block of code
listens for a touch event,

640
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:52,376 A:middle
and when it gets a touch event,

641
00:30:52,846 --> 00:30:56,036 A:middle
it animates that favorites row
off to the right-hand side,

642
00:30:56,036 --> 00:31:00,386 A:middle
and then it brings the favorited
version of the row from behind.

643

644
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

645
00:30:56,036 --> 00:31:00,386 A:middle
and then it brings the favorited
version of the row from behind.

646
00:31:01,696 --> 00:31:04,296 A:middle
So running it on the phone
looks something like this.

647
00:31:04,476 --> 00:31:08,466 A:middle
We've got a working prototype,
15 lines of code, 3 pictures.

648
00:31:08,836 --> 00:31:09,546 A:middle
Couldn't be easier.

649
00:31:10,616 --> 00:31:14,246 A:middle
We can try it out straightaway,
and as soon as we tried it out,

650
00:31:14,246 --> 00:31:17,586 A:middle
we discovered something
wrong, and that was

651
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:20,966 A:middle
that when we put our finger
down initially, nothing happens.

652
00:31:21,326 --> 00:31:22,916 A:middle
Joe mentioned something
about this.

653
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:26,186 A:middle
When you put your finger
down on most buttons in iOS,

654
00:31:26,756 --> 00:31:29,456 A:middle
they respond to you, and it's
really important that they do

655
00:31:29,456 --> 00:31:32,606 A:middle
because it's telling you that
this isn't just a static part

656
00:31:32,606 --> 00:31:34,636 A:middle
of the screen, it's
an interactive thing.

657
00:31:35,196 --> 00:31:40,356 A:middle
In order to dig into
this problem deeper,

658
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:45,006 A:middle
a really good way to do this is
to break down the interaction.

659
00:31:45,276 --> 00:31:50,656 A:middle
Most interactions can be
broken down into the stages

660
00:31:51,066 --> 00:31:58,836 A:middle
of the start, the
change, and the complete.

661
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:04,906 A:middle
And each of these stages
is an opportunity for you

662

663
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

664
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:04,906 A:middle
And each of these stages
is an opportunity for you

665
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:10,596 A:middle
to help guide the user on their
way through the interaction.

666
00:32:10,736 --> 00:32:12,336 A:middle
Now let's think of
this in terms of touch.

667
00:32:13,576 --> 00:32:17,656 A:middle
We've got the start, which
might be our touchdown.

668
00:32:18,386 --> 00:32:21,456 A:middle
We've got the change,
which is moving your finger

669
00:32:21,456 --> 00:32:22,346 A:middle
across the screen.

670
00:32:22,346 --> 00:32:25,546 A:middle
And then the complete, when you
lift your finger off the screen.

671
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:29,846 A:middle
And in programming, we
think of touches began,

672
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:32,196 A:middle
touches moved, and
touches ended.

673
00:32:32,196 --> 00:32:35,566 A:middle
Now let's go back to
our Favorites button.

674
00:32:35,866 --> 00:32:39,646 A:middle
So as the finger goes down, we
need to respond to the user.

675
00:32:40,316 --> 00:32:42,206 A:middle
Maybe we can just
make that star grow

676
00:32:42,206 --> 00:32:44,556 A:middle
or do something a little
bit more intelligent

677
00:32:44,706 --> 00:32:46,206 A:middle
as to what Joe is talking about.

678
00:32:47,526 --> 00:32:49,676 A:middle
Now, moving your finger
around on a button,

679
00:32:50,116 --> 00:32:52,756 A:middle
maybe if the user moves
their finger off the button,

680
00:32:53,106 --> 00:32:55,016 A:middle
we can allow them to move out --

681
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:59,066 A:middle
I mean, to back out of what
the action is going to do.

682
00:32:59,066 --> 00:33:03,026 A:middle
So maybe for the animation,
we just reverse that animation

683

684
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

685
00:32:59,066 --> 00:33:03,026 A:middle
So maybe for the animation,
we just reverse that animation

686
00:33:03,306 --> 00:33:04,366 A:middle
to go back to the start

687
00:33:04,366 --> 00:33:07,906 A:middle
to reassure the user
nothing is going to happen.

688
00:33:07,906 --> 00:33:09,896 A:middle
And then finally,
the complete stage.

689
00:33:10,306 --> 00:33:11,746 A:middle
If they want to complete,

690
00:33:12,196 --> 00:33:16,346 A:middle
we have to make sure we reward
the user, make sure they know

691
00:33:16,346 --> 00:33:19,316 A:middle
that they favorited the toast.

692
00:33:19,316 --> 00:33:22,896 A:middle
So I am not going to go through
every single line of code here

693
00:33:22,896 --> 00:33:24,246 A:middle
because it's a little
bit longer,

694
00:33:24,246 --> 00:33:27,066 A:middle
and also my code is
a little bit messy,

695
00:33:27,066 --> 00:33:28,976 A:middle
and I guess that's the
point that I want to get

696
00:33:28,976 --> 00:33:32,736 A:middle
across is the fact that this
is not an engineering exercise.

697
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:36,396 A:middle
We really just want you
to hack it together.

698
00:33:36,436 --> 00:33:37,716 A:middle
I give you my full permission.

699
00:33:39,086 --> 00:33:43,736 A:middle
And secondly, really try and
use images wherever you can.

700
00:33:43,736 --> 00:33:45,436 A:middle
You will be amazed at
what you can get away

701
00:33:45,436 --> 00:33:47,206 A:middle
with with this sort of fakery.

702
00:33:47,206 --> 00:33:50,746 A:middle
And then thirdly, there
is a really nice suite

703
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:53,456 A:middle
of animation functions, which
you probably already know,

704
00:33:53,456 --> 00:33:57,316 A:middle
which is Animate with
Duration in the UIView class.

705
00:33:57,616 --> 00:33:59,416 A:middle
So here's our prototype.

706
00:33:59,676 --> 00:34:01,886 A:middle
We've got something we can
get someone to try out.

707

708
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

709
00:33:59,676 --> 00:34:01,886 A:middle
We've got something we can
get someone to try out.

710
00:34:02,536 --> 00:34:04,306 A:middle
So let's try it out on others.

711
00:34:04,306 --> 00:34:09,985 A:middle
So I took it to my next-door
neighbor, which coincidentally,

712
00:34:09,985 --> 00:34:12,036 A:middle
he's a massive toast fan,

713
00:34:12,036 --> 00:34:13,795 A:middle
so he was really
excited to try it out.

714
00:34:13,795 --> 00:34:18,295 A:middle
And he came back
with some concise

715
00:34:18,716 --> 00:34:20,116 A:middle
but very revealing feedback.

716
00:34:20,116 --> 00:34:24,626 A:middle
And that was, I really liked
how it felt, but surely,

717
00:34:24,726 --> 00:34:25,746 A:middle
shouldn't it be a swipe?

718
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,716 A:middle
Now, he's got a point here.

719
00:34:28,716 --> 00:34:30,706 A:middle
The animation even
goes off to the right.

720
00:34:30,706 --> 00:34:31,846 A:middle
It looks like a swipe.

721
00:34:31,846 --> 00:34:34,126 A:middle
And this is a really
good example

722
00:34:34,126 --> 00:34:37,516 A:middle
of how your outsider's opinion
can really give you these

723
00:34:37,516 --> 00:34:40,926 A:middle
insights of things that, in
hindsight, are really obvious,

724
00:34:40,926 --> 00:34:44,005 A:middle
but we just didn't see
it because we were too

725
00:34:44,186 --> 00:34:46,545 A:middle
in the process of the project.

726
00:34:46,896 --> 00:34:51,706 A:middle
So maybe he is alluding to
this nice animation in Mail

727
00:34:51,706 --> 00:34:54,255 A:middle
where you can swipe
to mark as Unread.

728
00:34:54,856 --> 00:34:57,036 A:middle
So let's try a swipe gesture.

729
00:34:57,616 --> 00:34:59,986 A:middle
Let's think of it in
terms of our start,

730

731
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

732
00:35:00,146 --> 00:35:01,686 A:middle
change, and complete model.

733
00:35:02,316 --> 00:35:05,696 A:middle
So in the start, we've
got the finger going down.

734
00:35:05,696 --> 00:35:07,916 A:middle
As the finger goes down, we need

735
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:10,066 A:middle
to determine whether the
user is trying to swipe

736
00:35:10,506 --> 00:35:12,926 A:middle
or whether they want
to scroll or just tap.

737
00:35:12,926 --> 00:35:16,396 A:middle
And the way we do this
really easily is we just look

738
00:35:16,396 --> 00:35:18,176 A:middle
at the initial movement
of the finger,

739
00:35:18,176 --> 00:35:22,346 A:middle
and if it moves far
enough horizontally

740
00:35:22,346 --> 00:35:24,336 A:middle
without moving too
much vertically,

741
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:25,676 A:middle
we know it's a swipe.

742
00:35:26,136 --> 00:35:28,776 A:middle
So essentially, we are
setting some sort of threshold.

743
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:31,346 A:middle
And only once a user has passed

744
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:34,686 A:middle
that threshold do we start
this connected behavior.

745
00:35:36,146 --> 00:35:38,296 A:middle
So now we are in
the change state,

746
00:35:38,296 --> 00:35:40,046 A:middle
where the user can
move this row.

747
00:35:40,726 --> 00:35:44,426 A:middle
Maybe we can prompt them
with a little message saying

748
00:35:44,426 --> 00:35:45,796 A:middle
if they carry on swiping,

749
00:35:45,796 --> 00:35:47,736 A:middle
then they are going
to favorite this row.

750
00:35:49,876 --> 00:35:52,556 A:middle
And so hopefully
intuitively they get the idea

751
00:35:52,556 --> 00:35:54,046 A:middle
that they can back
out at this stage

752
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:57,346 A:middle
by letting go or by moving back.

753
00:35:57,346 --> 00:35:59,776 A:middle
So this is what it would
look like on the phone.

754
00:35:59,776 --> 00:36:03,096 A:middle
And then finally, the complete.

755

756
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

757
00:35:59,776 --> 00:36:03,096 A:middle
And then finally, the complete.

758
00:36:03,506 --> 00:36:07,236 A:middle
If the user carries on swiping,
we need to make sure, again,

759
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:10,976 A:middle
they know that they
favorited this row.

760
00:36:10,976 --> 00:36:12,596 A:middle
So we've got our prototype.

761
00:36:12,706 --> 00:36:14,676 A:middle
I tried it out on my
next-door neighbor.

762
00:36:14,816 --> 00:36:16,876 A:middle
He seemed to really
like it, maybe partly

763
00:36:16,876 --> 00:36:20,426 A:middle
because it was his idea
in the first place.

764
00:36:20,426 --> 00:36:23,236 A:middle
And we are ready to
send it off to the CEO

765
00:36:23,456 --> 00:36:25,016 A:middle
to see what he thinks.

766
00:36:25,576 --> 00:36:29,886 A:middle
So he's usually quite quick
at getting back to us.

767
00:36:30,246 --> 00:36:31,926 A:middle
[Ding] Oh, there he is.

768
00:36:32,676 --> 00:36:34,016 A:middle
Hi, Marek.

769
00:36:34,016 --> 00:36:36,876 A:middle
Thirty seconds ago I decided to
turn my life around and switch

770
00:36:36,876 --> 00:36:39,896 A:middle
to a gluten-free paleo diet.

771
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:42,056 A:middle
I feel better already.

772
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:45,606 A:middle
The future is drinkable
meal replacements.

773
00:36:46,486 --> 00:36:49,146 A:middle
Now I don't even need to
leave my standing desk to eat.

774
00:36:49,816 --> 00:36:52,706 A:middle
I need a prototype
in 45 minutes.

775
00:36:52,706 --> 00:36:54,116 A:middle
Have a great weekend.

776
00:36:54,116 --> 00:36:56,166 A:middle
So of course, I am going
to have a great weekend.

777
00:36:57,246 --> 00:36:59,456 A:middle
Anyway, that's interactive
prototypes.

778

779
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

780
00:37:00,096 --> 00:37:03,576 A:middle
Hopefully now you can see
that it's really easy to test

781
00:37:03,576 --> 00:37:06,506 A:middle
out your animations before
you build out your whole app

782
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:09,656 A:middle
so that later on down the line
you are not going to get burnt.

783
00:37:09,656 --> 00:37:12,006 A:middle
I'm going to hand
you back to Julian

784
00:37:12,006 --> 00:37:13,666 A:middle
for a quick toast
mortem of the session.

785
00:37:14,516 --> 00:37:17,016 A:middle
[Applause]

786
00:37:17,516 --> 00:37:18,636 A:middle
>> JULIAN MISSIG:
Thank you, Marek.

787
00:37:19,246 --> 00:37:19,746 A:middle
Thank you, Marek.

788
00:37:21,246 --> 00:37:25,006 A:middle
So what did we learn
today about animation?

789
00:37:25,006 --> 00:37:29,996 A:middle
We learned that we can think of
animation as a change over time.

790
00:37:31,246 --> 00:37:35,636 A:middle
We still need to go back
and design our screens,

791
00:37:35,676 --> 00:37:38,196 A:middle
figure out what should be
on each screen if we run

792
00:37:38,196 --> 00:37:39,636 A:middle
into difficulty with
our animations.

793
00:37:41,516 --> 00:37:44,916 A:middle
The manner in which you change
over time can be thought

794
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:46,076 A:middle
of in two different ways.

795
00:37:46,606 --> 00:37:49,016 A:middle
It's both practical, it
communicates something

796
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,436 A:middle
about how all the different
parts of your app fit together.

797
00:37:52,106 --> 00:37:52,956 A:middle
And it's artful.

798
00:37:53,476 --> 00:37:55,566 A:middle
It tells you something
about the character

799
00:37:55,566 --> 00:37:59,056 A:middle
of your app, how it feels.

800

801
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

802
00:38:00,196 --> 00:38:04,326 A:middle
We have three different reasons
why we might want to animate.

803
00:38:04,326 --> 00:38:06,286 A:middle
We can animate to direct
people's attention.

804
00:38:07,446 --> 00:38:09,686 A:middle
We can animate to help
keep people oriented.

805
00:38:09,686 --> 00:38:13,936 A:middle
And we can animate to
connect people's behavior

806
00:38:13,936 --> 00:38:18,426 A:middle
to what's happening on screen.

807
00:38:19,116 --> 00:38:22,876 A:middle
We briefly touched on this
prototyping process we've

808
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:26,156 A:middle
described a couple of times
where we want to make a lot

809
00:38:26,156 --> 00:38:28,916 A:middle
of things so that we can
show people a lot of things,

810
00:38:29,336 --> 00:38:30,566 A:middle
so we can learn a lot of things.

811
00:38:31,646 --> 00:38:32,656 A:middle
The more that we can do this,

812
00:38:32,726 --> 00:38:35,506 A:middle
the more that we can learn
before we invest time and money

813
00:38:35,766 --> 00:38:37,736 A:middle
in building the real apps.

814
00:38:38,456 --> 00:38:42,076 A:middle
If you would like to learn more
about this prototyping process,

815
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:47,096 A:middle
there was a session at last
year's WWDC specifically

816
00:38:47,096 --> 00:38:47,886 A:middle
on prototyping.

817
00:38:48,806 --> 00:38:50,916 A:middle
And yesterday, there
was a session Designing

818
00:38:50,916 --> 00:38:53,646 A:middle
for Future Hardware, that
applies this prototyping process

819
00:38:54,156 --> 00:38:55,736 A:middle
to apps connected to devices.

820
00:38:56,446 --> 00:38:58,586 A:middle
Both of these should be
available in videos online.

821
00:38:59,706 --> 00:39:00,696 A:middle
You should certainly also check

822

823
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00,000

824
00:38:59,706 --> 00:39:00,696 A:middle
You should certainly also check

825
00:39:00,696 --> 00:39:03,876 A:middle
out all the other design
sessions for more information

826
00:39:03,876 --> 00:39:08,076 A:middle
on how you can be
designing all these screens.

827
00:39:09,726 --> 00:39:13,706 A:middle
But finally, we would like to
leave you with just one thought.

828
00:39:15,316 --> 00:39:20,876 A:middle
We want you to go out there and
use animation to add character

829
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:22,076 A:middle
to your apps and games.

830
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:28,986 A:middle
But please do so thoughtfully.

831
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:31,716 A:middle
The whole point of this is

832
00:39:31,716 --> 00:39:36,356 A:middle
that we can't understand what
the animation communicates

833
00:39:37,066 --> 00:39:39,556 A:middle
or how it feels without
trying it.

834
00:39:40,386 --> 00:39:43,336 A:middle
So find ways to try animations,
whatever those ways may be.

835
00:39:43,946 --> 00:39:44,386 A:middle
Thank you all.

836
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:49,500 A:middle
[Applause]

837
