Good morning everyone. Welcome to the Accelerate framework session.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
My name is Luke Chang; I'm an engineer in Vector and Numerics Group.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm here today to talk about [the] Accelerate framework.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Have you ever thought about making an image processing app? Or audio equalizer app? Or any computation intensive app?

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you have, you're in the right place.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Accelerate framework can help you make those apps, and more.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's why we would like to call it your "one-stop shopping" for fast and energy efficient libraries.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We call it one-stop shopping for a reason. In the Accelerate framework, we support a wide range of computational functionalities.
