1
00:00:10,372 --> 00:00:10,373
Hello everybody and welcome to WWDC 2012.

2
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:15,660
I'm very happy to be here and see you all here.

3
00:00:18,137 --> 00:00:19,551
It's a big room.

4
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:23,936
So, I hope you like what you saw this morning

5
00:00:23,936 --> 00:00:26,284
in the Keynote, there were lots of new announcements

6
00:00:26,284 --> 00:00:28,166
lots of new hardware.

7
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:31,510
The new MacBook Pro,wow!

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,464
A great machine

9
00:00:33,464 --> 00:00:41,510
We also announced a lot of new features in OSX

10
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,943
There was xxx new feature in OSX

11
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:46,634
And I'm not going to go through it again this afternoon

12
00:00:46,634 --> 00:00:52,369
But a lot of new features in Mountain Lion, the new OSX

13
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:55,779
Same thing with iOS, a lot of new features

14
00:00:55,779 --> 00:00:57,646
I think like 200 new features

15
00:00:57,646 --> 00:01:01,773
And here again, I'm not going to go through all the features

16
00:01:01,773 --> 00:01:03,878
Those are very great announcements

17
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:07,286
and I'm sure you're going to love those 2 OS's

18
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:08,767
So for you developers,

19
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:12,347
and I went through last time xxx one by one

20
00:01:12,347 --> 00:01:15,551
And there were more than 3000 new APIs

21
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:17,294
I stopped at 3000

22
00:01:17,294 --> 00:01:22,730
But there is like 3000 new APIs for you to discover

23
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,531
That is what this week is about

24
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:26,800
To dive into those new APIs

25
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,426
and learn, and see what you can use for your new product

26
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:36,592
Or when you update your current application

27
00:01:36,592 --> 00:01:44,650
So with iOS and OSX, we have 2 huge ecosystems

28
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:50,370
Ecosystems built on top of the 2 leading platforms in the industry

29
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,937
At Apple, we care about the complete experience from end to end

30
00:01:54,937 --> 00:01:58,763
So we care about the hardware, the software, the services

31
00:01:58,763 --> 00:02:01,655
The content, and even the accessories

32
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:08,484
We want the user to experience the full experience from end to end

33
00:02:08,484 --> 00:02:11,356
You developers are also part in this ecosystem

34
00:02:11,356 --> 00:02:13,674
You're taking advantage of this huge ecosystem

35
00:02:13,674 --> 00:02:17,727
to be able to sell your application to lots of customers

36
00:02:17,727 --> 00:02:20,864
And so you are improving our ecosystem

37
00:02:20,864 --> 00:02:26,115
and you are helping us to be so successful.

38
00:02:26,115 --> 00:02:29,323
Some numbers were shown this morning

39
00:02:29,323 --> 00:02:32,717
650,000 apps -- that's huge

40
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:35,768
I've been at Apple for more than 20 years

41
00:02:35,768 --> 00:02:39,183
and believe me, this is huge

42
00:02:39,183 --> 00:02:44,295
30 billion downloads -- that's also a humongous number

43
00:02:44,295 --> 00:02:48,568
And 400 million Store Accounts

44
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:53,680
That's 400 million potential customers for your application

45
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,288
So a lot of customers

46
00:02:56,288 --> 00:02:58,688
So, what you're going to do this afternoon

47
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,163
is step back a little bit

48
00:03:01,163 --> 00:03:04,263
We want to give you 10 actual items

49
00:03:04,263 --> 00:03:07,301
10 things that you should be doing in your next application

50
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:10,555
or when you upgrade your current application

51
00:03:10,555 --> 00:03:13,102
10 things that we really care about

52
00:03:13,102 --> 00:03:14,760
because we are spending a lot of resources,

53
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,922
a lot of time, a lot of effort on

54
00:03:16,922 --> 00:03:21,135
And our customers want those things to be in your application

55
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:24,799
So we're going to go through those 10 action items

56
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,516
Take notes, there's going to be a quiz at the end

57
00:03:28,516 --> 00:03:31,878
So let's start

58
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,599
Number 1: Design

59
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,399
So design is something we deeply care about here at Apple

60
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:42,509
In our hardware, in our software

61
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:44,385
Design is part of our DNA

62
00:03:44,385 --> 00:03:47,507
We spend a lot of time designing our applications

63
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:48,972
designing our hardware

64
00:03:48,972 --> 00:03:51,880
This is what we are all about

65
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,935
So for you developers, how does it start?

66
00:03:53,935 --> 00:03:55,289
It starts with this big idea

67
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:57,664
"Oh my God, this big idea is going to be fantastic"

68
00:03:57,664 --> 00:04:02,539
and -<i>woof</i>- you go and start typing code and writing code

69
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:05,843
And there is a big missing step here

70
00:04:05,843 --> 00:04:10,842
You have to look at the design of your application

71
00:04:10,842 --> 00:04:12,429
There is a famous quote that says

72
00:04:12,429 --> 00:04:16,955
"Genius is 1% inspiration, and 99% perspiration"

73
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:19,629
For you, the idea is really the 1% here

74
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:21,354
The rest is how you're going to deliver

75
00:04:21,354 --> 00:04:22,955
your idea to your customers

76
00:04:22,955 --> 00:04:25,760
This is what's important

77
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,439
So, design -- what is this about?

78
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:31,912
We can define 3 types of design

79
00:04:31,912 --> 00:04:33,705
There is the Interaction design

80
00:04:33,705 --> 00:04:35,328
The Implementation design

81
00:04:35,328 --> 00:04:37,140
and the Visual design

82
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,765
And they are not 3 steps that you can do 1, 2, 3 and you're done

83
00:04:39,765 --> 00:04:41,593
and move on

84
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:45,521
They all -- this is something that's going to evolve during the lifetime

85
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:47,485
during your development cycle

86
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:51,485
And they are all interacting with each other

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Your change in interaction design is going to change your implementation obviously, and it may change your visual.

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So they are all working dependent on each other, and you have to constantly make them evolve.

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's describe briefly what I mean here.

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The interaction design is all about shaping your application for people use.

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It means making it efficient, engaging, intuitive.

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you know the expression "Look and feel" - it's about the "feel" in "look and feel".

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You don't want your user to have to read a 300 pages manual.

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's obvious, but ????????

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We have great documentation at Apple with User Interface Guidelines - one for OS X and one for iOS.

96
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because the interaction is obviously not exactly the same.

97
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, read these documents. It's a most mandatory for you to read these documents.

98
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Spend time understanding how you can implement the best interaction possible.

99
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The single(?) type of design certain aspect of design is the implementation design.

100
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And here I'm sure there are a lot of engineers in this room today. This is probably where you're gonna be spending most of your time.

101
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is about finding the right technology for your idea, the right architecture and the feature set.

102
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Looking at performance, plan for your resources - the people, the time.

103
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
All those things that are key to be successful.

104
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's also the time to make the right trade-offs.

105
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You may have this grandiose idea, but it turns out that, you know, the technology is not there, or you don't have time to do it so.

106
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the time to figure out, what you can do in the time you have to go to market.

107
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Finally, the visual design. This is about making your application beautiful and unique.

108
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Giving the perfect experience to your customers.

109
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is about choosing the visual elements that are going to make your application unique.

110
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The right typography, the right colour, the right patterns.

111
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Everything that's going to make a memorable experience.

112
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, may sound obvious but you need to think about these things.

113
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And figure out if you are going through this whole cycle for your application.

114
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Skipping (?) on design - you wan't get what you want at the end.

115
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You may have this great idea - but you wan't have any success.

116
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is about design. Your first action item - don't skip on design.

117
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The number two action item is about iCloud.

118
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So iCloud is Apple cloud service. The idea is very simple.

119
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We want our customer to have all their documents, all their stuff up in the cloud.

120
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And they can access it wirelessly anywhere on any devices.

121
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's the goal of iCloud.

122
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
iCloud was introduced last year. It's integrated in OS X and iOS. It's a free service.

123
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And it's simple and easy for our users to use.

124
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
As I said we are integrating iCloud in all our applications and services.

125
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
On iOS it is in Mail, Calendar, Address book. It's in Backup.

126
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's in the store, in the music store. We announced the new share photo stream.

127
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's in the iMessage. So we are including iCloud everywhere.

128
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And on both iOS and OS X.

129
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
As of March of 2012 we had 125 Million iCloud users.
