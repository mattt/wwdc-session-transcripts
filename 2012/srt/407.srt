00:00:10,547 --> 00:00:12,417
My name is Joshua Pennington

2
00:00:12,417 --> 00:00:14,999
and I'm an engineer on the
Interface Builder Team

3
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,748
Today we're going to talk about

4
00:00:16,748 --> 00:00:19,289
how you can adopt Storyboards
in your app.

5
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:22,029
We're going to cover a couple topics today.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,942
We're going to start by giving
a quick overview of Storyboards.

7
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:30,327
Then my colleague Tony is going to
come up here and talk about

8
00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:34,418
how you can adopt Storyboards in
applications that use code or xibs

9
00:00:35,713 --> 00:00:39,359
And I'm going to finish by talking about
some great new features for Storyboards

10
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:40,509
in iOS 6.

11
00:00:41,946 --> 00:00:43,234
Let's start with the basics.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is a Storyboard.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This Storyboard allows to view you app's
entire user interface in one place.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you can also view the transitions
between parts of your application

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so you can very quickly get an overview
of the application just by glancing at it.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And there are two main concepts
in a Storyboard.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The first concept if that of a "scene".

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A scene is a view controller, and it can
represent an entire screen in your app

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or just one major component area, like a
split view pane

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and a split view controller on iPad.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you can drag in views, you can select
things and resize them.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You can inspect your attributes
in the inspector.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
All of the normal interface builder
affordances are present here.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is where you're gonna spend
most of your time fleshing out the UI

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of your application.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's the first concept:
the scene.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The second concept if that
of a "segue".

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A segue defines navigation in your
Storyboard.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
