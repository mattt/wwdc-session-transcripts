99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Good morning.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
My name is Brian Tucker, and I am a manager in the iOS software engineering group.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Primarily I'm responsible pretty much for all Bluetooth technologies on iOS platforms.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is Core Bluetooth 101, this is not basket weaving.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you were looking for that, you're in the wrong room.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Core Bluetooth 101, primarily an API that focuses on Bluetooth Low Energy,

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which is a new technology that was ratified by the Bluetooth Standards bodies.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I believe at the end of 2010. It was introduced in our products last year with iOS 5 and the iPhone 4S.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And - why do we think it's important to talk about this technology?

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, I think that low energy - in the sense of low energy, if you look at the technology perspective -

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
really applies to every single person in this room as a consumer,

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but especially as a technologist.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll give you an example:

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I was in China earlier this year, and had the opportunity to speak on this topic in China

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in front of about 2000 people.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And in China of course you have translators.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I had never spoken to a group of people with translators before.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They were sitting over there in this booth,

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and they had picked somebody in the front row to tell me when to slow down.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because when you speak fast, the translators are like machines

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this stuff is just flying out of their mouth.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So you have this guy in the front who was flashing this flashlight at me

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- he'd flash the flashlight when I was talking too fast.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm watching my timer and I know how many slides I have left

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I realize there's no way I'm going to get through these slides.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I look at him and he looks at me and we have this showdown

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and he realizes I'm not going to slow down.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So at any moment I'm pretty sure he's going to throw the flashlight at me.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But we get through it, get done on time

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and all the slides got done

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I'm sure the translators are ready to shoot me.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I walk down and I see the translators are running across the stage at me.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I'm like here it is, I'm going to get killed.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Instead he comes up to me and says,

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"That was amazing!"

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I'm like, "what?"

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And he's like, "I've never talked that fast in my life!"

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
He said, "I'm gonna go home today and start working on this technology!"
