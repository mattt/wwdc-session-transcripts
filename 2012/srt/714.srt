00:00:11,258 --> 00:00:14,121
Good Morning and Welcome to Session 714

2
00:00:14,936 --> 00:00:18,043
For the next hour, myself and my
colleagues Conrad and Michael

3
00:00:18,517 --> 00:00:20,955
are going to be talking about
protecting the user's data,

4
00:00:21,427 --> 00:00:24,400
and the part that you, the developers,
can play in that.

5
00:00:25,982 --> 00:00:27,790
First of all, a little bit about ourselves.

6
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:30,937
We are all members of the
platform security team at Apple

7
00:00:31,508 --> 00:00:33,534
and we really operate up
and down the stack,

8
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:35,581
all the way down from
the secure bootloader,

9
00:00:36,306 --> 00:00:38,596
all the way up to applications
and even the cloud.

10
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:41,333
But some times that we are always involved

11
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:44,102
is when a cryptographic key is used

12
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,438
to protect user's data.

13
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:48,876
That's technologies you've probably
come across before.

14
00:00:51,254 --> 00:00:54,179
We also design and build solutions
for internal clients

15
00:00:54,735 --> 00:00:58,789
For example, we were involved with
designing the cryptography
used by iMessage.

16
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:03,308
We expose a lot of that functionality,

17
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:04,466
through third partâ€”

18
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,085
APIs for use by third parties
such as yourselves;

19
00:01:07,312 --> 00:01:10,804
Security.framework, CommonCrypto
being examples.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That functionality is also exposed

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
by other Apple APIs at an even higher level,

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for example, NSFileManager, CFNetwork,

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we're going to be pulling

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
from both of those layers

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
during this presentation.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What we're going to talk about:

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're going to look at a common situation,

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which is a client app talking to
a web service.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're going to subject it to
a hostile environment,

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a simulated attack, and show what can happen,

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
talk about why that matters, and give some

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
simple steps that you can put
in your applications

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to avoid falling foul of such attacks.
