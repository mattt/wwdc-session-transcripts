# WWDC Session Transcripts

As used by [ASCIIwwdc](http://asciiwwdc.com).

## Methodology

A session's transcript can be concatenated via HLS playlists or fetched directly from a conventional URL. Transcripts [have been](tools) and [can be](https://github.com/rlwimi/jonyfive) fetched. Apple occasionally improves the transcriptions.

Found a mistake? Apple does improve the captions, given feedback. Give feedback directly to Apple through the [WWDC app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wwdc/id640199958?mt=8). It's just like [filing radars](https://blackpixel.com/writing/2012/02/radar-or-gtfo.html). You can also open a pull request here.

Apple has not captioned 2012 sessions. Additional transcripts for 2012 WWDC content were graciously contributed by [Rev.com](http://www.rev.com/) and [community volunteers](https://github.com/mattt/wwdc-session-transcripts/graphs/contributors).
