00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:13,200
>> Graeme: Welcome to the second session on
Game Design and Development for the iPhone OS.

1
2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,100
In, well, I really hope you attended Part One.

2
3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,510
Did you all attend Part One?

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,040
[ Applause ]

4
5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,430
Good game designers.

5
6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,710
This session is all about the technical
aspects of how we made Quest and we're going

6
7
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,890
to go a lot into optimizing for the platforms.

7
8
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,530
As I said in the first session there is
more than one platform now and optimizing

8
9
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,520
for each of them requires a little thought.

9
10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,120
We're going to talk about that.

10
11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,590
We're going to talk about our lighting
algorithm and how we lit the dungeon

11
12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,550
and how we actually got to 30 fps and higher.

12
13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,790
Our game actually runs at a high frame rate.

13
14
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,290
We're going to take a, check in with our art department.

14
15
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:57,650
Pete will talk about the artwork at Quest and how the
art pipeline even made a tremendous difference in getting

15
16
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,060
to the higher frame rates that we see in the game.

16
17
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:06,850
Finally we're going to talk about the one dozen things
that we think will make a tremendous difference to you

17
18
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:12,160
in your game development and hopefully you'll
get to apply some of that tonight to your games

18
19
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,120
so you can talk to us about it in our labs tomorrow.

19
20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:25,170
So to quickly reiterate Quest was written in two months by
three programmers and one artist who really were passionate

20
21
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:35,230
about making a highly performing application to
show off on the iPad, the iPod Touch and the iPhone.

21
22
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,840
Let's have another quick demo, take
a look technically at some stuff.

22
23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,910
I'd like to invite Jeff to the stage
for a little talk through that.

23
24
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,140
[ Applause ]

24
25
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,670
>> Jeff: So this demo will be more of a technical
programmer look at it, sort of look behind the curtain.

25
26
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:57,240
So, what you see here is our dungeon level
exported via Open Collada from our 3D art package.

26
27
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:05,580
You see in this frame as you, it varies as he runs
around but it's around 45 to 50,000 polygons a frame

27
28
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:11,180
and we should be doing around 40 frames a second
so go ahead and bring up the console and change

28
29
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:17,150
to the perf
display so we can see what's going on,

29
30
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,640
50 and 45 so you know you can do the
math and we're pushing lots of polygons.

30
31
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,380
These devices are super awesome.

31
32
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:32,920
This is an iPad running 1024x768 and
pushing tons and tons of polygons.

32
33
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,940
It was so much fun making this game
on the iPad and on the iPhone 4.

33
34
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,410
These devices are just awesome to play with.

34
35
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,830
So we can see he's going through the light and we'll talk

35
36
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,120
about how we do the per pixel lighting here.

36
37
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,930
We'll show you the shader that did that but as
you've seen us kill the demon over and over again,

37
38
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,760
there's been some stuff that's been bothering
me so let's just go kill the demon real quick

38
39
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,840
and kind of describe what the problem is.

39
40
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,190
So as he's fighting you can kind of see that the hero is
way up in the demon's kitchen a little bit like we need to

40
41
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,960
[ Laughter ]

41
42
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,930
We need to back him out.

42
43
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,100
I mean the demon is just engulfing him right?

43
44
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,280
So one way we can do that is bring up the
console and we can change the runtime,

44
45
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,080
the character collision radius of the hero.

45
46
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:27,410
By default it is 100 world units so if we
back that out a little bit, let's say 150

46
47
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:32,200
and we fight again, we can kind of see the instant change.

47
48
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,040
So it's better.

48
49
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,190
Nice crit.

49
50
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,250
But still, still let's back it out.

50
51
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,180
Let's try 200.

51
52
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:50,760
So as you can see we're changing variables
in real time without doing another build.

52
53
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,790
We're on device and we're making
this loop as tight as we can.

53
54
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,700
We can change as fast as we can.

54
55
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,150
So let's see how that looks.

55
56
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,440
Alright that looks a little bit better.

56
57
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,970
That looks I would send that out the door.

57
58
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,130
Alright. OK one, a couple more things I want

58
59
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:14,660
to show you before we leave this demo
is let's show you the facade of Quest.

59
60
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,510
So, let's turn on rotation.

60
61
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,820
Let's kind of rotate around the dungeon a little bit.

61
62
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,950
Toggle rotation.

62
63
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:28,890
This is the part where you don't want to run over
and grab it from him and start typing it yourself.

63
64
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:34,540
So as we rotate around you can kind of see we don't have any
polygons where you can't see from our default camera view.

64
65
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,760
We don't have anything down the stairs.

65
66
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,700
We don't have anything behind the
hall of lights for example.

66
67
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:46,170
We cut out everything that the camera won't see
as a final post process to help our frame rate.

67
68
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,820
We don't need to render triangles that you're never seeing.

68
69
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,560
You know, it's a game.

69
70
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,490
It's a Hollywood set.

70
71
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,120
We don't, we're not making the most realistic dungeon.

71
72
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:01,030
I've never seen a real dungeon so it's
fake and now we're showing how we cheat

72
73
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:08,270
and as a final step let's turn off the diffuse map
because we're going to show off lighting right away.

73
74
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,590
So this is our lightmap for the dungeon.

74
75
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:25,120
You can see as he walks this lightmap is shading our
guy so as he walks through the red, you see it gets red

75
76
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:33,500
and as he walks out of the red he doesn't and
so we'll go into how we made this lightmap next.

76
77
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,160
[ Applause ]

77
78
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,330
So, OK. First quiz of the day.

78
79
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:47,450
How many people here see this and
see 10 lights in the scene?

79
80
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:52,550
10? Alright, how about choice of B, how about 20?

80
81
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,800
Couple? Alright.

81
82
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,140
How about multiple choice C, which is always correct, 0?

82
83
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,770
How many people see 0 lights in the scene?

83
84
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:04,320
Alright. Yes and then the final D
answer to throw you all off, 50.

84
85
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,400
Anybody see 50?

85
86
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,800
Yes. Alright.

86
87
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,780
Everyone's correct.

87
88
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,380
So what we do in Quest is we lighten up our dungeon.

88
89
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:18,770
We start off with our diffuse map which is just
our detail and our base color and then we go

89
90
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,650
into our art package and we put in lots and lots of lights.

90
91
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,240
Static lights.

91
92
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,750
In this scene we have over 50 static lights so
if you raised your hand on D, you were correct.

92
93
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,270
But we also have no dynamic lights so
if you chose 0 you are also correct.

93
94
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:39,780
Our first pass at this was your standard take
your diffuse, multiply it times the lightmap

94
95
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,700
and you get this result and it was muddy.

95
96
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:50,000
Our artist Pete looked at it and he said yeah
that's great but it doesn't look very good so he

96
97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,560
and he said what I want is the
hard light shader from Photoshop.

97
98
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:02,640
I want the shadows to be darker and I want the highlights of
the frame to be brighter and so, you know, I'm a programmer.

98
99
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,570
I know math.

99
100
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,370
I'm like yeah and I have shaders.

100
101
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,320
Let's do it in a shader, you know.

101
102
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,960
Let me go look up the hardlight math and put it all
in the shader because shaders solve all problems.

102
103
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,550
So we did that.

103
104
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,650
Looks great, 12 frames a second.

104
105
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,000
It was terrible.

105
106
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,340
It was very, very slow.

106
107
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,650
So not only do we have.

107
108
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,340
We have two problems now.

108
109
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:33,050
We have one, we have an unhappy artist because it's slow and
we've also taken all the power out of our, out of his hand.

109
110
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,180
He doesn't have any control over the final frame any more.

110
111
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,450
We do all the fancy math in the shader.

111
112
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:45,000
So, we needed to go back to the drawing board
and kind of think of a different way to do this.

112
113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,500
So, one way to do this was to pre-compute
what the hardlight does ahead of time.

113
114
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:55,920
What we did is we pre-computed the brightening part of
the hardlight shader in the diffuse map ahead of time

114
115
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:01,940
and then we do our final multiply with the
lightmap and our dungeon is now fast again,

115
116
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,580
running very, very fast using a very simple shader.

116
117
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,080
So we're now fast and we also have
the power back in the artist's hands.

117
118
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,240
He now controls both sides of the equation.

118
119
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,930
He can brighten up the lightmap, the diffuse map in
Photoshop, he can level it, and he can saturate it.

119
120
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:24,670
It's up to him and then he also generates
the lightmap for us and we just render it.

120
121
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:29,930
So here's the hardlight textbook version of the fragment
shader that was super slow and I'll kind of walk you

121
122
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:34,660
through it and it's going to take a long
time because it's a very, very slow shader.

122
123
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:38,580
First we sampled the diffuse map and scale it.

123
124
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:44,080
Then we sampled the lightmap and then we
start messing with the diffuse color -1

124
125
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,330
so we get it from the range of 0 to 1 to -1 to 1.

125
126
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:55,400
Next we have to start prepping the left and right sides of
the equation for our mix and then we figure out our step

126
127
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,800
and then we do our mix and we finally step on the FragColor

127
128
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:05,320
and you know the vertex shader is probably still rendering
them even though I've taken this long to explain it

128
129
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:13,240
and as a final don't do this ever, you can see that
in all these vec4's there are no precision qualifiers.

129
130
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,440
There's no lowp or mediump or highp anywhere in the shader

130
131
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,910
so we've given the shader compiler nothing
to go on to help optimize it for us.

131
132
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,120
So, what you see is what you get, very, very slow here.

132
133
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,980
Here's the final fragment shader.

133
134
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:36,720
It's your standard lightmapping shader, sample
and diffuse multiply it times the lightmap,

134
135
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,970
stuff it in the fragment color and you're off and running.

135
136
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:47,770
So now that we have the dungeon lit
how do we load it in, in a fast way.

136
137
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:54,500
The first version we tried was let's do the first
very naive way to do it, load it all in at once.

137
138
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:02,350
So what you see here is our top down or 3/4 view of the
dungeon and this was maybe 130,000 polygons at once.

138
139
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,370
This final version I think ended
up to be about 85,000 polygons.

139
140
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:06,840
So we did that.

140
141
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,380
We did the first thing which was a very quick thing to do.

141
142
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:14,420
We wanted to iterate as fast as we could so we loaded
it all up in memory and that caused a big problem.

142
143
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:22,280
It took 5 or 6 seconds to get to that Play button so we've
already broken that rule of getting to game play as fast

143
144
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:27,350
as we can so we needed to come up with a different way.

144
145
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,510
The way we finally ended up doing it
is we split it into logical sections.

145
146
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,640
The first thing we load is just
what you see at the main menu.

146
147
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,050
Then as you walk down the hallway we
start pulling those objects back in.

147
148
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:45,420
Now this also helped us be a good citizen
in Open jail because there is a limit

148
149
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,650
on how many triangles that you can index per 1 drawl call.

149
150
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:58,590
So breaking this up into logical sections got us
around that and then finally, look at your game design

150
151
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,430
and think about ways you can optimize your level loading.

151
152
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:05,540
For example, in Quest, we didn't end up doing
this but we could have if we had designed one

152
153
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,330
of those gates to shut after you walk through.

153
154
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,600
You reach a checkpoint and the gate shuts behind you.

154
155
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,710
You know you consider dropping off the first two sections.

155
156
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,430
You don't need that any more.

156
157
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:18,450
You might need the memory for particles
and all sorts of fun stuff.

157
158
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:24,610
So, drop those old sections if you can but the
main takeaway is, think about your game design

158
159
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,860
and what about your game design can allow
you to take these shortcuts you know.

159
160
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,590
You're making a game.

160
161
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:36,190
This is the best and most fun thing you can do as a
programmer is find those shortcuts and exploit them.

161
162
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:44,500
Finally, this is the part of the geometry that you don't
see in a game because given our camera point of view

162
163
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:49,530
and you don't rotate in our game play, you'd
never see these triangles so we never export them.

163
164
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,510
They're never in our binary.

164
165
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,740
It makes it small over.

165
166
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,890
It's faster to load.

166
167
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:59,080
Another important thing is we keep this around
on the art side because we use these polygons

167
168
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,570
to cast shadows and generate the lightmap.

168
169
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,500
So don't delete them entirely.

169
170
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,690
Keep them on the art side of the design side because
you might need to use them for some use later.

170
171
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:15,900
So, now that we've got the dungeon lit and
we're loading it let's throw the character in.

171
172
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,350
Our first pass at this was not good.

172
173
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,970
We threw down the guy.

173
174
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:23,440
He's got a diffuse texture, no shadow.

174
175
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,970
He sticks out like a sore thumb, doesn't look like he
fits at all but we also have another bigger problem

175
176
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,720
which is well we chose to statically
light our dungeon with no dynamic lights.

176
177
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:40,150
How are we going to light this guy so that
he fits in our world in a fast way given

177
178
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,970
that we've already chosen to take
static lighting into account?

178
179
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:48,740
One way you can do it is to take the minimap and drape
it over him as an environment map so as he's walking

179
180
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:54,220
around you know where he's in world space on the
minimap because you already done that for the game,

180
181
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,210
so you sample the texture and then you think well,

181
182
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:02,280
we're just going to distend our
lightmapping algorithm as he walks around.

182
183
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,820
This worked great and when we first thought of it we were

183
184
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,200
like you know it's not accurate
but it's going to look pretty good.

184
185
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,200
It will keep our frame rate pretty
high and it's going to be fun.

185
186
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,060
Right. It'll be fun enough.

186
187
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,570
So this worked great for about a second.

187
188
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:22,580
Right. You can see as we walked over that beautiful
grate that has light underneath it shining up,

188
189
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,550
he's now being shadowed by something
he's standing on top of.

189
190
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,360
Yeah. I laughed.

190
191
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:33,480
It was a good laugh but I also felt pretty stupid but
I knew I was on the right path because it looked cool

191
192
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,510
but something was; it just needed an extra little step.

192
193
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,590
So as I said being a game programmer
we can take some shortcuts here.

193
194
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,390
We're going to fake it.

194
195
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,870
We're going to not use the actual 1024x1024 minimap.

195
196
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:51,130
We're going to make a new one and this time
when we generate this lightmap we're not going

196
197
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,320
to take any information that's below his knees.

197
198
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,030
We're just going to take any light that's
above him because that's what we really want.

198
199
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:04,630
We really just want the lights from above him to shine and
we don't, our camera view we'll never see underneath him.

199
200
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:11,450
So this is the final lightmap that we
came up with and this is the final render.

200
201
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:17,040
Now when he was walking down the hall of lights and he was
all red and he walked into the darkness and it looked cool

201
202
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,740
but he was, he got kind of chameleoned into the background.

202
203
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,210
We lost him in the frame.

203
204
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:29,600
Now when he was moving it's easier to see but if you take
a screenshot and you send out a mail, people look at it

204
205
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,820
and they go well, yeah, he's shadowed but I can't see him.

205
206
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:39,950
One way to make him pop off the screen
is to add one dynamic rim light.

206
207
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:45,860
Now a rim light is one that we put on
the camera and we wanted the effect

207
208
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:51,200
of if the vertex normal is exactly perpendicular
to our camera, we want that to be fully bright

208
209
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,620
and as the vertex normal gets closer and closer
to the camera we want that to fall off to 0.

209
210
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,720
You can see that on the demon's shoulder.

210
211
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,430
The back of his shoulder is our fully bright value and then
as it gets closer and closer to the camera, it falls off.

211
212
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:08,360
So here's how we did that in the vertex shader.

212
213
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,880
First we set up a varying.

213
214
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:18,280
We need a place to store our result value and then
we get the normal from the camera to the vertex,

214
215
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,120
dot it with the vertex normal and then we smoothstep it.

215
216
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:29,410
Smoothstepping is basically a nice little quadratic blend
that we wanted to do between values between .5 and 1

216
217
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:34,230
and that final rim value you stuff into that
varying that we created at the very top.

217
218
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:42,450
Now as an exercise for you guys, this is a great place
to stop and think can I give my artist a knob here

218
219
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,620
to turn because artists love knobs to turn.

219
220
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,440
They love it.

220
221
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,520
Give them as many knobs and things to play with as possible.

221
222
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:55,970
So one way you can give an artist some love here
is to add an attribute called rim light color.

222
223
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:03,960
Let them set the color in your 3D world so that when they're
walking down the red hall of lights maybe he wants the light

223
224
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,920
to be tinted a little orange, blue, or whatever.

224
225
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,590
It's up to him right he's the artist.

225
226
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:13,330
Or another way you might want to
use this is in a very dramatic way.

226
227
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:17,360
If we roll a critten
and the hero hits the demon for that frame

227
228
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,840
and for the next few frames we can pump that red to
be fully red I mean pump that light to be fully red

228
229
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,030
and you know he'll flash red for a
second and it'll be you know dramatic.

229
230
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,730
So there's ways that you can play with this.

230
231
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,520
This is just the base case.

231
232
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,380
So we send that rim light over to
the fragment shader and you can see

232
233
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,440
that this fragment shader looks a
lot like our dungeon fragment shader.

233
234
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,410
Sample the diffuse multiply it times a
lightmap and simply add in the rim light

234
235
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,450
and then stuff it in the fragment color and you're off.

235
236
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:50,420
Let's talk about how we animated our guy.

236
237
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,920
There are two types of animations we considered.

237
238
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,980
We could have done skeletal animation or mesh animation.

238
239
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,370
Mesh animation is one of the older
techniques where at every key frame

239
240
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,900
in the animation you record the position of every vertex.

240
241
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:15,090
Given that our guy when we started was 3200 polygons
that information gets big fast, on disk and in RAM.

241
242
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,010
So we chose skeletal animation.

242
243
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:20,480
Skeletal animation is simply what you see here.

243
244
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:28,840
This stack of bones which is our matrix transformations and
then you also have a mapping of every vertex to each bone

244
245
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,960
or maybe a vertex matched to multiple bones.

245
246
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:38,900
For example if you have an elbow, this vertex on your elbow
might map to the lower arm and the upper arm equally 50%.

246
247
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,760
So you have this mapping and then when you
animate the bones because in your animation

247
248
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:51,040
for every key frame you're only storing the
bone transformations you then can draw your guy

248
249
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,660
and it looks correct.

249
250
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,990
So we chose skeletal.

250
251
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,190
Now there's two ways that you can
do this in a performant way.

251
252
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,660
The first way you should choose is you should look
at the GPU first because the GPU is very, very fast.

252
253
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,580
There are some tradeoffs to using the GPU though.

253
254
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:12,020
Let's say that your game is pegging the GPU fully, you have
no space left and but you still want to do some skinning so

254
255
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,980
but then you look at your CPU and you're
like oh look I have some space there.

255
256
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,030
Consider moving it back to the CPU.

256
257
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,480
You have two there you get to play with.

257
258
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,380
It's a balancing act.

258
259
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:28,810
Another reason you might want to do it on the CPU is
if you need at any time to know the vertex position

259
260
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,190
in the middle of the animation for, like in the swing.

260
261
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:36,270
If you even know that vertex position exactly you need
to do that on the CPU because once you send the GPU

261
262
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:40,010
down to render your stuff it's, you can't
get that back in any sort of performant way.

262
263
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,490
So it's a mix and match.

263
264
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,000
It's a game.

264
265
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,100
It's a game within a game.

265
266
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:51,390
So as I said before our first Sergeant Shock was one
that we made just to get in the game as fast as possible.

266
267
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:57,290
It had 3200ish polygons, 60 bones, tongue bone, eyelid bone.

267
268
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:02,060
I mean it was a lot right; 4 weights per vertex.

268
269
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:05,610
It was just done to get him in the game as fast as possible.

269
270
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:09,850
Now from our camera view there's really
no difference between a 60-bone guy

270
271
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:14,750
with 4 weights per vertex and a 2
weights per vertex, 20-bone guy.

271
272
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:21,030
There was no visual quality difference so
making that optimization was a great win for us.

272
273
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:25,140
Do less, your game will run faster.

273
274
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,840
It works for Quest but it might not work for your
game because you're doing a first-person shooter.

274
275
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,980
One solution does not fit all here.

275
276
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:39,550
It's up to you to test, play-test, redo the art assets again
and again and again until you find one that works for you.

276
277
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:43,130
Alright. Let's get to the console.

277
278
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:51,620
A typical game loop that I've been involved in and guilty of
is a designer will come to me, you know or Graeme will come

278
279
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,820
to me and say let's make the hero 100 HitPoints.

279
280
00:19:54,820 --> 00:20:02,890
I'll be just typing away in my, making my best
feature ever, I'm like yeah, yeah I'll do it.

280
281
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:12,070
Then I go to lunch and then I'll go to the bathroom and
I'll go to the meeting, I'll forget about it you know.

281
282
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,830
I'll finally make him a build.

282
283
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,930
A couple hours later I finally give it to him.

283
284
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:18,920
He plays it.

284
285
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,780
He's like ah you know what 100 is not fun.

285
286
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,440
Let's make it 200.

286
287
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:28,590
By that time I've gone to bed and he's still late at the
office and he'll send the email and the loop just continues.

287
288
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,810
The loop is very, very slow.

288
289
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:35,560
The best way that we've found to manufacture
fun is to make that loop as tight as possible.

289
290
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:40,590
Stay on device in game like we showed in the demo.

290
291
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,320
So here's the fastest way to do it.

291
292
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:49,580
Designer sets it to be 100 in game, he play-tests
right there on the device, changes it to 200

292
293
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,040
and does it again and again and again and again.

293
294
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,330
One way you can do this is to data drive your engine.

294
295
00:20:54,330 --> 00:21:00,190
Expose as many knobs and variables as you can to your
designer, to your artist, to your other programmers.

295
296
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:04,690
Now we've chosen to use the game console as the throwback.

296
297
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:08,590
There's many ways that you can
expose variables to your designers.

297
298
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,050
This is just one example.

298
299
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,470
Here's how we did it in code.

299
300
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,100
So this is one type of way you can do it.

300
301
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,710
You can say at the start of time you
can say addConfigVariable heroHitPoints

301
302
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,350
with a default value of 100 and a callback.

302
303
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:26,260
So when they bring up the console, type in
heroHitPoints = 100, you get this callback.

303
304
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:26,860
You get the value.

304
305
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,530
You can do whatever you want with it.

305
306
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,160
You can log it.

306
307
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,900
You can set the heroHitPoints to 100.

307
308
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,970
It's up to you.

308
309
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,210
Another pattern is to use a console command.

309
310
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,600
Console command is one it's just like a
variable but it doesn't really have a value.

310
311
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,920
So for example, like the toggle diffuse that you saw.

311
312
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,230
ToggleBBox here.

312
313
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:49,260
AddConsoleCommand toggleBBox withCallback and then

313
314
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,980
when they toggle the BBox you get the
callback and you can do whatever you want.

314
315
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,870
You can toggle your BBox rendering
or you can reload your assets.

315
316
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,350
You can do whatever you want.

316
317
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:06,220
But the point is that you are in
game and not reloading the game.

317
318
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,770
Here's one I like to use a lot.

318
319
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:14,560
Let's say that you get inspired one night and you start
working all night long and you've got this awesome feature

319
320
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,300
that you're going to do, 6:00 a.m. you're done.

320
321
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,010
Checking all your stuff, send out
the build email, all proud.

321
322
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:21,840
Check out my new feature.

322
323
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,850
This is awesome.

323
324
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,380
I'm going to bed.

324
325
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,800
Come in at 2:00.

325
326
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,090
Find out that you broke it.

326
327
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:27,990
You didn't check for an all.

327
328
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:32,230
You didn't, something's wrong and now you're the goat.

328
329
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,780
Anybody? Yeah.

329
330
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,190
I've done it.

330
331
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:44,820
How about if you send that email off at 6:00 and
then you get on a transcontinental flight to Maui.

331
332
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,860
Yeah. Here's how you save yourself from doing this.

332
333
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,980
You add a ConfigVariable.

333
334
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,240
Let's call it JeffsCrazyFeature
and I'll turn it off by default.

334
335
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,390
I'll send out the email and I'll say if you want
to see my feature, turn on this ConfigVariable

335
336
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:09,570
and at runtime they can turn on features, turn off features,
turn on debug features and you can get on that plane to Maui

336
337
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,850
and feel confident that you haven't broken the build

337
338
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:16,470
and if you did break the build they can just
turn it off and their work is not blocked.

338
339
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:22,940
So, you can get a sample of this
console code at the attendee website.

339
340
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,880
It's locked.

340
341
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,800
It's a sample of the console hooked into the
default OpenGL sample that comes with Xcode.

341
342
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,320
I encourage you to use it.

342
343
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,190
Figure out new ways to use it.

343
344
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,480
Extend it.

344
345
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:42,770
Use it in your games to data drive your experience, to
give your designers every knob possible to let them design

345
346
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:46,760
and every artist to let them just make great art, you know.

346
347
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,990
Let them do what they do best.

347
348
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,430
Thank you for your time.

348
349
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,030
I'd like to bring up Pete to talk about game art.

349
350
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,450
[ Applause ]

350
351
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,690
>> Pete: Hi everybody.

351
352
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,390
My name is Pete.

352
353
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,300
I'm an artist on Quest.

353
354
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:07,520
So today I'm going to talk about art, the art style that
we chose for Quest, how we built the art assets for Quest

354
355
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:14,470
and the steps that we took to optimize the artwork to
make it run really fast, way over 30 frames a second.

355
356
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:18,260
So to get started let's talk about style.

356
357
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:24,140
We really wanted to pick a style in
Quest that showed off really well

357
358
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,960
on all the Apple platforms whether it
was the smaller screen on the iPhone,

358
359
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,550
the larger screen on the iPad we
wanted to see the characters.

359
360
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,930
We wanted to know what they were doing.

360
361
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:38,760
We wanted to relate to the world and we
really wanted that style to be cohesive.

361
362
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:44,380
We wanted it to feel exactly like you're seeing the
exact same game whether you were looking at the UI,

362
363
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:49,100
the characters, the dungeon and because
we only had two months to create this,

363
364
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,140
we picked a style that was achievable
in that amount of time.

364
365
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:57,440
We didn't have a lot of time to do high polynomial mapping.

365
366
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,930
We wanted it to look good but we really needed
to make sure that we were doing the right thing.

366
367
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:08,240
So when you're designing your game,
style is also very important.

367
368
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,500
You want to pick a style that's really
going to speak to your audience.

368
369
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:18,730
If you're designing a history-based game starring Abraham
Lincoln you probably don't want to render him looking

369
370
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:21,180
like an animated character with a bazooka.

370
371
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:25,220
You're going to alienate a large portion
well maybe that's the greatest idea ever

371
372
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:25,950
[ Laughter ]

372
373
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:33,530
But the people who are coming to your game
are going to have an expectation of the style

373
374
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:37,360
and they want to relate to it and love it.

374
375
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,250
So let's start getting into it a
little bit about how we created Quest.

375
376
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,430
The. How many people out there know what a texture atlas is?

376
377
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:51,820
How many people are currently using
texture atlases in their applications?

377
378
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:59,860
So this is a great way to really optimize your
game and get a lot of really good performance.

378
379
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:09,790
You might be surprised to know that this one texture,
this 1024 texture accounts for 80 to 90% of our dungeon.

379
380
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:12,290
We're loading one texture.

380
381
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:18,780
So if out there if you don't know what a texture
atlas is basically instead of taking all of this,

381
382
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,960
these small little textures and
setting them to the GPU to get rendered

382
383
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,370
and having all these draw call saying
render me, render me, render me, render me,

383
384
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:29,870
we're combining all of these little
textures into one larger texture

384
385
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,960
and you're sending one time to get rendered, one draw call.

385
386
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,910
It's a lot more efficient.

386
387
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:39,130
Now as a programmer you're looking at
this and you're saying that's great.

387
388
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:43,020
You know we get a lot of really good
efficiency and it's a great way to work.

388
389
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:49,350
As an artist if there are any artists out
there, you might think this is insane.

389
390
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,560
You might have never worked like this before.

390
391
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:58,590
You're asking yourself why do I want to work this way and
I kind of had that opinion at first but I actually learned

391
392
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:05,610
to love it because one thing it does
is it keeps your artwork unified.

392
393
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:07,530
The style of the dungeon is very unified.

393
394
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,760
When I'm working on the dungeon I bring up this one texture.

394
395
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:17,830
I know where all the pieces are going and I can
start looking at the colors and looking at the values

395
396
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:23,650
of everything and unifying it so it
all looks like one cohesive piece.

396
397
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:28,890
You can see in the upper-left hand corner
that's our tileable texture for our floor.

397
398
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:31,590
To the right of that is our tileable texture for our wall.

398
399
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:37,760
You can see we have pieces for the banner, more organic
pieces on the right-hand side for our sculptural pieces

399
400
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:45,590
like the Gargoyle head or the sculpture
of the knight holding a sword.

400
401
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:52,010
Bottom left-hand corner we have pieces that
we're constantly reusing on doorways, on bridges,

401
402
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:56,590
so when we start to make a new piece
we can take all of these things

402
403
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,590
and know that we have a little bit of the stairs.

403
404
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,810
We have a little bit of wall.

404
405
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:07,130
We can combine them all into one object and load
that game and it's very fast and very efficient.

405
406
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:10,480
I'm a little bit obsessive about building on the grid.

406
407
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,130
It's a very efficient way to do
both 2D artwork and 3D artwork.

407
408
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:22,970
We use the grid for our interface, for a lot of our
models, for how we put our texture libraries together,

408
409
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:29,450
our texture atlases together so you can see this is
all on a power of 2 grid or the majority of it is

409
410
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:34,770
and one of the reasons why we do this is
to optimize our texture as much as we can.

410
411
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:37,310
We don't want a lot of wasted space in our texture.

411
412
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:42,910
Every time you waste space in a texture you're
losing an opportunity to make your game cooler.

412
413
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:47,500
So we've tried to use almost every single
pixel we possibly can in this texture

413
414
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,590
because it's going to be loaded into our game.

414
415
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:59,010
We also build on the grid to get a
consistent texel density in our dungeon.

415
416
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:04,050
So when you see a doorway next to a wall
that has the exact same texel density

416
417
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,450
so the details are going to match up exactly.

417
418
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:10,860
So you can see on the upper left, that is a 2D texture.

418
419
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,630
It's on a 256x256 grid.

419
420
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,300
It's from our texture atlas.

420
421
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:21,630
We're applying that to a polygon that's in our
3D art package that's also on a 256x256 grid

421
422
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:29,770
and that's being rendered in the world at
approximately 256x256 pixels on screen.

422
423
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:32,130
This is very efficient.

423
424
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:38,290
This is a great way to work because you're
not putting a super large texture in an area

424
425
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:41,260
where you're going to waste that resolution.

425
426
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:50,500
So if we were to map our floor with a 2048x2048 texture
and you're only going to see that on screen at 256x256,

426
427
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,440
then that's a lot of memory that's wasted.

427
428
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:58,460
Now given that this is a 3D environment,
a 3D world you're not going

428
429
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:03,310
to always be rendering stuff on
screen at that exact texel density.

429
430
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:08,790
When things go farther away from the camera you're,
they're going to get more, they're going to get tighter

430
431
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,050
when they get closer to the camera they're
going to get a little bit blurrier.

431
432
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:18,890
So this is just a good rule of thumb to use so you're
not putting an exit sign on a doorway that 2048

432
433
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:23,170
and you're basically wasting a lot of your memory.

433
434
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,740
So let's start building a dungeon.

434
435
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:31,280
This was one of the first textures and the first
pieces that we built when we were building the dungeon.

435
436
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,250
It's on a 256x256 grid.

436
437
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:37,480
It's 256x256 and it's one of our floor textures.

437
438
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,720
We took it and we started tiling it.

438
439
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:47,060
Because it's geometry we can flip it, we can
rotate it and we can orient it in such a way

439
440
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:50,710
that we're getting rid of a lot of that tiling pattern.

440
441
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,890
We're going to add some baseboard trim.

441
442
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:59,360
This is going to be used to kind of soften
the transition between the floor and the wall.

442
443
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:07,420
It's also on the grid, a little bit crazy about
the grid and we're going to add some walls.

443
444
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:14,530
We, because these pieces are tileable, we can make as
big of a room as we want, as small a room as we want

444
445
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:19,870
and later on I'll show you even more of the
pieces we use to add a lot of variation.

445
446
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,620
This is just an outline of how the pieces fit together.

446
447
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:28,920
Because again we're also, we have all of our vertices on
the grid because these pieces fit together in such a way

447
448
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,810
like puzzle pieces we don't see any gaps.

448
449
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:34,240
We don't see any holes in our geometry.

449
450
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,890
There's no weird, rendering artifacts.

450
451
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,580
It just all comes together.

451
452
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:43,260
Now the grid is also just a suggestion.

452
453
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:53,700
Because we're building a very you know square very man-made
structure like a dungeon it makes sense to build on a grid.

453
454
00:31:53,700 --> 00:32:01,550
Other things like sculptures, stairs, the broken
pieces on the stairs; they're not on the grid.

454
455
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,650
They don't need to be on the grid.

455
456
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:08,470
We wanted to kind of give more of an organic feel
to some of the areas so those are completely off.

456
457
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:13,780
Although the main structure of the stairs,
the height and width of the stairs is

457
458
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,140
on the grid and that's for animation purposes.

458
459
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:22,600
If we had an animator who wanted to animate a
character walking up the stairs instead of doing a lot

459
460
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:27,780
of kinematics we can basically tell him
the width, tell him or her the width

460
461
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,690
of the stairs and they can animate to that scale.

461
462
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:36,850
If we were to make an entire game, if we had that
constant scale of stairs, we could use it on everything,

462
463
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,920
even though the look will change,
the animation will always sync up.

463
464
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,740
You won't see any clipping.

464
465
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,830
It'll look pretty good.

465
466
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:48,630
So here is just a shot of a few of the
pieces that we used to build the dungeon.

466
467
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:56,020
You can see some grates on the floor, some
doors, doorways, parts of our sculpture.

467
468
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:01,160
Initially when we were building these pieces we
were thinking especially with Jeff and Graeme

468
469
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:09,900
that we would take these and do a random map dungeon where
we'd apply a set of rules through code and hit a button

469
470
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:14,760
and it would give us our own unique dungeon
for that time when we started the game.

470
471
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:20,490
We didn't have enough time to implement that but
it might be an idea that we use in the future.

471
472
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,930
Art efficiency.

472
473
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:28,800
Like Jeff said earlier the initial character that we
did, we did pretty fast and it was way above 3,000 polys.

473
474
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,360
It had way too many bones, actually had
individual fingers that could animate.

474
475
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,490
He had a tongue.

475
476
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:38,690
He had some teeth, eyeballs and it was way too much.

476
477
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,530
It was overkill.

477
478
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:48,190
On our devices it looked beautiful but given the camera
view of our game you're not going to see any of it.

478
479
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:51,930
So we took another pass on him
and we just got rid of it all.

479
480
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,400
We took polygons out of the face.

480
481
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,540
We got rid of his fingers.

481
482
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:04,170
We tried to give the player the maximum amount of
quality in art with the minimum amount of resources.

482
483
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:12,210
Efficiency is always important even if you had an
unlimited amount of RAM and video memory and whatever,

483
484
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,330
you still have to take the time to create this.

484
485
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:22,570
So, working with resolutions that are a little bit
lower, it's actually will save you a lot of time as well.

485
486
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:27,410
Here's a shot of a hand where and it's
kind of hard to see but you can see

486
487
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:30,500
where we just completely cut out all the fingers.

487
488
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,750
Our hero grabs a sword.

488
489
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:35,970
He doesn't do any pointing barely any waving.

489
490
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:40,930
He needed a mitt and that's all the player's
going to notice is that mitt of that character.

490
491
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:45,340
So, got rid of all those polys
and made it a lot more efficient.

491
492
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:49,450
Next gen graphics are awesome.

492
493
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:50,710
I love them.

493
494
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:56,470
They make games look amazing but
they also come with a huge tradeoff.

494
495
00:34:56,470 --> 00:35:02,020
If you want to cut your texture memory in
half, then you might be able to add more maps

495
496
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:08,350
and that might make your game look awesome but you have
to understand these tradeoffs before you start jumping

496
497
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:12,030
in to using things like norm maps or ambient occlusion maps

497
498
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:19,330
or realtime mesh displacement,
dynamic lighting, dynamic shadows.

498
499
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:24,170
Some of the most successful games out there
right now are using very little technology.

499
500
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:28,310
Now, it's not to say that there's not a lot of
really awesome games that use a lot of technology too

500
501
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:35,930
but you really need to pick what's best for your game and
what your audience is going to notice is if it's very subtle

501
502
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:40,240
like a subtle specular map and it's
causing you a lot of frame right issues,

502
503
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:47,160
then maybe that feature is just
not that important for your game.

503
504
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:53,980
So in closing I'd just like to say that a lot
of the stuff that we've talked about is not new.

504
505
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,820
The gaming industry has been using it for many, many years.

505
506
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:03,560
It's tried and true methods and at the same time we're
not saying that this is how you have to make games.

506
507
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:09,070
These are just some ideas that might help you
optimize, might help you make better games.

507
508
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:17,210
If you were making a Gumby surfing game building on
the grid might not make any sense at all but hopefully

508
509
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:20,870
that we've given you a little bit of
information so that you can continue

509
510
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:23,100
to make awesome games and we can continue playing them.

510
511
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,500
So, thanks for your time.

511
512
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,360
[ Applause ]

512
513
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:28,890
>> Graeme: Thanks Pete.

513
514
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:32,180
I think you did awesome, huh?

514
515
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:41,690
So the one dozen things that we learnt whilst we were
making Quest that I think can really apply into your game

515
516
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:47,480
that I think you can take home tonight and hopefully
come and talk to us in the labs tomorrow about.

516
517
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,180
Number one is optimizing assets.

517
518
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:55,580
As Pete just showed, optimizing your assets not only
increases your frame rate, it decreases your load time

518
519
00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:01,550
and it makes a tremendous difference to the final
frame rate and your right production schedule.

519
520
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:07,230
If you're making polygon, you know, 3,200 polygon
seismic shocks, it's going to take a little while longer

520
521
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:11,330
to keep going with all the characters if
that's the resolution that you choose.

521
522
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,890
Choose a careful resolution.

522
523
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,460
Stick to it.

523
524
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:20,840
Optimization also extends out to things like texture
atlases and being able to use a single texture for most

524
525
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:28,810
of your level and as Pete pointed out texture
atlas that is full, is a happy texture atlas.

525
526
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:31,900
Optimization also applies to shaders.

526
527
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,440
Our first shader was awesome.

527
528
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,080
We could have stuck with it.

528
529
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:42,190
We really could have cut down number of polygons and
finally got that thing up to 30 Hertz and we'd have ended

529
530
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:45,740
up with BoxQuest but we didn't stop there.

530
531
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,860
We optimized.

531
532
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:53,740
We came up with a way to produce lightmaps that
were actually could work with a simple multiply.

532
533
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:58,050
The challenge is never in really getting the right results.

533
534
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,660
The right result is always there.

534
535
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:05,810
The challenge to game developers is always to think
about how can I get to kind of the right result quickly.

535
536
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:13,000
So by ramping up our diffuse map and making it much, much
brighter in the very beginning we were able to do a lot

536
537
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:21,190
of the pre-computing ahead of time and that made a
difference in our shader, bringing it down from the 8 lines

537
538
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:26,910
of code to 3 lines of code that it finally
was and increased our frame rate dramatically.

538
539
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:36,960
Also, giving the control back to the artist who can then
go and go crazy at the higher value diffused texture.

539
540
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,670
Something else is it's a game.

540
541
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:45,580
Now if you have been to Hollywood or seen a Hollywood
set you know that Hollywood sets are just these facades.

541
542
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:50,120
They're just there to be put in front
of the camera and what a lot of us do

542
543
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:55,470
when we make our world is we make these fantastic
3D worlds that you could really walk around

543
544
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,250
and look in any direction and there's stuff there.

544
545
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,460
There's trees behind me.

545
546
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:05,850
There's all sorts of things going on and you have
to remember that just a facade means just a facade.

546
547
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:11,730
Build only what the camera sees and in
Quest we built only what the camera sees.

547
548
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:15,170
If there's a door, there are no
polygons on the other side of the door.

548
549
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:19,880
If there's a wall that you can't see
the ground, that wall is not even there.

549
550
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:24,530
It doesn't matter that it's not even there
because your game players will never even see it.

550
551
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:30,080
It does matter and make a tremendous difference
to your bottom line and your frame rate.

551
552
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:35,460
So optimizing, always think about
your level as a Hollywood set.

552
553
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,770
It's completely and utterly fake.

553
554
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:42,450
Memory is something that's on your device.

554
555
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:46,290
I want to have the most wonderful
looking game in front of me.

555
556
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:48,740
I want my menu to be great.

556
557
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,040
I want a large Quest logo on the screen.

557
558
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,910
I want to use an interface that looks beautiful.

558
559
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:59,560
I also want to stream my level in so that
my level has the most polygons I can get

559
560
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,100
onto it in a particular part of the level.

560
561
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,960
It doesn't matter that it's going
to be gone in the next thing.

561
562
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,510
I'm going to get rid of it and eject to out of memory.

562
563
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:11,730
As soon as this first user interface
is gone I'm getting rid of it.

563
564
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:12,930
I'm freeing it.

564
565
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:15,470
I want that memory back so I can have particle systems.

565
566
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:18,440
I want that memory back so I can have two more bad guys.

566
567
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,580
Purge assets which are not in use,
reload them when you need them again.

567
568
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:28,370
It lets you be a much more, much better memory
citizen and get a lot more into your game.

568
569
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:32,640
If you were trying to load your entire
game at once, then use UIs and all,

569
570
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,110
you know that wonderful settings
screen the user only ever sees once

570
571
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:40,610
and you're not doing your game or your players any service.

571
572
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:43,090
This also applies to texture size.

572
573
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:49,350
As Pete said the number of times that we see textures
which are 1024x1024 hidden in the end of the level

573
574
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:54,640
that just shows a little exit sign, I've actually seen
that and it's taking up all this memory and it's taking

574
575
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:00,150
up all this bandwidth as it's rendered because the
renderer is going through it because he didn't,

575
576
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:06,390
bitmaps and bitmaps are made to even using more
memory because it's 1024x1024 is ridiculous.

576
577
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:11,390
Look at how your game is being
rendered and look at that texel density.

577
578
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:14,090
Texel density is tremendously important.

578
579
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:22,750
You want your texture map to be represented in
your 3D world as your artist has authored it.

579
580
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:30,730
One way that you can really optimize both memory
and loading time is to use compressed textures.

580
581
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:38,070
Compressed textures are 1/16th the size of the uncompressed
texture and as you can see here on our wall texture,

581
582
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:44,640
the uncompressed versus the 4-bits per pixel versus
the 2-bits per pixel there's almost no difference

582
583
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,910
and something else that's key here with our texture is
we are going to take this and we are going to multiply it

583
584
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:55,250
by some random lightmap value that's between 0 and 1.

584
585
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:01,260
We're going to abolish it so just in the name
of making something that looks good in the game

585
586
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:06,700
so this will not even be seen in the
game world even once we're finally there.

586
587
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:11,200
Texture compression is a great way to
load assets faster and to be able to get

587
588
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,950
into your game quicker and saving a whole bunch of memory.

588
589
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:24,820
We talked about gameloops and how important
it is to do the gameloop in the right order.

589
590
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:27,470
Load up that GPU.

590
591
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,320
Then handle user input.

591
592
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:37,000
Then let the aliens update and invade the world because you
prepositioned your little base to fire back just in time.

592
593
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,860
Multiple devices.

593
594
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:46,270
You might think that screen size and resolution mean exactly
the same thing but in fact it means two different things.

594
595
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:49,160
Screen size on our devices is different.

595
596
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:56,710
I'm going to hold the iPad in my hand very differently
than I'm going to hold the phone or the iPod Touch.

596
597
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:59,330
I might hold one in one hand and one in two hands.

597
598
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:04,540
You have to be thinking about how what
that means into your game design for you

598
599
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:08,550
to actually implement the same game on different devices.

599
600
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:10,540
It's going to mean different interfaces.

600
601
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,490
It's going to mean that different user interfaces.

601
602
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,220
It's going to mean different controls.

602
603
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:18,980
The resolution difference is also
something you're going to have to deal with.

603
604
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:29,030
A low-resolution game running on the iPod Touch needs to
be up rest and look fantastic on the iPhone 4 and I have

604
605
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:34,660
to tell you the full resolution game on the
iPhone 4 is like nothing you've ever seen.

605
606
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:40,560
When you hold that in your hands,
oh my God, that thing's a kicker.

606
607
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,960
Absolutely the most beautiful thing
I have ever worked on in my life.

607
608
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:52,110
Then the iPad, an amazing device but I hold it
differently and I play games on that for longer than I play

608
609
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:55,030
because I'm sitting on my couch
and my wife's watching House.

609
610
00:43:55,030 --> 00:44:00,340
I don't like House because there's blood and
I'm going to play a game for a whole hour.

610
611
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,650
I'm not the only one that does that.

611
612
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:04,630
I know that.

612
613
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:07,520
So games play very different on devices too.

613
614
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,950
Think about the capabilities.

614
615
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:15,240
Now I already gave you my little rant on
playtesting so I'm not going to reiterate my rant on.

615
616
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,190
I am. I'm going to reiterate my rant.

616
617
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:21,630
Watch other people play your game.

617
618
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:23,330
Exceptionally important.

618
619
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:26,340
Take their input and apply it to your game.

619
620
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:32,220
Always remember that you are not there
when someone else buys your application.

620
621
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,740
They're going to buy your application.

621
622
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:39,770
They're going to hit the button and they're going to wonder
what to do so you might as well get that feedback ahead

622
623
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:42,730
of time and watch someone play your game.

623
624
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:45,160
Do that constantly.

624
625
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:51,380
One of the things that game developers strive for
is reality and oh my God we're so big on that.

625
626
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:58,150
We must have real physics in our games with 3D rigid bodies
and inverse kinematics and all these fantastic things

626
627
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:02,200
that we can put into games now with, you know
because it goes into the back of the box right?

627
628
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,200
It goes in the iTunes store description.

628
629
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,020
Real 3D physics.

629
630
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:06,770
Real lighting.

630
631
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:14,120
I want the perfect full photon pacer that does accurate
lighting on my environment and makes a tremendous difference

631
632
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:19,520
to what how my character looks and does the whole diffuse
shadow behind me that spreads out with the right thing

632
633
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,070
on stage with you know all kinds of cool shadows.

633
634
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:25,310
Games are not reality.

634
635
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:26,540
That's all fabulous.

635
636
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:30,730
I'm here to tell you that's all fabulous
but if your game runs at 4 frames a second

636
637
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:36,460
because you have 3D physics running with absolutely
fantastic lighting with super realistic shadows, guess what.

637
638
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,750
Your game's not fun.

638
639
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:43,720
Games are like Hollywood and like Hollywood
movies they need bright lights shone

639
640
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,500
onto them to look dramatic and look cool.

640
641
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:52,430
You need to be thinking about physics
that operate within your game environment.

641
642
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:56,780
If we were to apply that to Quest, one of
the things you may have noticed in Quest,

642
643
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:00,370
I'm walking on a flat plane ground the whole time.

643
644
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:04,570
So therefore a 2-dimentional physics
system would actually probably do me fine.

644
645
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:06,720
I really don't need a 3D physics system.

645
646
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:15,870
2D physics would actually do fine and even what I would
try because I like frame rate, is I'd try to get my artist

646
647
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:20,330
to animate something to fake physics
completely so there is no physics in my game

647
648
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:23,170
but it sure as heck looks like I have it.

648
649
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:29,560
Lighting I think as we showed, until you saw how the
shader worked I think a lot of you thought oh boy,

649
650
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,340
they have real perfect pixel in their games.

650
651
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:33,190
That's absolutely fantastic.

651
652
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:40,730
You couldn't tell the difference at our angle and
our gameplay what our lighting algorithm actually was

652
653
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:43,410
but it looked real and that's all that matters.

653
654
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:44,930
It's an illusion.

654
655
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:47,300
Real lighting in some games makes a tremendous difference

655
656
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:52,310
if I was a first-person you know version
of Quest I would be thinking wow.

656
657
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:56,580
Maybe I'll get real lighting algorithm here with
real shadows to make a real dramatic difference.

657
658
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,450
You know what?

658
659
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:59,470
My polygon count is very different there.

659
660
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:04,300
My. The way our memory in the world and the aim
I'm going for emotionally, exceptionally different.

660
661
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:08,330
So always remember games are not reality.

661
662
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:12,160
What you're faking needs to be fake.

662
663
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,930
Rendering the world.

663
664
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:22,270
We see an awful lot of people take 10,000 draw calls per
frame and wonder why they're app goes at 4 frames a second.

664
665
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:27,700
They have you know have tens of thousands
of draw calls they do to cause into GL

665
666
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:31,380
and think that their app should run at 60.

666
667
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:35,440
Well I'm here to tell you you're orders of magnitude off.

667
668
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,640
You should be thinking in terms of 10 draw calls per frame.

668
669
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,640
How many of you have 10 draw calls per frame in your game?

669
670
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,390
How many of you have more than 100?

670
671
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:49,850
The more than 100 crowd got some work to do.

671
672
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:57,330
Ten draw calls a frame is how you're going to bring
your game frame rate up to where it needs to be.

672
673
00:47:57,330 --> 00:48:01,820
You need to be looking at the tricks we
have told you today with texture atlases.

673
674
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:10,550
You need to be looking at how you can load your level and
use GL draw arrays as a huge boost to actually get all

674
675
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:14,990
of your as many polygons on screen as possible
using all the features that everyone's going

675
676
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:19,350
to be telling you about this week in the GL lessons.

676
677
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:23,830
We did a lot right in Quest I think
given that we had two months.

677
678
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:27,480
One of the things that really proved
out was our data driven pipeline.

678
679
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,710
We had to change our variables on the fly.

679
680
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:36,280
Getting that power to the artist, giving that power to
the game designer to be able to load things on the fly,

680
681
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:43,220
drop assets in, data driving our game pipeline made a
tremendous difference towards us getting this game finished

681
682
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,080
on time.

682
683
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:52,090
Collada was a fantastic format to export our
3D assets in and load them on the devices.

683
684
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:55,430
Collada is easy to parse, easy to manipulate

684
685
00:48:55,430 --> 00:49:00,960
and it made writing scene graph based 3D
system that we used for Quest really easy.

685
686
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,620
We cheated in the right places.

686
687
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,090
We cheated with the lights.

687
688
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:06,030
We cheated with the lightmaps.

688
689
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:09,930
We cheated in the right places to achieve the right effect.

689
690
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:11,840
Finally we used Apple technologies.

690
691
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:19,020
We trusted the UIKit and AVFoundation,
OpenGL 2.0, game kits;

691
692
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:23,020
that all those fantastic frameworks
would work as advertised and guess what?

692
693
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:28,690
They do. Of course it was not all roses.

693
694
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:31,750
There were many late nights on this project.

694
695
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:38,730
One of the things that we initially did was we promised
Pete, our artist, we're going to give you fantastic tools.

695
696
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:41,800
Well, the number of tools we came up with was exactly zero

696
697
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:47,240
and we probably should have spent
a little bit more time on tools.

697
698
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:52,980
We had wrote a fantastic particle system, a parametric
particle system that you just had to pass time in

698
699
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:58,480
and it would render out these fire things, splines and
everything and I thought my programmer art looked good

699
700
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:05,030
but Pete tells me it was really bad but and we wrote
this world space particle system where foibles could pass

700
701
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:10,480
in the sky and just reflect in the ground but we didn't
provide Pete with a tool in order to edit particles.

701
702
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:16,820
We should have spent more time upfront writing
tools and thinking about our asset pipeline.

702
703
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:19,820
Our asset pipeline is still not perfect.

703
704
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:25,000
If we had written those tools maybe we would have started
to write something that loaded the particles directly

704
705
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,920
into the game and dropped them via
the HTTP line that we did build.

705
706
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:34,690
We started to build the HTTP connection but
we didn't actually go ahead and complete that.

706
707
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:42,840
We probably scoped a little bit on the impossible side but
this is one of the things I actually liked about doing.

707
708
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,070
The challenge was exciting.

708
709
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:52,430
Make something that looks super fantastic,
sexy in two months and we did it.

709
710
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:56,440
So I'm going to say that we did that right
but it was frightening let me tell you.

710
711
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:01,520
When you drive home at night and saying well
we're going to make Quest in two months.

711
712
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,520
Finally, a lot of people ask us are we
going to make this into a real game?

712
713
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:10,170
And the answer to that is no.

713
714
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,300
We're not.

714
715
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:19,010
Quest was only made to be shown here this morning to all of
you and to be used for the sessions here throughout the week

715
716
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:22,530
and we'll be repeating on Friday so I guess that counts.

716
717
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:24,400
We're already onto the next thing.

717
718
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:29,970
We're onto our next two months and I've
got to tell you that's even better.

718
719
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:31,560
We read a few books and magazines.

719
720
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,070
We want to share a few of those with you.

720
721
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:35,660
Game Developer Magazine.

721
722
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,920
How many of you read that?

722
723
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:44,860
It has these fantastic post-mortems in every single
month of games coming out on all the platforms

723
724
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:49,510
and we modeled our talk today a little
bit on those post-mortem series.

724
725
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:56,980
I love that it tells the story of what went right, what went
wrong, the approach they took to managing their project,

725
726
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:00,110
the approach they took to getting
the thing out in the store,

726
727
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:03,540
game design elements that work,
game design elements that didn't.

727
728
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:09,430
That is a fantastic series and worth getting
that magazine monthly just for that alone.

728
729
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:16,150
If you're a programmer you should have the
Graphics Gems series right there on your shelf.

729
730
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:21,800
If you want fast rays intersection
you know that's in Graphics Gems 1.

730
731
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:27,200
If you want you know fast access align boundary box
to boundary box, Graphics Gems 2.

731
732
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,750
You kind of learn where those tricks are.

732
733
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:35,260
Those fast algorithms, you want to get
those books, have them on your shelves.

733
734
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:40,090
Same thing applies to the Games Programming Gems
which kind of has much larger systems in it.

734
735
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:42,170
If you want to think about terrain systems.

735
736
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:46,530
If you want to think about you
know BSP rendering environments.

736
737
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:52,300
A lot of that is in there and a lot of those stories in
there are also very good about the games they play too.

737
738
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:57,170
We recommend a whole bunch of sessions for you to go to so,

738
739
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:00,520
especially the Game Center sessions,
learning about that framework.

739
740
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:08,420
It is going to become extremely applicable later this year
when millions of people have access to sign up accounts

740
741
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:12,760
and make Game Center their homes for their games.

741
742
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:17,150
A lot of the OpenGL sessions this
week are absolutely fantastic,

742
743
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:21,000
absolutely incredible stuff is happening out of--

743
744
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,230
If you go to those you'll see something incredible.

744
745
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:31,530
Core Animation was used for everything in our game to drive
IUI, to drive our characters, to drive anything animated.

745
746
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:34,430
It's a fantastic framework.

746
747
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:41,690
The AVFoundation, being able to use that for
augmented reality applications as well as sound.

747
748
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:48,680
I mean just the access you get from
AVFoundation in iPhone OS4 absolutely incredible.

748
749
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:56,720
But the most important thing I can tell you is to have fun.

749
750
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:03,390
If you are a game developer and you are not
having fun, you are in the wrong industry.

750
751
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:05,210
Let me tell you.

751
752
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:13,040
If you're not coming to work and thinking this is the
best thing ever, what the heck are you doing making a game

752
753
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:18,560
because your game isn't going to end up as
fun and you're not going to make any money.

753
754
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:23,380
Make something that you think is fun
and that you are passionate about.

754
755
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:27,460
You have to be thinking every single day oh
my God I'm working on the coolest thing ever!

755
756
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:31,990
Look! I want you to show me that
stuff in the last of our and I want

756
757
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:36,830
to see how excited you all are
about making games on our devices.

757
758
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:42,010
You need to be the only way you're going to get the
extra little bit of magic into your games is by having

758
759
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:46,020
that passion and by really applying
that passion into the games.

759
760
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:51,220
That extra little 5% you had because you had fun
making the game and you had fun playtesting it

760
761
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:54,580
and you had fun showing it off makes a difference.

761
762
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:59,530
It's the difference between an application that
falls flat and an application that sparkles.

762
763
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:06,270
So if you're in the game industry make sure you
have fun making games and absolutely finally,

763
764
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:14,470
if you have any questions please send an email to our
Graphics and Game Technologies Evangelist Allan Schaffer.

764
765
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:15,150
Thank you.

765
766
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:16,990
It's been great talking to you today.

766
767
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:28,360
