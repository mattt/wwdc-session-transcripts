00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,740
>> Stuart Cheshire: Good morning ladies and gentlemen.

1
2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,490
It's good to see you all here today.

2
3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,350
My name is Stuart Cheshire and I'm the architect of Bonjour.

3
4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:21,820
I'm going to be telling you today about Bonjour
and related technologies and particularly

4
5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,700
about how it interacts with multitasking on iOS 4.

5
6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:30,330
Let me ask how many people are here at their first WWDC.

6
7
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,410
Can I see a show of hands?

7
8
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,510
That is amazing.

8
9
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,410
That's more than half the room.

9
10
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,400
And how many are here for the first
time at a Bonjour presentation.

10
11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:49,270
OK. Then I'm glad we have some overview because this is the
first time for I'd say about 80% of the people in the room.

11
12
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:54,830
In previous years, what I'm going to talk about is the
overview would have been the entire hour-long presentation.

12
13
00:00:54,830 --> 00:01:00,800
We have a lot more stuff to talk about today so it's going
to be very condensed but I hope it'll give you the flavor

13
14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,430
of what it's about and at least point you in the right
direction for more documentation to find out more details.

14
15
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:16,840
Rory McGuire, my colleague will be telling you about some
specific details of Bonjour on iPhone OS and will be talking

15
16
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,350
about some other developments because
Bonjour is not just a Mac technology.

16
17
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,570
It's not just an Apple technology.

17
18
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:28,430
We have Bonjour on Windows and there are many
third party products using Bonjour as well.

18
19
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,760
It is an open standard.

19
20
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:35,890
The source code is open source under the Apache
2 license and all the specifications of public.

20
21
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:41,810
We'll wrap up with some tips and reminders
of common mistakes that which developers make

21
22
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,670
so that you can avoid making the same mistakes.

22
23
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,490
So let's start with the high level goal.

23
24
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:58,310
TCP/IP, the technology of the internet clearly won out
against all the other wide area of technologies like DECnet

24
25
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:06,920
and XNS, X.25, ISDN and it was a great
achievement to build a global scale network.

25
26
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,450
But where it lacked was ease of
use and the canonical example I

26
27
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:16,360
like to give is you take a USB printer,
you take the cable, you plug it in.

27
28
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:22,230
Nobody has to type addresses and subnet masks and
configuration parameters to make that USB work.

28
29
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,880
And there's no technical reason why
IP can't be just as easy as that.

29
30
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,350
The only reason is that all the people working on it
in the early days were so focused on the challenge

30
31
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:39,520
of building a global network to rival the telephone system
that they totally neglected worrying about the details

31
32
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,310
of two computers connected with a cable
because that seems so trivial in comparison.

32
33
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:51,420
What we did with Bonjour and zero configuration
networking is to go back and fill in that missing piece.

33
34
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,420
So when you're designing your application
or your hardware product,

34
35
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,750
if you have any doubts about a certain
design decision, kind of mentally think,

35
36
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,910
if I plug it into USB, what would I expect.

36
37
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:08,420
We would like the same user experience with an Ethernet
cable or with Wi-Fi or with IP or with Bluetooth.

37
38
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,440
So that's the goal.

38
39
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,530
We want networking where you just plug it and it works.

39
40
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,800
This is how we achieve that goal.

40
41
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:25,300
And there are three legs of technology that make up the
foundation for Bonjour, zero configuration networking

41
42
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:33,900
and that foundation is what lets you developers write
applications where you can rely on networking being present

42
43
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,710
and functional and not have to worry about
a lot of failure modes that you used to have

43
44
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,490
and I'll start up with one of those failure modes.

44
45
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,080
DHCP is great.

45
46
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:51,550
We are not competing with DHCP at all and if you have a DHCP
server on the network handing out addresses, that's great.

46
47
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:58,310
But if you don't, if you just have two devices connected
with an Ethernet cable or some devices connected

47
48
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,230
to a simple Ethernet switch, then there's no DHCP server.

48
49
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,390
And in the past, most devices would just give up.

49
50
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:11,050
So you can't find DHCP server and refuse
to work until the user fix the problem.

50
51
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:16,920
Now for desktop computer with a screen and a
keyboard, that's annoying but it's not fatal

51
52
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,110
because the user can configure a manual address.

52
53
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:25,500
But for devices that don't have a screen and a keyboard,
for device like an AirPort Extreme Base Station

53
54
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,390
where it's only user interface for
controlling it is over the network.

54
55
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,400
It has got to get itself on the network.

55
56
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,350
Because if its network is misconfigured
so it can't communicate,

56
57
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,430
you have no way of communicating with it to fix that.

57
58
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,200
So IPv6 has link-local addressing.

58
59
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:47,900
Every IPv6 device configures itself a link-local address
on every interface which is not configured by the user.

59
60
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:55,040
The user can't break that so you can rely
on it to have an address and with RC3927,

60
61
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,010
we have the same thing in IPv4
and you've probably seen this now.

61
62
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,940
This is not new.

62
63
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,760
Ten years ago when we're talking about this, this was new.

63
64
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,820
These days everyone in the room is probably
familiar with those addresses 169.254

64
65
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:13,830
and that means the machine picked its own address because
it couldn't find the DHCP server to give it another address.

65
66
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,320
So this is a good start.

66
67
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,640
We can have two or three or five machines
all with self-assigned unique addresses

67
68
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,000
but it doesn't really help you if
you don't know what the address is

68
69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,090
and nobody likes typing addresses especially IPv6 addresses.

69
70
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,800
With conventional IP, people are
used to using DNS host names.

70
71
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,270
So following a similar principle that we want to
stay as close as possible to our current practices,

71
72
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:45,070
we use Multicast DNS which uses the same naming syntax,
the same record types, the same resource record types

72
73
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:49,530
and the same packet format of standard
DNS but without a central server.

73
74
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,210
And every device on the network has a piece of software

74
75
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:57,690
which is the Multicast DNS responder
which knows that device its own name.

75
76
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,160
And when the client multicast a
query to every device on the network,

76
77
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,530
the one that recognizes its name says,
hey, that's me and it answers the query.

77
78
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,770
Now that's good.

78
79
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:14,080
That's got us to parity with what people expected of the
internet 10 years ago but you still have to know the name

79
80
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,170
to type and if you type it wrong, it
doesn't work and you don't really know why.

80
81
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:22,180
So we wanted to go one step beyond that
and that's the third item on this list

81
82
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,230
of technologies and that's service discovery.

82
83
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:31,200
Building on the Multicast DNS mechanisms, we
can also multicast queries to the network.

83
84
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,010
Not for specific host name but for type of service.

84
85
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,030
Say, I want to print.

85
86
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,370
What devices out there can meet that need for me?

86
87
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:45,010
What printers are out there that I can turn a printer up
too that results in sheets of printed paper coming out.

87
88
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:50,850
And that service discovery is the
third leg and that's the level that you

88
89
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,620
as developers will generally be interacting with this.

89
90
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:59,770
Because the addressing is handled by the OS, so unless
you're building hardware devices, you don't need to do that

90
91
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,670
and the host name lookup is an OS level function.

91
92
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:11,060
But if you are offering services on the network and
that means if you have a socket that's listening

92
93
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:16,910
or if you're making connections on the network, you'll
want to interact with the service discovery APIs

93
94
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:24,340
that Bonjour provides on the Mac, on
iOS, on Windows and on other platforms.

94
95
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,150
So here's an overview.

95
96
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,270
You have a piece of software that's
listening for connections.

96
97
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:37,180
That's great and you can make the user write down
the port number on a post-it note but it's better

97
98
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,190
to use the technology we have to
advertise that fact on the network.

98
99
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:46,330
When your service starts up or when the machine
wakes from sleep or when you connect the network,

99
100
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:51,360
it sends out a couple of announcement packets to let clients

100
101
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,870
that may be listening know that
this service is now on the network.

101
102
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:59,230
Now it's not continuously broadcasting its pockets
because that would add up to a lot of wasted bandwidth

102
103
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,960
but it does send out a few packets on startup.

103
104
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,620
Now suppose a client comes along
and were looking for that service.

104
105
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:15,140
The client will do a browse operation and these
APIs were available in C and in Cocoa and in Java,

105
106
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:20,950
in different languages, but they all have the
common property that you browse the services

106
107
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:24,860
and the server responds if it has
an instance of that service type.

107
108
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,430
So this lets the client build a list to
present to the user so the user can pick

108
109
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,380
which particular instance they want to connect to.

109
110
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:39,980
And then the second step is resolving that name
service to get the current IP address and port number

110
111
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:45,240
where that service can be reached and this
is a very important point with Bonjour.

111
112
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,530
Browsing and resolving are separate, other service
discovery protocols didn't make this separation

112
113
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:57,580
and the reason it's important is because, I'll
go back to the familiar example of printing.

113
114
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,380
Browsing the network defined which printers
are available and picking the one you're going

114
115
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,000
to use most of time is your default prints out.

115
116
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,980
It's an operation that people do relatively infrequently.

116
117
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,720
Some people may only do it once a year.

117
118
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,290
They pick a printer and then they don't change it at work.

118
119
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:20,220
But with DHCP, with link-local addressing, addresses and
ports can change overtime and if your printer preferences

119
120
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,210
on your machine have stored the address and
port number, that might not work tomorrow.

120
121
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,990
But the names are stable overtime.

121
122
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:32,530
So by storing the name and then resolving on
use, you get the current address information.

122
123
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,810
So this is very important, we'll come back to this later.

123
124
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:42,420
Browse to show the use of the list but then resolve a
connection time to find the most up-to-date information.

124
125
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,630
That was on the local network.

125
126
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,270
One of the questions we knew that would come up is,

126
127
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:54,380
well this is great on the local link
but what about across the internet.

127
128
00:09:54,380 --> 00:10:01,850
What if I'm behind the NAT Gateway and the
answer is the same Bonjour APIs that work

128
129
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:08,000
with link-local Multicast DNS also work with
wide area Bonjour and the area where most

129
130
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,160
of you are probably most familiar with this, is this is the
underlying technology between Back to My Mac in MobileMe.

130
131
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,910
So when you're using screen sharing and file sharing to
access your machine across the other side of the country,

131
132
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:26,780
it's wide area Bonjour and the standard Bonjour APIs that
are doing that for you and if you have an application

132
133
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,500
that registers with Bonjour and browses with Bonjour,

133
134
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,820
then your application will work
planet-wide using Back to My Mac as well.

134
135
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,430
It's not just screen sharing and file sharing.

135
136
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:40,950
It supports all of your apps as well.

136
137
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,750
This is the API architecture.

137
138
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:51,080
On top of the kernel, we have a daemon called
mDNSResponder running and clients talk to that daemon

138
139
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,320
to advertise services and browse the services.

139
140
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:01,340
There are three main levels of API here not counting
Java and Python and Ruby and some of the other languages.

140
141
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:06,140
There's the dns_sd.h which is the
low-level C programming API.

141
142
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:12,050
That's available on Mac, Linux, Windows and on the iPhone.

142
143
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:18,210
The next level up is core foundation
CFNetServices and the highest layer is NSNetServices

143
144
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,020
which is the foundation layers used by Cocoa.

144
145
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:26,980
And for most of you in this room doing iOS development,
you'll probably be working at the NSNetServices layer

145
146
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,930
but they are all available on the iPhone.

146
147
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,190
So if you got existing code, you can still use that.

147
148
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:42,520
So Bonjour started off as replacing the AppleTalk
Chooser to define what's on the local network.

148
149
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,100
But when you use the Bonjour APIs
you get a lot more than that.

149
150
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,300
I've talked about discovering local things.

150
151
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,520
I've talked about discovering remote
things by Back to My Mac.

151
152
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,110
I'm going to tell you about discovering
devices that may be asleep.

152
153
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,930
This is the new feature we introduced with
Snow Leopard, we talked about last year.

153
154
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,630
I'll give a little recap of that now.

154
155
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:09,750
And we keep inventing new communication technologies
and they come along with their own sets of APIs

155
156
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:16,880
and their own addressing syntax and their own model for how
they work and that can be a burden for developers to have

156
157
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,230
to keep supporting whatever the new thing is.

157
158
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,790
So one of the great things I was
very excited about last year

158
159
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:29,010
with iPhone OS 3 is peer-to-peer Bonjour over Bluetooth.

159
160
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,610
So you don't have to pair Bluetooth.

160
161
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,880
You don't have to configure it.

161
162
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,420
You don't have to set up the Bluetooth
panel, configure the IP addresses.

162
163
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:41,590
You just use the Bonjour APIs and when you're resolved,
we will actually bring up an IP network over Bluetooth

163
164
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,980
on demand and then connect you to the other device.

164
165
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,330
And this is what's used by the Game Kit on iPhone.

165
166
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:52,780
But it's actually implemented as a Bonjour function
so all of your Bonjour apps get this for free as well.

166
167
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:56,940
So let's talk about the sleeping case.

167
168
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:03,300
Suppose I've got a USB printer plugged
into my Mac with printer sharing

168
169
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,690
and this is great because I can print remotely.

169
170
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:09,070
I can be sitting on the sofa with my laptop and I can print.

170
171
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,360
But not if the computer is asleep.

171
172
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,060
Back to My Mac, similar story.

172
173
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,790
I can get to my computer remotely but not if it's asleep.

173
174
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:27,010
Apple TV can access music and movies and photos of my
iTunes music collection on my iMac but not if it's asleep.

174
175
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:33,430
So on the one hand, customers want to put their machines to
sleep so they're not wasting energy but on the other hand,

175
176
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:39,240
we keep providing useful services to them that mean
they want to keep the machine awake and we wanted

176
177
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:46,770
to resolve this tension and make it so that you can have
the best of both worlds and that's the Bonjour Sleep Proxy.

177
178
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:52,220
The Bonjour Sleep Proxy runs on AirPort Base Stations.

178
179
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:59,300
It runs on Apple TV because that's the device that's always
on, on your network and doesn't take very much power.

179
180
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,460
If you're running internet sharing on your
Mac, then that will also act as a sleep proxy.

180
181
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:09,660
Basically, any device that doesn't take much power
that's always on is a great candidate for a sleep proxy.

181
182
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,440
It's open source so anybody can make
these but for most of you in the room,

182
183
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,880
I'm guessing your AirPort Base
Station is going to be your proxy.

183
184
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:23,650
When the Mac goes to sleep, it takes its Bonjour
service records and ships them in a packet to the proxy.

184
185
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:29,490
Because those service records are a compact
representation of its role on the network, what its name is,

185
186
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:34,730
what its address is, what services it offers, what
ports it's listening on, it takes all that information

186
187
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:41,650
and ships it to the proxy and says this is me, I'm
going to sleep now, wake me up if anybody wants me.

187
188
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:50,840
The iMac goes to sleep and the proxy sends out some proxy
out packets to say, I am now temporarily responsible

188
189
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,260
for this IP address because I'm
proxying for the device that's asleep.

189
190
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,080
Now on my other machine, I have
a document that I want to print.

190
191
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:05,150
So it looks up the address and port, find the Bonjour result

191
192
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:11,790
and it opens a TCP connection and
that TCP SYN goes to the proxy.

192
193
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:17,600
Because the proxy is currently the owner of that IP address.

193
194
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:25,470
The proxy inspects that packet and decides that this is
something that warrants waking up the sleeping machine.

194
195
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:31,070
So it sends a wake-up-packet and the machine wakes up.

195
196
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:37,220
It reclaims its IP address, TCP in the normal course
of operation will retransmit the packet which now goes

196
197
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:43,220
to the newly awakened machine and
the document successfully prints.

197
198
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,840
Many of you may have had this happen
without even realizing it

198
199
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:52,500
because like all good networking technologies,
it's frequently completely invisible.

199
200
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,840
You notice it when it fails.

200
201
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,330
If you hit command-P and the document doesn't print
and you kind of curse, oh my, My Mac has gone to sleep,

201
202
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,970
let me get up and wake it up, then you notice it.

202
203
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:07,030
But if you hit Print and the page comes out, you may
never have even realized that your machine was asleep.

203
204
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:10,170
It woke up to print the document
and then it went back to sleep.

204
205
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,980
And this is really rewarding when
networking technology works that well.

205
206
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,130
It can also be a little bit disappointing
that we're doing all this work

206
207
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,300
to make this magic work and nobody even notices.

207
208
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:20,810
[ Laughter ]

208
209
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:27,190
So it's printed the document, my machine goes back to sleep.

209
210
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:33,890
That was in the case where the client already knows about
the printer because I've set it up as my default printer

210
211
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:40,030
but because of Bonjour service advertising, a friend
could come and visit my house with a laptop computer

211
212
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,290
and they've never been on my network before.

212
213
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:48,760
They've never used my printer before but when they do
Bonjour browsing operation, the proxy responds on behalf

213
214
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,800
of the sleeping machine saying there's a
printing service on this network and it does

214
215
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,020
that without even having to wake the machine.

215
216
00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:01,790
So unlike other Wake-on-LAN technologies
that have been around for a few years,

216
217
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,380
you don't need manual setup in advance to configure this.

217
218
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:10,510
You can walk into a network you've never been on before and
still discover services even on machines that are asleep.

218
219
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:15,040
[ Pause ]

219
220
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:20,380
Bonjour sleep proxy works with any
application that uses the Bonjour APIs.

220
221
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,290
So we use it for printer sharing.

221
222
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:27,060
We use it for Apple TV accessing iTunes.

222
223
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:31,200
Even outside the house, if you want to get
back to your Mac at home and the Mac's asleep,

223
224
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,820
the base station will wake it up
when an incoming connection comes in.

224
225
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:40,460
With command-line ssh, this is not something that
normal users use but the developers tend to love this.

225
226
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:47,300
You can be logged in to a machine with ssh and when you're
finished doing what you're doing, type pmset sleepnow

226
227
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,350
and the machine will go to sleep
without losing your TCP connection.

227
228
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:55,240
Sometime later, you type in that window,
first keystroke, the machine wakes back up,

228
229
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,080
does what you want, put it back to sleep again.

229
230
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:02,680
You can keep your connection open for days or weeks at
a time to a machine that will sleep and wake on demand

230
231
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:08,030
and it doesn't have to awake consuming power 24 hours a
day bust because you've got an ssh log into that machine.

231
232
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:15,900
And for all of your applications that advertise
services with Bonjour, if you advertise your service,

232
233
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,080
we can transfer that data to the sleep proxy.

233
234
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:24,040
If you don't advertise the service, we don't know
about you and we can't tell the proxy about you.

234
235
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,580
So with that, I'd like to invite Rory McGuire to
come up on stage and tell you some specific details

235
236
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:33,510
about Bonjour and multitasking in iPhone OS.

236
237
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:38,690
[ Applause ]

237
238
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,200
>> Rory McGuire: Thank you Stuart.

238
239
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,980
My name is Rory and I'm here to help
you learn about Bonjour on iPhone OS.

239
240
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,640
Specifically, we're going to go over three things.

240
241
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,290
First is peer-to-peer networking, something
that Stuart talked about a little bit.

241
242
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,240
I'll go into a little bit more detail.

242
243
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,080
The second is a new API in iOS 4
called DNSServiceSetDispatchQueue.

243
244
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,790
It's in our low-level C API and it allows
you to use GCD queues with Bonjour.

244
245
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,760
It'll make things a lot easier for you, I'll get into that.

245
246
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:17,040
And the new hotness for iOS 4 multitasking and what
that means for Bonjour and networking in general.

246
247
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,350
Let's get to it.

247
248
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,990
Peer-to-peer, this is something that we
introduced last year with iPhone OS 3.

248
249
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:27,890
You may know this as being used by Game Kit.

249
250
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,400
Well, what does it actually do?

250
251
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,740
I'm sure we're all familiar with this Wi-Fi
selection UI, Wi-Fi network selection UI.

251
252
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,820
Which network do I pick, right?

252
253
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:44,510
Let's say for example that you're in a room with 576 MiFis.

253
254
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:49,640
If I wanna use my game or use my service,
which one of these things do I pick?

254
255
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,380
Well, we're going to solve that with no configuration.

255
256
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,930
How are we going to do it?

256
257
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:57,780
Bluetooth.

257
258
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,540
But wait a second.

258
259
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:02,120
This is the Bonjour session, what
are we doing talking about Bluetooth?

259
260
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,360
Well it's Bonjour over Bluetooth.

260
261
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,990
Again, like Stuart said, there's no manual pairing.

261
262
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:15,190
Bonjour will automatically make the
devices connect when you do a resolve.

262
263
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:19,280
Again, this is used by Game Kit but
it's not required that you use Game Kit.

263
264
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,680
You only really have to use the Bonjour APIs.

264
265
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:27,240
So if you already have the Bonjour APIs in your
app, you will get the Bluetooth stuff for free.

265
266
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,470
How is it the same?

266
267
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:37,400
Exactly the same APIs, NSNetService APIs,
CFNetService APIs and the dns_sd low-level C API.

267
268
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,480
Your code will just work.

268
269
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,710
How was it different?

269
270
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:49,030
Well, Stuart talked a little bit about how Bonjour
actually separates browsing from resolving.

270
271
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:53,400
This really worked well for us
to implement this over Bluetooth.

271
272
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:59,050
Resolves may take a little bit longer because that's what
actually tells Bonjour to bring up the IP connection,

272
273
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,960
the PAN connection between the two devices.

273
274
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,250
So one of the things that you're going to want
to is make sure you use ResolveWithTimeout.0.

274
275
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:12,850
It's going to take a little bit longer
than a connection, a resolve over Wi-Fi.

275
276
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:18,050
Let the user decide when they've waited
long enough for this thing to come up.

276
277
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,700
That's about it.

277
278
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,610
So, let's go to little more detail about
the separation between browse and resolve.

278
279
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:30,710
Browsing gets you a little bit of
information about a lot of service instances.

279
280
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,290
It gets you the name of lots and lots of service instances.

280
281
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:40,500
Resolve on the other hand gets you a little bit of info or
gets a lot of information about one particular instance.

281
282
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,400
And in the case of Bonjour over Bluetooth, it
also brings up the Bluetooth PAN connection

282
283
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,830
which is kind of a heavyweight operation.

283
284
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:55,140
What you don't want to do is resolve every single service
that you find in the browse because that's going to fill

284
285
00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:00,090
in the whole table and it's going to be very costly.

285
286
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:06,130
Don't browse continuously because that also
has some power and performance implications.

286
287
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,520
Don't resolve every service.

287
288
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,670
You can get a little bit more information about
the services by querying for the TXT record.

288
289
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:18,050
There are APIs at the NS and CF layer to get the
TXT record for the services that your browses return

289
290
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:21,490
so you can display a little bit
more information to the user.

290
291
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,450
But let your user decide which
service they want to connect to.

291
292
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,960
Don't just go off connecting to every single service because
you're going to be telling Bluetooth to go off and connect

292
293
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,590
to these different PAN connections if
the thing was discovered over Bluetooth.

293
294
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:38,100
You don't want your app to be known as
the one that drains the user's battery.

294
295
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:47,080
Not to be outdone, the Wi-Fi guys are actually
working on something called Wi-Fi Direct.

295
296
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:52,700
This is currently scheduled to have Bonjour in it.

296
297
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:59,560
Alright, it does some exchange with these people
to actually have this work as well using Bonjour.

297
298
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,670
What that's going to mean for you is
that you'll just use the Bonjour APIs.

298
299
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:06,480
Just like over Bluetooth, it's just going to work.

299
300
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,170
But of course, it's not out yet.

300
301
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:15,620
Next topic, DNSServiceSetDispatchQueue.

301
302
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:21,740
This a new API in iOS 4 and it's actually quite nice.

302
303
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,480
It's very, very simple.

303
304
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:30,010
You have a DNSServiceRef and you tell it,
this is the queue I want to put it on.

304
305
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,790
Before this API, when you use the
low-level C APIs for Bonjour,

305
306
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:39,010
you would have to create a CF socket
run loop source or you would have

306
307
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,510
to have your own kqueue loop or your own select loop.

307
308
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:45,530
You'd have to call DNSServiceProcessResult
or all these things you had to do

308
309
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:48,700
in order to get it to work with the C API.

309
310
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,410
Now, however, it's going to be just one line of code, right?

310
311
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:56,430
You start up your browse like you did previously,
but now instead of creating and putting something

311
312
00:23:56,430 --> 00:24:02,350
in your select loop and calling
DNSServiceProcessResult or creating a CFRunLoop source,

312
313
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:08,710
all you have to do is call the SetDispatchQueue with
your DNSServiceRef and the queue you want to put it on.

313
314
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:12,060
In most cases, it's going to be the main queue.

314
315
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:18,820
Now if you're new to iPhone development or
actually you're just new to iPhone OS 4, to iOS 4,

315
316
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,740
GCD is seriously the coolest thing since sliced bread.

316
317
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,380
I love GCD.

317
318
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:29,610
There is the GCD on iOS session immediately
following this one in Russian Hill.

318
319
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:32,760
I invite everybody to attend that, please.

319
320
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,510
That's it for that API.

320
321
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,100
It's really simple.

321
322
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,380
Now on to the new hotness, multitasking.

322
323
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:42,870
So we're going to go through a timeline here.

323
324
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:46,290
What happens when your-- a standard multitask in your app.

324
325
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,870
Now, there's some other kinds of apps you can be.

325
326
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:48,820
You can be a VoIP app.

326
327
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,360
You can do some things with locations, things like that.

327
328
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,320
I'm not going to cover those.

328
329
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,560
Those are covered by the multitasking sessions.

329
330
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,400
I'm going to talk about general networking
in applications that are not VoIP

330
331
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,730
and not doing audio streaming and things like that.

331
332
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:06,430
The first thing that's going to happen when the
user hits the Home button is that you're going

332
333
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:11,150
to get the applicationDidEnterBackground
callback on you application delegate.

333
334
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:15,510
At some point after that, your
code is going to stop running.

334
335
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:19,430
Now, you can request a task completion and
that'll extent the amount of time that you get

335
336
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,380
to run but not really all that much, right.

336
337
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:28,080
At some point, your app is going to be
not be scheduled anymore by the kernel.

337
338
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,190
There is no indication when your
application actually stops running.

338
339
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:37,470
The only indication that you get is that
your application did enter the background.

339
340
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:44,490
Some point after your application stops running,
your Bonjour operations may be canceled.

340
341
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:51,640
In order for us to do very efficient and effective
multitasking, the system is going to reclaim resources.

341
342
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,950
Not necessarily always but it does this
so that the other applications that are

342
343
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:59,690
in the foreground can actually get a much better experience.

343
344
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,910
The other thing it may do is reclaim
the actual networking sockets.

344
345
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,020
Now, it's not actually going to close your sockets.

345
346
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:12,510
It's going to do something much more akin to a
shutdown and you don't know it's happening, right.

346
347
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,620
Your application is not actually running right now.

347
348
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:19,850
You're not scheduled on the processor so you have no
idea that this is going on and that this happened.

348
349
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,210
And again, it doesn't always happen.

349
350
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:24,870
This is when the system decides to reclaim some resources.

350
351
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:29,020
So at some point in the future here, your
code is actually going to resume running.

351
352
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,140
But again, you don't really get any
kind of notification this is happening.

352
353
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,940
You're just going to get scheduled again
and your code's going to start running.

353
354
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:42,030
What's important to note here is this is when you should
deal with the aftermath of these things happening, right.

354
355
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:48,700
This is where you need to be robust to errors on your
networking sockets, errors in you Bonjour operations,

355
356
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:56,790
all these things, because this may actually happen depending
on scheduling before you get applicationWillEnterForeground.

356
357
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:01,760
Do not use applicationWillEnterForeground as a
notification that you need to clean up your world.

357
358
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,650
Your world may be dirty before that because
your application actually started running

358
359
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:09,280
on the processor before you got this callback.

359
360
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,310
Now, in general you should be robust
to network issues, right?

360
361
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,020
This is not just multitasking.

361
362
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:22,640
I can walk across the room and now I'm closer to this set
of MiFis so my networking is going to be busted, right.

362
363
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,380
So just the usual walking around
might have effects on networking.

363
364
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:32,970
So be robust to networking issues, right including things
that happen when you get resumed after multitasking,

364
365
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:36,400
after going in the background and coming back up.

365
366
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,230
So merely building with iOS 4 gets you this behavior, right?

366
367
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:45,820
Your application will go into the
background, it will get suspended.

367
368
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:51,610
After a resume, all your Bonjour
networking may be broken for your app.

368
369
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,220
You'll no longer be advertising anything.

369
370
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,250
You'll no longer be discovering anything.

370
371
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:58,690
Your network sockets might be closed.

371
372
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:06,400
Detect and fix that broken state or the user experience with
your app is going to be worse than it was with iPhone OS 3.

372
373
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,730
This is very, very important, right?

373
374
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:15,190
There's no UI for users to go exit your app, at least
no UI that they're really going to understand, right.

374
375
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,690
There's no Quit button.

375
376
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:20,930
There's nothing that says I want
you to relaunch my app from scratch.

376
377
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:26,390
If your app doesn't clean up the first time it
resumes, your app is going to be dead in the water.

377
378
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:31,280
When the user switches back to your app at anytime
in the future, you don't want it to be host, right.

378
379
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,210
You want it to work again.

379
380
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,500
So be robust to these kinds of errors
even if you're not getting a resume.

380
381
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,800
You might get networking errors for other reasons.

381
382
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:46,630
So if you're using the NSNetService or the CFNetService
APIs, you'll get called back with an error code.

382
383
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:51,720
When you get callback with that error code, restart
your Bonjour operations if that's where you are,

383
384
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,470
if that's where you want your user to be.

384
385
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,130
Again, you shouldn't be browsing all the time.

385
386
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:58,770
You should be browsing or resolving
when the user actually wants

386
387
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:03,030
to because there are some power
implications and things like that.

387
388
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:07,720
With the lower-level C APIs, if you're
calling DNSServiceProcessResult yourself,

388
389
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,530
check for the return code ServiceNotRunning
and then restart your Bonjour operations.

389
390
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:19,390
If you're using the new SetDispatchQueue, it will
call all your callbacks with ServiceNotRunning

390
391
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:22,980
because again you're not calling
DNSServiceProcessResult yourself.

391
392
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,040
You're letting all the cool dispatch
stuff take care of that for you.

392
393
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,370
When you get ServiceNotRunning,
restart all your Bonjour operations.

393
394
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:35,540
If you're using the low-level C APIs, we highly
recommend that you use the new SetDispatchQueue API

394
395
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,550
because it allows for us to do future improvements, right?

395
396
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,600
In the future, we could automatically
start all the things back up for you

396
397
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,080
and you will not even get errors when you resume.

397
398
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:53,720
And the last thing is you can actually opt out of
this behavior by adding this thing to your info.plist.

398
399
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,510
And now back to Stuart.

399
400
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:04,990
[ Applause ]

400
401
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:08,960
>> Stuart Cheshire: Thank you Rory.

401
402
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:17,310
So, in other news we just released Bonjour for Windows
2.0.2 and this brings Bonjour on Windows to feature parity

402
403
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:22,970
with Bonjour on Mac OS 10.6, Snow Leopard.

403
404
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:26,940
It's installed with iTunes on Windows, with Safari.

404
405
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:34,310
Now with Bonjour Print Services which lets
Windows machines share printers on your Mac.

405
406
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:41,590
There's an SDK for developers which gives you
additional tools and the header files, the documentation.

406
407
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:45,880
One of the key new things which you will be happy

407
408
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,720
about if you're a Windows developer is
we have the new shared connection mode.

408
409
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,880
And I'll talk in a minute about why that's useful.

409
410
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,850
We have some stuff code to do weak-linking.

410
411
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,410
I'll explain that.

411
412
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:01,680
And it also supports Sleep Proxy just like Snow Leopard.

412
413
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,410
You might ask why does Apple do Bonjour for Windows?

413
414
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:12,550
Well, we want a world where network
products talk to each other effortlessly.

414
415
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:22,870
And a lot of you guys are making applications for the iPhone
and a lot of those applications may want to synchronize data

415
416
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:26,910
with information on the user's home computer.

416
417
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:32,720
And we don't want you to have to do one set of
things for Macs and something different for Windows.

417
418
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:39,820
So, you can use the same network protocol, a very
efficient, mature, robust service discovery protocol

418
419
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:46,660
and have that available on Windows as well.

419
420
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:52,520
On Mac OS X, adding event source to your run
loop is very easy and every Bonjour operation

420
421
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,450
in the original API stands alone as its own event source.

421
422
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:01,940
The feedback we have from Windows programmers
is that it's not so easy on Windows.

422
423
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:08,540
The way you typically program on Windows is you make the
list of sources you're waiting for then you tell Windows

423
424
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,640
to wait for something interesting
to happen with one of those sources

424
425
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:17,530
and then when it returns you process the events.

425
426
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:22,580
But having-- creating a new operation while
you're waiting means you've got to break out of

426
427
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,990
that loop and make a new list and go back into it.

427
428
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:25,950
And it's possible to do.

428
429
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:29,360
Many people have done it but it is extra work.

429
430
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:39,180
So, we have this new mode which is also available on Snow
Leopard and iOS which is where you make a shared connection

430
431
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:43,730
and then you can add new Bonjour operations
to that one shared connection which means

431
432
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:50,900
on application startup you make a single Windows events
source, put that in your WaitForMultipleObjects list

432
433
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:55,380
and then you don't have to keep
adding and removing event sources.

433
434
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:04,690
The way that works is first you call createConnection
on startup and then you copy that DNSServiceRef

434
435
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:08,210
and do a new operation passing the shared connection flag.

435
436
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:12,810
You can make another copy of that
service ref and start another operation.

436
437
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:20,270
Each operation can have a different callback
function to handle the events or as in this case,

437
438
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:24,630
they both have the same reply function
but they have a different context pointer

438
439
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:30,760
which is how the reply function knows which particular
event has just happened relating to which operation.

439
440
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,920
Typically, this context pointer would
be a pointer to your object or structure

440
441
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:40,910
or something else defining the state
of that operation you're doing.

441
442
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:46,550
I always like to show things at the developer conference
which are not made by Apple because this is an open standard

442
443
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:50,860
and I'm always interested to see what
the other developers are doing with it.

443
444
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:55,020
RealVNC is now using Bonjour in
their Windows and iPad products.

444
445
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:58,360
I am going to show you that.

445
446
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:09,370
Their server for Windows advertises with Bonjour and
their client on the iPad uses Bonjour to discover servers.

446
447
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:13,630
RealVNC is using the weak-linking
capability that I talked about.

447
448
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:20,810
On the Mac, since the day before OS X,
we had this concept called weak-linking.

448
449
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:28,400
You could write an app that linked to some feature
that was new in Mac OS 10.6 and if the user ran it

449
450
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,430
on 10.5 they wouldn't get a DLL link error.

450
451
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:37,480
The application would still launch but its functions
would be effectively like null function pointers.

451
452
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:43,490
And you as a developer could know that and check
those functions were not null before you called them

452
453
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,470
and that way your application would still run.

453
454
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:50,110
It just might miss some of the new functionality
but it's not going to fail to launch.

454
455
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,940
It came as a surprise to us that Windows doesn't have that.

455
456
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:59,450
So, that means developers have to roll their own
functionality and again this was feedback we heard

456
457
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:04,030
from developers and in Bonjour for
Windows 2.0, we do that for you.

457
458
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:10,530
We have helpers to help you link in your library and
it does the DLL calls to see if Bonjour is installed

458
459
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:17,960
and if it's not installed then when you call the function
you get an error and so it uses that so you don't have

459
460
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,090
to have Bonjour installed to use their
server and if it's not installed,

460
461
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:27,510
their server will try to advertise the service and
get an error and it will continue and run correctly.

461
462
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:30,910
But if Bonjour is installed then
the server will advertise with it.

462
463
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:35,920
So let's see if I can show you that now.

463
464
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:49,200
Okay, so, I have my machine here
running Windows and I have my iPad.

464
465
00:35:50,570 --> 00:36:01,750
I will-- this is the RealVNC VNCViewer and I can run
this and this is the out of the box configuration.

465
466
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,960
Let's see what's available on the network.

466
467
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,060
And without typing in any configuration information,

467
468
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:13,240
this has used Bonjour to find a
couple of VNC servers it can talk to.

468
469
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,710
This version displays the IP address.

469
470
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:23,280
You wouldn't do that in a normal application but one
thing you will notice here is those addresses say 169.254

470
471
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,700
and I'm pointing that out because I'm
not connected to any of the network here.

471
472
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,610
This is just on my laptop here.

472
473
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:35,040
I created a wireless network and on the iPad I joined it.

473
474
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,050
There is no DXUP server.

474
475
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:40,020
This is a TCP/IP network with 2 devices on it.

475
476
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,180
They pick their own link local
addresses, they use Multicast DNS.

476
477
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:52,860
They've discovered each other and this is a common developer
mistake to say wait, I better use the reachability APIs

477
478
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,220
and make sure I can talk to the internet and oh no, I can't.

478
479
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:58,360
I'm going to put up an error messages and refuse to work.

479
480
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:03,260
You don't need to talk to the great
mainframe in the sky to do useful networking.

480
481
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,280
Quite often you may have a device
that you just want to set up

481
482
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,640
and VNC could be a great way of
doing that and talking to that.

482
483
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,420
The reachability APIs are a great way to notify you.

483
484
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:20,760
If you try to connect and you fail, you
can use reachability to get a notification

484
485
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,730
about when the network environment has changed.

485
486
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:25,060
So it might be good time to try again.

486
487
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:30,810
But there are terrible preflight checks
because they can only ever make things worse.

487
488
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:33,980
If you just try to connect you will either succeed or fail.

488
489
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:41,730
If you use reachability as a preflight check before
that it can't ever make a failed connection succeed.

489
490
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:47,740
A connection that would have failed will still fail but it
can make you not try in a case that would have succeeded.

490
491
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:53,370
So general lesson here and I highly recommend going

491
492
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:58,220
to the sessions this afternoon at
networking on iPhone OS, two parts.

492
493
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:05,540
They cover a lot of details about dealing with networking in
a modern world, particularly networking on mobile devices.

493
494
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:09,240
I recommend those.

494
495
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:20,960
And let's see what happens when I connect to this.

495
496
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:32,630
And so, with zero-configuration I have just
discovered and connected from an Apple iPad device

496
497
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:38,510
to a Microsoft Windows machine
and you saw how easy that was.

497
498
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:45,020
For any of you guys who've set up things like network
cameras and tried to configure IP address and things.

498
499
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:48,250
You know it can be something that you
planned half a Saturday afternoon for.

499
500
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:53,510
With Bonjour you just connect and
it works, so let's move on.

500
501
00:38:53,510 --> 00:39:00,530
[ Applause ]

501
502
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:05,680
So I have-- this is not a shipping
product yet but I'm very excited.

502
503
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,510
Oh I'm sorry, I'm getting ahead.

503
504
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:19,640
So, you all know that the iPhone uses
WebKit as its HTML rendering engine.

504
505
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:26,360
And I'm sure you know that Palm devices
and Android phones use WebKit as well.

505
506
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:33,630
And you know that iPhone OS uses
Bonjour for its service discovery.

506
507
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:40,500
Well I'm very happy to say that last month at
Palm's developers conference they announced

507
508
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:49,870
that Palm will also be supporting the Bonjour APIs
and you can already get Android apps that use Bonjour

508
509
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:54,090
by embedding a Java implementation of
Bonjour but by the end of the year,

509
510
00:39:54,090 --> 00:40:00,910
I'm told that Android OS will have Bonjour APIs itself
so that every app doesn't have to embed its own copy.

510
511
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:05,880
So, you could use the same HTML
5 on all these mobile platforms

511
512
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:11,300
and you can use the same Bonjour service
discovery on all these mobile platforms.

512
513
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:18,140
Now I'm sure many people in this room have probably
experimented with the technology called X10.

513
514
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:25,300
For those of you who don't know, it's a power line signaling
mechanism that's been around since the '70s, I think.

514
515
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,830
And the idea is great.

515
516
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:31,220
You can have a little module that you plug into
the wall and you plug your table lamp into it.

516
517
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,560
And then you could have another device, a switch connected

517
518
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,980
to the power lines that's not mechanically
switching the power on and off.

518
519
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:44,860
It's sending signals over the power line to tell that
module to turn the lights on or off or brighten or dim.

519
520
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:51,830
And this is a great idea for being more flexible
about how you control things in your house.

520
521
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:54,520
But the protocol is slow and unreliable.

521
522
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,380
There's no acknowledgment.

522
523
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,970
There's no retransmission.

523
524
00:40:56,970 --> 00:41:00,540
So, for a lot of people it's a very frustrating experience.

524
525
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:04,410
The promise is there but the reality
doesn't really live up to it.

525
526
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:10,540
And time is long overdue I think for something
that is like X10 but works a lot better.

526
527
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:18,370
These products and they are not on sale yet
so I'm not going to give the company name

527
528
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:21,450
but look for these in the shops by Christmas, I hope.

528
529
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:29,440
This is little module you plug in the power outlet and they
have Wi-Fi in them and Bonjour and there's an iPhone app

529
530
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:36,760
which uses Bonjour to discover all of these modules
wirelessly, not over the power line over Wi-Fi.

530
531
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:42,590
And from the iPhone app you can tell it to turn
on or off or brighten or dim but the difference

531
532
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:50,850
because this is Wi-Fi is you don't press brighten
4 times and two of the packets got lost so you have

532
533
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:53,850
to press a few more times to reach the right brightness.

533
534
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:57,220
That kind of worked when a human is doing it
but when a computer is controlling things,

534
535
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:02,050
it can't tell how bright the light is by looking
at it so you really need something reliable.

535
536
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:08,320
So, you can send commands to the module to
turn on and turn off and brighten and dim.

536
537
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:13,570
That circle on the front is actually
a push button so you can override it.

537
538
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:17,520
So, if you don't want to dig out your phone
you can press the button to turn it on and off.

538
539
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,480
And because it's all software controlled when you press
that button, it can signal back to the app on your iPhone

539
540
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,260
or your computer that the button was
pushed which you can use as a trigger

540
541
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,220
to turn other things on or off in the house.

541
542
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,370
These things also have a power meter in them.

542
543
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:35,320
Some of the people in this room have probably
bought power meters because they are curious

543
544
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,610
about how much power their television and
their computer and their printer take.

544
545
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:41,720
Well, these have power metering built into them.

545
546
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,410
So you don't need a separate box with an LCD display.

546
547
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:49,030
Just on your iPhone screen, you can see the amount
of power that's being consumed by each device plugged

547
548
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:55,390
into these things and even chart it overtime to
see the refrigerator compressor cycling on and off.

548
549
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:59,160
And you can use that as a trigger for
events so that when you turn the television

549
550
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:06,410
on it senses the increased power draw and sends messages
to other modules to tell them to turn off the lights

550
551
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:12,200
and turn on the amplifier and you can build all
of these things that communicate with each other

551
552
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,820
and automate things in your home over Wi-Fi using Bonjour.

552
553
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:19,970
So, the whole Bonjour team is very excited
about this and we're going to be first

553
554
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:22,690
in line to buy these as soon as they go on sale.

554
555
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:30,100
This was exactly the kind of thing that I hoped to see
happen when we started the Bonjour effort ten years ago.

555
556
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:37,680
Bonjour is not just about desktop Macs and PCs, although
it's certainly good that we make those easier to use

556
557
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,530
but where it's critically important is
devices like this where you can't hook

557
558
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,600
up a screen and a keyboard to configure them.

558
559
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:50,150
They absolutely have to be bullet proof and self
configuring and you can't afford the tech support costs

559
560
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:52,400
of people calling up trying to
work at how to configure them.

560
561
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,250
You have to just have them plug in and work.

561
562
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,560
So with that, I'll get to our tips and reminders.

562
563
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:06,330
You've heard this in other sessions
and I'm going to repeat it here.

563
564
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:08,180
Make sure your applications work with IPv6.

564
565
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:17,590
IPv4 has link-local addressing but it was
kind of an add-on after the fact to IPv4.

565
566
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:22,280
IPv6 has had it built-in from the start
and the API supports it more elegantly.

566
567
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,080
So, we wholeheartedly recommend IPv6.

567
568
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:30,980
We use IPv6 in our own base stations,
that's how you configure AirPort Express is

568
569
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:35,350
with an IPv6 link-local address to communicate with it.

569
570
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:39,900
You'll hear this message in the iPhone networking sessions.

570
571
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,690
Networking is asynchronous.

571
572
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:46,270
Things don't always in the real world
like they might work in your lab.

572
573
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:48,470
Here's one example.

573
574
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:54,540
If you do asynchronous blocking DNS call on your main
thread and the DNS server happens to be not responsive

574
575
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:58,690
for that user, the standard DNS time matches 30 seconds.

575
576
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:02,770
Well, your app will get jettisoned
after 20 seconds if it's not responsive.

576
577
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:05,520
So, your app dies.

577
578
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,350
People say why don't you just make the timeout shorter?

578
579
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:11,060
But that really isn't the answer because
even having your app unresponsive

579
580
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:15,470
for 5 seconds is not a good user experience for the user.

580
581
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:20,240
And 5 seconds may not be long enough for a slow DNS server.

581
582
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:24,110
So, the answer is not synchronous blocking
calls and trying to get the time out right.

582
583
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:28,810
The answer is to embrace the fact
that networking is asynchronous.

583
584
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:36,580
Do things on a background thread or even better,
do things in an event driven basis using CFRunLoop

584
585
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:40,820
or using the new libdispatch Grand Central Scheduling.

585
586
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:48,470
Some that we see sometimes in Windows applications
is a Refresh button and we don't want to see

586
587
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:54,290
that in Bonjour applications on Mac or Windows and
if you think about the iChat Bonjour Buddy List think

587
588
00:45:54,290 --> 00:46:00,470
about the sidebar on iTunes, think about the
Safari Bonjour list, there's no Refresh button.

588
589
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:02,790
The list should always be fresh.

589
590
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:05,880
So, the Bonjour APIs make this very easy.

590
591
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:12,480
You start to browse you get out and remove
events for the lifetime of that browse.

591
592
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,440
You don't have to have a timer the way you do when
you browse every minute to see what's changed.

592
593
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:21,080
We've seen applications that do a browse for 10
seconds and then stop and then another one and then--

593
594
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:25,990
That's actually harder on the network than just leaving
the browse running because the browse settles off

594
595
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:32,900
to a low query rate and then just pays
attention to the events on the network.

595
596
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:39,080
Generally, we recommend using the window so when the user
wants to connect to a service you may have a UI today

596
597
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,810
where there's a field where they type in the host name.

597
598
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:48,470
Well, you can still have that but next to that you can
have a Bonjour button which brings up a browsing list.

598
599
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:53,400
And for the time that list is on
the screen it should be live.

599
600
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,720
And then the user closes it and you stop the browse.

600
601
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:03,990
We prefer a window to a pull down menu because while the
APIs exist from modifying a pull down menu while it's

601
602
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:06,780
on the screen, it's disconcerting to use this.

602
603
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:10,690
They're not really used to pulling down a menu and
seeing all the things jumble around and change.

603
604
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:14,530
So we recommend using a window not a pull down menu.

604
605
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:18,470
The way your client will discover instances of your service

605
606
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:22,160
and not other services is that
every service has a unique name.

606
607
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,380
You don't have to pay to register this.

607
608
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:30,230
Just go to dns-sd.org and make sure you
register a unique identifier for your service.

608
609
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:37,870
We often see in the wild on networks like WWDC here,
we look at the services that are being advertised

609
610
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:41,180
and we always see a few that aren't
on the service type list.

610
611
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:50,330
So, save yourself headaches by just going to that
webpage, send the email, register your service type.

611
612
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:54,860
In the first version of Bonjour many
years ago we had a domain parameter.

612
613
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:58,950
And it was there for future expansion
but it wasn't used at the time.

613
614
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:05,510
Now, that we have wide area Bonjour and Back
to My Mac, don't ignore the domain parameter.

614
615
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:13,830
When you do a browse you get back name, type, domain, and
the interface index and you need to store all of those

615
616
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:18,450
or at least name, type, and domain and pass
those three unchanged to the resolve call.

616
617
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:26,610
We have seen bugs where people ignore the domain or they
just hard code local and that works with local Bonjour

617
618
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:30,880
but you're losing the benefits
of Back to My Mac if you do that.

618
619
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:33,780
Don't ignore the port number.

619
620
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:37,730
Historically, networking has had
the concept of well-known ports.

620
621
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:40,150
Port80 is the web server.

621
622
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:44,090
Well, you can only have one port80 on a machine.

622
623
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:48,030
So with fast user switching, if there's
multiple application and multiple copies

623
624
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:51,470
of the same application running they
can't all have the same port number.

624
625
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:57,360
There are a lot of bits to software today
that use a webpage as their configuration UI

625
626
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:01,270
which is great but again, they can't all have port80.

626
627
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:08,150
When you've got multiple computers at home behind
the NAT Gateway, they're all sharing one IP address.

627
628
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:11,120
There's only one port80 on that IP address.

628
629
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:18,680
So, we knew this was going to happen and that's why the
Bonjour resolve call gives you back the port number.

629
630
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:27,790
When you create your service, you can specify 0 when you
bind and the kernel will pick an unused port for you.

630
631
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:33,590
The register API has a parameter for you to say
what port number you're listening on and that goes

631
632
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:38,020
into the network packets and the resolve call
will tell the clients we have seen applications.

632
633
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:39,360
They do the resolve.

633
634
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,770
They get back the address in the port.

634
635
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:46,080
They ignore the port and try to connect to the
well-known ports and that only works if you get lucky.

635
636
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:50,170
The first copy of the application may get
the port at once but all the others won't.

636
637
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:57,780
So, this creates situations with Back to My Mac or with
other wide area Bonjour things where you can only connect

637
638
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,410
to one thing at the group but the other ones that aren't

638
639
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:04,510
on the standard port don't work when
they connect to the wrong thing.

639
640
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:11,920
For your marketing materials and
your packaging and your webpages,

640
641
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:19,460
if you use Bonjour then you can license the Bonjour
logo for no cost just like the Made for iPhone

641
642
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:24,290
and Made for iPad logos to let your customers
know that they can expect a painless,

642
643
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:28,370
trouble-fee experience with your products.

643
644
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:35,640
If you're using the Bonjour APIs on Mac
and Windows then you are good to go.

644
645
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:42,460
If you are building pieces of hardware which we love to see
then we have a Bonjour conformance test which you can run

645
646
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:46,220
to help you find bugs in your implementation and if you pass

646
647
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:50,980
that test then you can also use
the Bonjour logo on your packaging.

647
648
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:55,390
And I encourage you to run that test
because it does help you find bugs

648
649
00:50:55,390 --> 00:51:00,120
that might cause trouble for customers in the field.

649
650
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:05,490
If you are doing something where you want a component
that runs on Windows you can license Bonjour for Windows

650
651
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:10,030
and that is also free with iTunes being on so many machines.

651
652
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:15,910
There are a hundred million copies of Bonjour for Windows
already out there so you may not even have to install it

652
653
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:21,270
but if you want to include that with your
software you can license that for no fee.

653
654
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:26,900
Safari on Windows has the same Bonjour
browsing that Safari on Mac OS X does.

654
655
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:39,130
So to wrap up, especially with things like
peer-to-peer over Bluetooth on the phone,

655
656
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:45,840
having an app that's constantly browsing all the
time in the background has a toll in battery life.

656
657
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:52,170
So, when the user hits the button to bring up your browsing
list you start the browse and then leave the browse live

657
658
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:55,150
so they're getting live information
but when the user dismisses, it stops.

658
659
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:57,290
That's what we recommend.

659
660
00:51:57,290 --> 00:52:01,700
We know that not all apps from
Apple set the best example here.

660
661
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:07,520
iTunes has the sidebar that's browsing all
the time but particularly on the phone,

661
662
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,880
we recommend browsing when the user
is actually actively looking for stuff

662
663
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,890
but otherwise, don't be browsing all the time.

663
664
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:19,100
And in the same vein, don't resolve everything
you find because that could be very expensive.

664
665
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:26,010
You're triggering a whole bunch of mechanism by
resolving there that you really don't need to trigger

665
666
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:29,900
until you're actually ready to make a connection.

666
667
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:33,460
Embrace the fact that networking is asynchronous.

667
668
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:40,000
It can seem like a pain if you're used to non-network
programming where the computer is in charge

668
669
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,310
where you say do this and then do this and then do this

669
670
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:47,180
and you'll write nice sequential
programs the way we all learn to program.

670
671
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:53,280
But networking like graphical user interfaces
is one area where you are not in charge.

671
672
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,460
In GUIs, the user is deciding what
button to click next and in networking,

672
673
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:01,150
the environment around you is deciding
what's going to happen next.

673
674
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:06,210
And fighting against that is really unproductive.

674
675
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:11,370
Pay attention to the multitasking
issues that Rory told you about.

675
676
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:16,650
You have to pay attention to the network sockets
being broken because otherwise when your app resumes,

676
677
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:22,270
it may not work and with no easy way for the user to quit
it, we don't want to be in a situation where users end

677
678
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:29,250
up rebooting their phone because they don't know
how to fix the broken apps and use the Bonjour logo.

678
679
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:35,980
This is the contact information
for our technology evangelists.

679
680
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:39,460
We have documentation on the webpage.

680
681
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:41,870
In the interest of full disclosure,
I was co-author on this book.

681
682
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:45,940
This is the O'Reilly Zero Configuration
Networking book which is a--

682
683
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:56,940
I'd like to say it's a more cohesive form of documentation
in the sense that you can read it safely in the bathtub.
