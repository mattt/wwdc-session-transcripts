1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,290
>> Welcome.

1
2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,690
I'm glad to see so many people interested in Game Center.

2
3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:16,810
We're going to talk about some techniques
on how you enable your Game Center game.

3
4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:23,400
I'm guessing most of you are around for
Mike's session that was just before.

4
5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:30,300
But I'll go over a simple review of what Game Center is.

5
6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:39,940
And then I'll go into some details about how you actually
turn your games, your applications, into Game Center.

6
7
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,610
I'm Gabriel.

7
8
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,100
I'm part of the team.

8
9
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,110
We're here all week.

9
10
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,500
We have a lab.

10
11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:54,080
Tomorrow we have another session in this room right
after this where we'll be going into some more details.

11
12
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,340
So, Game Center.

12
13
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,170
Game Center is Apple's social gaming community.

13
14
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:08,050
It provides a whole bunch of features:
friends, friends' lists.

14
15
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:13,180
It allows you to play with your friends;
compete with your friends offline and online

15
16
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:18,050
through leaderboards, achievements, and multiplayer gaming.

16
17
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,470
Peer-to-peer multiplayer gaming is really neat.

17
18
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,600
You'll see more of that later today.

18
19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,900
I'm going to be focusing more on
the first three of those slides --

19
20
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,520
bullet points: friends, leaderboards, achievements.

20
21
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,940
What you're going to learn today, Game Center API basics.

21
22
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:41,640
I'll go over a little bit about how our API is
structured, how we can use this in some simple cases,

22
23
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,780
how to authenticate, how you can remember.

23
24
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,430
You can use the player ID, which was mentioned before.

24
25
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,120
It's persistent.

25
26
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,620
You can use this to remember your
players across different sessions.

26
27
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,130
You can store data.

27
28
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:01,140
I'll show you how you can report high scores, how
you can access and show a leaderboard in game,

28
29
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,840
how you can access the data from a leaderboard
if you want to use custom UI, and achievements.

29
30
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,990
So I'll also show you how you can report achievements
from your game; how you can show achievements

30
31
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:23,110
in your game using the standard UI; how to query data
from the achievements, your users' achievements; and,

31
32
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,590
lastly, how to reset a user's achievements.

32
33
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,190
We've seen this slide.

33
34
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,520
It's an overview of what Game Center actually looks like.

34
35
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,560
There's a Game Center application.

35
36
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,690
Obviously, there's Your Games.

36
37
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,310
And the GameKit framework.

37
38
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,680
The GameKit framework is comprised
of three different pieces.

38
39
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,630
There's parts that are only available
from the Game Center application.

39
40
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,340
There's the piece in the middle which we're calling General,

40
41
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,720
which is Authentication, Friends,
Leaderboards, and Achievements.

41
42
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,730
That's what I'm going to be focusing on in this session.

42
43
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,120
And, lastly, there's the Multiplayer features
which we'll go over in the next session.

43
44
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:07,770
So I'm going to be focusing on these four things today, and
I'll be going through each of these sections in more detail.

44
45
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,790
To start off with, I want to take a
little digression and talk about blocks.

45
46
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,610
Blocks are new in iOS4.

46
47
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,180
They were introduced in Snow Leopard.

47
48
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,190
A block is essentially an anonymous function.

48
49
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:28,840
In other languages, you might have
heard them called closures or lambdas.

49
50
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,240
You can see here we have declared a block.

50
51
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,490
It's like any other C variable.

51
52
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:40,650
It follows the definition of a function pointer.

52
53
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,260
Instead of using an asterisks, it uses a caret.

53
54
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,670
One of the interesting things is that it
actually captures enclosing variables.

54
55
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,180
So you'll notice in the block where
we make reference to x, y, and z,

55
56
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,590
z being passed in as a parameter, x and y are captured.

56
57
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:03,870
So when we get to this last line,
it will print out 123, 456, 789.

57
58
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:10,720
A note that I want to make, we're
only using static types here.

58
59
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,920
But you can also use objects.

59
60
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:20,500
And when you use objects, when you reference
enclosing objects, it will automatically retain them.

60
61
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:26,490
And there's a particular note that I want to
make about using instance variables because,

61
62
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,840
when you reference an instance variable,
you're making an implicit reference to self.

62
63
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,590
And so self will be retained inside the block.

63
64
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:39,780
If you're also retaining the block inside
the object, then you have a retain loop.

64
65
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:45,000
And this is something that you need to be
concerned about or you should watch for.

65
66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,240
There's a lot more information on blocks.

66
67
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,300
There's another session.

67
68
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,900
I'll give you some details at the end of
here where you can find out about blocks.

68
69
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,080
But we use blocks quite extensively.

69
70
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,940
And I'll show you exactly how we use blocks.

70
71
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:03,660
So this is not a real call but it's
a template of how we're using blocks.

71
72
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,390
We use basically blocks as callbacks.

72
73
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:15,260
Most of the functions in GameKit are asynchronous, which
means that an action is performed and you will be notified

73
74
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,710
at the end once said action has completed.

74
75
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,130
And the way that we do that is we do that using blocks.

75
76
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,980
Here are some of the errors that you'll see.

76
77
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:33,340
GKErrorCancelled will happen if the user decides that
they were going to cancel the event which you started.

77
78
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:40,600
CommunicationsFailure, if we have
trouble; if the network is unresponsive.

78
79
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:49,450
InvalidCredentials, if the user that is using your
game doesn't remember his user name and password.

79
80
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,100
NotAuthenticated, Mike mentioned authentication before.

80
81
00:05:53,100 --> 00:06:02,080
I'll mention again right after here, all the features
of Game Center require that your user is authenticated.

81
82
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,140
AuthenticationInProgress.

82
83
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:11,740
Since authentication is asynchronous, you might be tempted
to try authentication if you're not already authenticated.

83
84
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,960
And you might actually try again.

84
85
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:22,530
If the user is in the middle of authentication and
we receive a call to some function, we'll notify you.

85
86
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:31,590
ScoreNotSet, you'll see when we're dealing with
leaderboards if you try to report a score that has no value.

86
87
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:37,520
ParentalControlsBlocked, something that
you'll get back if there are restrictions.

87
88
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:46,820
We have -- built into the iOS there's restrictions
that can be placed on which features are available.

88
89
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,860
And the last one is a MatchRequestInvalid.

89
90
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:56,020
So when you see matching, which we'll do in the next
session, there are some parameters which you can set

90
91
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:03,350
up with matches, and match has to -- has certain
restrictions about how you can set up a match request.

91
92
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,990
And Nate will go over that.

92
93
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:05,960
So here we are.

93
94
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,870
We're at this list.

94
95
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:12,550
I'm going to focus on authentication, and this
is the first class that I'm going to talk about.

95
96
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,990
This is GKLocalPlayer.

96
97
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:22,320
GKLocalPlayer represents the player
on the device who's playing your game.

97
98
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,330
It has three pieces of information
associated with that player.

98
99
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:32,860
He's got a player ID that is unique and persistent.

99
100
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,950
You can use this to store data about your players.

100
101
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:41,740
You can use this to extend the
community, extend our feature set.

101
102
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,470
You have an alias, which is the
nickname that Mike talked about.

102
103
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,640
It is unique but it's not persistent.

103
104
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,070
The user always has the ability to change their nickname.

104
105
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:59,580
And, then, underage flag to give you an indication that this
user is underage and you might want to behave appropriately.

105
106
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,740
You also use GKLocalPlayer to perform authentication --

106
107
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,980
I'll show you that in just a moment
-- and access your friends' list.

107
108
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,700
So here's the first piece of real code
that we see to perform authentication.

108
109
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:22,920
Authentication is required to use any of the other
features for -- any of the other features of Game Center.

109
110
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:28,520
So you need to do this as early as possible in your game.

110
111
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,160
It may present UI.

111
112
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:36,580
It will give the ability for the user to present their
credentials if they haven't already been authenticated.

112
113
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,570
We share authentication across all games in the Game Center.

113
114
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,180
So it might be that you call authentication
and your user is authenticated.

114
115
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,170
You'll notice this block here, indication of an error.

115
116
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,290
First thing that we need to do is we
need to allocate the local player.

116
117
00:08:53,290 --> 00:09:04,690
We use this -- we do this using a class method called
localPlayer on GKLocalPlayer, and we store it for later use.

117
118
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,650
On this object,

118
119
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:11,980
we now call authenticateWithCompletionHandler,
and we give it a parameter, this block.

119
120
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:16,180
This block is going to get run sometime in the future.

120
121
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,440
It's a callback.

121
122
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,160
We're using them as callbacks instead of delegates.

122
123
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,440
We find this to be much easier
to do and much easier to write.

123
124
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,780
So the actual block of the code gets run at a later time.

124
125
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:34,300
It might look quite linear as your reading it,
but this code actually gets run in the future.

125
126
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:39,860
So here we have the response coming
back from authentication with an error.

126
127
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,090
If there was not an error, that
means your user is authenticated.

127
128
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,660
You should enable your GameKit features.

128
129
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:51,140
You should allow the user to use invites and leaderboards.

129
130
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:58,040
Otherwise, if there has been an error, you
should turn off Game Center Enable Features.

130
131
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,150
Doesn't mean that you should stop your game.

131
132
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,550
Please continue your game.

132
133
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:07,730
Maybe the user has decided that they don't want to play
online or they don't want to use Game Center and features.

133
134
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,310
And they've notified this -- they've
told you this by canceling the operation.

134
135
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,230
But your game should continue on.

135
136
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,920
So this is what it will look like to your user.

136
137
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,380
If he's not already authenticated, he'll be given this
opportunity to either sign in using an existing account

137
138
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,570
that he's already created or to create a new account.

138
139
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:36,550
If he signs in using an existing
account, it's the iTunes account.

139
140
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:41,440
And he's given a place to sign in.

140
141
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,100
If the user's already signed in, has already
been authenticated through another application

141
142
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,800
or having used your game earlier, then you'll
see this welcome back message that comes in.

142
143
00:10:52,800 --> 00:11:01,710
Then you can enable the buttons to do invites, matching,
leaderboards, etc. Now I'm going to talk a little bit

143
144
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:07,940
about friends, how you access your friends'
list, what you can do with the friends' list.

144
145
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,810
And we hit our second class.

145
146
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,260
This one's called GKPlayer.

146
147
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:21,820
GKPlayer represents everybody else in the
community who's not the user on your device.

147
148
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:29,960
We have two pieces of information
that we have about this player.

148
149
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:36,190
We have a player ID, which we can see is persistent.

149
150
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:45,210
You can use it to keep track of data for those users,
and you can keep track of those players over time.

150
151
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:49,790
The alias should be used in your
game to display the user's name.

151
152
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:55,000
So, when you're in a match and you get matched
with somebody, you should use the alias to show -

152
153
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,180
hey, you're now playing with this person.

153
154
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:02,570
This is who's blue, this is who's red, that kind of thing.

154
155
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,900
This is how you get your friends' list.

155
156
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:11,980
The first thing that we need to do
is, again, start with localPlayer.

156
157
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,000
If you've already done this, you could use the same object.

157
158
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,580
We call loadFriendsWithCompletionHandler.

158
159
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:26,400
This block is a little bit different than the last one
that we saw, because it has two parameters in it now:

159
160
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:32,220
one for the array of friends, which gets
returned to you; and one for an error.

160
161
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:38,970
You'll notice in the block where I'm actually
handling both cases, if, for instance,

161
162
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:43,530
there is a communications failure, we
might have that friends' list cached.

162
163
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:47,570
So we'll return that to you, even
though you can't access the server.

163
164
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:51,960
It might be slightly out of date, but
it's the best information that you have,

164
165
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,450
as well as also return you an indication
that there was an error.

165
166
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,610
You should handle both cases.

166
167
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:03,510
So, in this case, the friends' list that's
returned to you is an array of GKPlayers.

167
168
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:10,050
[ Pause ]

168
169
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:10,860
What to do with the friends' list.

169
170
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,740
I've already told you that you can associate custom
data on your own servers with the player IDs.

170
171
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:22,460
And here are some ideas that you can do, you
can use to extend the Game Center functionality.

171
172
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,400
Virtual goods.

172
173
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:29,250
If you want to gift things to other friends, you can
use the friends' list to find out who your friends are.

173
174
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,250
You can give them things.

174
175
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:35,470
This is outside of the features that we provide you.

175
176
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,240
Cross-session messaging.

176
177
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:45,630
If you have virtual worlds, you have friends, you can
leave messages for other player IDs on your servers.

177
178
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:50,460
When the user starts your game and they log
in, they can have this information to them.

178
179
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,540
You can use a social graph as part of your gameplay.

179
180
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,290
You can have your users visit each other.

180
181
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,950
This doesn't have to happen online.

181
182
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:06,510
And you can use the connections to
enhance the character's virtual abilities.

182
183
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:11,160
[ Pause ]

183
184
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,580
Now I'm going to go into leaderboards.

184
185
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:20,360
A little bit longer than the last
section but still quite easy to do.

185
186
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,790
So there are three classes now that we
need to talk about for leaderboards.

186
187
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:28,020
GKScore is the actual score.

187
188
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:34,550
A GKLeaderboard is a class that you can use
to access the data inside the leaderboard.

188
189
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,260
And there's a GKLeaderboardViewController.

189
190
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:43,310
The view controller is the standard
UI that we provide to you so --

190
191
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:51,560
to make it very easy for you to show leaderboards
inside your game in a few lines of code.

191
192
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:57,160
I'll go through each of the different
things that you can do.

192
193
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,430
First of all, what is a leaderboard?

193
194
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,750
There's a screenshot of a leaderboard.

194
195
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,110
A leaderboard's a list of high scores.

195
196
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:12,930
There's filters -- Mike alluded to those --
friends, all players, different time possibilities.

196
197
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,770
We're also providing categories.

197
198
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,080
Categories are a way to provide multiple leaderboards.

198
199
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,290
This is something that a lot of people had asked for.

199
200
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:26,010
So you can separate your leaderboards
into easy, medium, and hard.

200
201
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,900
You can have different tracks or different levels.

201
202
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:36,910
In addition to that, you can have one global leaderboard,
where any score to any of the categories that you provide,

202
203
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,190
you'll have one leaderboard which shows you overall scores.

203
204
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,760
Steps to using leaderboards.

204
205
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,490
You have to set it up first.

205
206
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,200
So there's a server-side setup component.

206
207
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,660
There's reporting scores.

207
208
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,530
There's showing the scores using the
standard UI, showing the leaderboards.

208
209
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,750
And there's querying leaderboard data.

209
210
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,650
You would want to do this if you
want to build your own custom UI

210
211
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:08,730
so it's a little bit more integrated
into your game and the style.

211
212
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,250
First I'll talk about server-side setup.

212
213
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,700
This is done in iTunes Connect.

213
214
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,440
You need to enable leaderboards for your
game, and then you need to set them up.

214
215
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,170
And a leaderboard consists of a few different
properties that you set in iTunes Connect.

215
216
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:29,720
There's a leaderboard identifier, which is a string.

216
217
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,070
There's a sort order, ascending or descending.

217
218
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,950
And this is the order that shows up in the leaderboard.

218
219
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:43,660
So, if I have a descending, it means that higher scores are
better because, as you go down the list, they get lower.

219
220
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,380
Ascending, the other way around.

220
221
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,490
So if you have a golf game, for
instance, lower scores would be better.

221
222
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,820
And you can localize this in many different languages.

222
223
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,870
There's a format for your score:
integer values or time values,

223
224
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:02,240
how you want to represent the score;
and a suffix in many languages.

224
225
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,160
More languages are better.

225
226
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,470
It helps sell your game.

226
227
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,100
More people are interested.

227
228
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,210
More people will be able to play it.

228
229
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:16,130
This is a screenshot of iTunes Connect.

229
230
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,260
You can see there's a place for a leaderboard ID.

230
231
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,490
This is an ascending one.

231
232
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,890
You can set the sorting.

232
233
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,250
And all the languages are below.

233
234
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:29,040
In this case, it's only in English and
Spanish using integer values for gold coins.

234
235
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,730
But I suggest you use as many languages as you possibly can.

235
236
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:39,510
This will show based upon the locale of the
user who's using the game on their device.

236
237
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,060
[ Pause ]

237
238
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:46,170
I want to talk a little bit about
formatting because it's interesting.

238
239
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:56,370
I have a few different selected formatters here and some
examples, the first one being an integer value, 123,456.

239
240
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,560
It will format it with a comma.

240
241
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:04,580
Depending upon your locale, we have different
formats that you can choose for an integer value.

241
242
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,230
Time values, I've shown two here.

242
243
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,200
The first one is in minutes.

243
244
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:13,690
So the value that you submit would be 792
as an integer, but it's represented --

244
245
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,590
it's interpreted as the number of minutes.

245
246
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:22,090
So, when it's presented, it actually
shows up as 13 hours and 12 minutes.

246
247
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:29,010
Similarly, when you have a second value, you can
choose to have your value represented as seconds.

247
248
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:36,220
So you have here 3,723 seconds, which shows
up as an hour 2 minutes and 3 seconds.

248
249
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:43,550
And money, 1,042 shows up with a
dollar sign and comma, as appropriate.

249
250
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,200
There's about 17 formatters in all.

250
251
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:53,110
You can see these on iTunes Connect
when you choose to do the localization.

251
252
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,990
So reporting a score.

252
253
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,730
It's quite easy.

253
254
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,520
You allocate a GKScore.

254
255
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:08,010
You set a value, you set a category if you're using
multiple leaderboards, and you report the score.

255
256
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:13,320
A note: If you're offline and there's an error in
communicating with the server, it's your responsibility

256
257
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:20,450
to save that score and attempt to report it at a later
time when the network conditions are more favorable.

257
258
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,320
We make it easy for you.

258
259
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,330
I'll show you that when I get to the code.

259
260
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,080
These are the properties of a GKScore.

260
261
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,680
Some of them are read only.

261
262
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,510
They'll be returned to you when
you ask for leaderboard data.

262
263
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,440
A value is the integer value of the score.

263
264
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:42,200
A formatted value is a string formatted by the server based
upon the properties that you've set in iTunes Connect,

264
265
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,060
how that score is interpreted,
and the optional language suffix.

265
266
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,460
Category, if you're using multiple leaderboards.

266
267
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,550
A date, which is the date, the
time that the score was created.

267
268
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,380
The player who actually created that score.

268
269
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,870
And a rank where it fits on the leaderboard.

269
270
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:06,500
This is how you report a score.

270
271
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,010
You start off allocating a player
score -- allocating a GKScore.

271
272
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,770
Here we call it myPlayerScore.

272
273
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,480
We set a value for the score, 12345.

273
274
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:23,120
And we report the score using this
function, reportScoreWithCompletionHandler.

274
275
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:29,790
There's no result returned, just an indication of the error.

275
276
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,270
If there was an error, that would make it easy for you.

276
277
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:35,540
It's an encodable object so you can use NSKeyedArchiver.

277
278
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,790
So, to serialize this, you can store it
offline so that you can try again either

278
279
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:45,670
when the next time your user plays
the game or later in the play session.

279
280
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,280
If there was no error, you're done.

280
281
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,040
The score was submitted successfully.

281
282
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,750
You can see it.

282
283
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:57,720
Which brings me to the next point: How
do you show these to the user, right?

283
284
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,870
You have a list of scores.

284
285
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,440
This is using the leaderboard standard UI.

285
286
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,420
There's a class called GKLeaderboardViewController.

286
287
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,010
It's a modal view controller.

287
288
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,660
There's a button at the top right which says done

288
289
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,320
so that the user can indicate, I'm
finished looking at the leaderboard.

289
290
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,970
And so there's a delegate method
which you have to implement.

290
291
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,980
I'll start off with that.

291
292
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,780
leaderboardDidPressDismiss.

292
293
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:25,200
All we're doing is we're dismissing the modal view
controller, which will take it off the screen.

293
294
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,340
This will appear on top of your view.

294
295
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:33,830
So, to show the leaderboard, we've created
this function called showLeaderboard.

295
296
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:41,150
The first thing it does is it allocates
GKLeaderboardViewController.

296
297
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:44,660
It initializes it with some filters.

297
298
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:49,960
In this case, we're interested in all the
scores over the last week for my friends.

298
299
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,790
And we set the delegate to ourselves so
that we'll know when they're finished,

299
300
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,190
and we present the -- we present the view controller.

300
301
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,770
I think that's fairly simple.

301
302
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:12,540
We also give you the ability if you want to create
your own custom UI to query the leaderboard.

302
303
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:17,150
To do this, you use the GKLeaderboard class.

303
304
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:21,290
You set the scopes similarly to how
we just -- how I just showed you.

304
305
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,920
You set a range of ranks that you're interested in.

305
306
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,900
As Mike said, you don't want to load the whole leaderboard.

306
307
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,280
There might be thousands or millions of entries.

307
308
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,810
It's an asynchronous operation
that communicates with our server.

308
309
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:41,290
It could take a fair amount of time, especially if the
list is really long; and that's a poor user experience.

309
310
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:47,540
Lastly, you can set a category if you're using
multiple leaderboards; and you can query the data.

310
311
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,580
It returns an array of GKScores.

311
312
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,470
We've seen this before.

312
313
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,530
But just to reiterate, these are
the ones that you're interested in.

313
314
00:22:54,530 --> 00:23:02,880
The player who scored that score, you can get their player
ID and their alias; the rank where it fits in the list;

314
315
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:11,990
the value, the formatted value which comes from
the iTunes Connect properties; and the date.

315
316
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:17,040
So here we actually see some code,
how to query the leaderboard.

316
317
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:22,610
So we start off with allocating a GKLeaderboard object.

317
318
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,530
We set the properties that we're
interested in -- again, friends only --

318
319
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,930
and the scope is week, so all the scores over the last week.

319
320
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,880
And I'm just going to take a look
at the top of the leaderboard.

320
321
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,570
I'm using a range here.

321
322
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:41,470
Normally, ranges start with index values;
but leaderboard values start with 1.

322
323
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:46,040
So, in this case, we're looking at
25 values starting at the value 1.

323
324
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,980
So it will show you the top 25 list.

324
325
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:55,100
And then we call loadScoresWithCompletionHandler.

325
326
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:02,260
It returns to you an NSArray of scores,
GKScores, to be precise; and an error.

326
327
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:06,980
Again, we might pass you back some cached
data in the case of a communications error.

327
328
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:11,300
So you should be prepared for both
those values to be returned to you.

328
329
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:17,740
If there's scores using -- in this case, I'm
just doing a fast enumeration across the list,

329
330
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,880
and you'll want to do something with
it to show it in your own custom UI.

330
331
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,750
If there's an error, you might
want to indicate that to the user.

331
332
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:29,170
You might want to try again, depending on what the error is.

332
333
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,830
That's querying a leaderboard.

333
334
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,950
So I have a few screenshots of
what the leaderboard looks like.

334
335
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,240
We provide both landscape and portrait views.

335
336
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,240
So this is what it looks like in landscape.

336
337
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,030
You can see here there's two sections.

337
338
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:50,980
There's a friends section, an all player section, and,
across the top, you have the ability to change the filters.

338
339
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,270
This is would what it would look like in your game.

339
340
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:57,660
If you choose to do a custom UI,
you could do something like this.

340
341
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,750
This is from Onward.

341
342
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,030
It's a game that we've been using inside for testing.

342
343
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,560
And here you can see they've done
something slightly different.

343
344
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:11,100
What they do is they actually show two different time scopes
at once, scores over the last week and all time scores.

344
345
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:16,350
It's chosen not to separate that between friends
but, as a developer, you can do whatever you want.

345
346
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,470
And I'm really interested to see what you do.

346
347
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:24,150
Landscape, it looks slightly different
but pretty much the same.

347
348
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:29,810
You have that two sections, one for friends and
one for all players and the filters across the top.

348
349
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,520
And, likewise, you can easily do custom.

349
350
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,510
This comes from Quest.

350
351
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,780
That's leaderboards.

351
352
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:42,960
I think I'm going a little fast.

352
353
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,330
Here we go.

353
354
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:48,970
We're going to talk about achievements.

354
355
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,070
Achievements, coming soon.

355
356
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,470
Not all of it is available.

356
357
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:55,140
Particularly what's missing is the server-side setup.

357
358
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,410
The APIs are there if you want to test your code.

358
359
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:05,550
There are three classes involved:
GKAchievementDescription is a list

359
360
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:10,480
of all the achievements for your game across all users.

360
361
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:20,340
There's a GKAchievement, which is the list of achievements
recorded by the user, the GKLocalUser in this case.

361
362
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:27,820
And GKAchievementViewController, which is the standard UI.

362
363
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,870
So what is an achievement?

363
364
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:37,470
An achievement is something of significance,
something your player's done inside your game

364
365
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:41,230
that you want to record, maybe reward them for.

365
366
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:47,630
Examples: finishing a level really fast;
finding all the treasure in a dungeon.

366
367
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,490
Come into our labs tomorrow.

367
368
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,730
Please come to our labs tomorrow.

368
369
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:55,080
It increases the engagement.

369
370
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,270
Players will want to come and complete all the achievements.

370
371
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,970
They'll want to get all the achievements
that you have possible.

371
372
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,260
They'll want to finish your game.

372
373
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,620
They want to get to 100 percent complete.

373
374
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,960
It also encourages competition.

374
375
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:13,800
Inside the Game Center application, you've seen you
can compare the achievements between your friends.

375
376
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,050
You want to say to your friends, I got this achievement.

376
377
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,390
You should go get this achievement.

377
378
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,060
Helps engage your game.

378
379
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,340
Helps keep your game last.

379
380
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:29,300
People want to play the game.

380
381
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:33,220
These are the steps involved in using achievements.

381
382
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,390
There's a server-side setup.

382
383
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,800
I'll go over that a little bit.

383
384
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,560
You can report achievements.

384
385
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:45,690
You can access the descriptions for your achievements.

385
386
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:48,640
You can query your achievements for custom UIs.

386
387
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,900
You can show your achievements to your users.

387
388
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,760
There's a standard UI.

388
389
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,280
I'll show you that.

389
390
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,310
And there's the ability for you
to create your own custom UI.

390
391
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:02,410
And, lastly, there's a way to reset the achievements.

391
392
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:06,000
Somebody in the earlier session asked,
"What happens if I add more achievements?"

392
393
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,240
If you add more achievements and somebody's already finished
your game and they want to go back and play it again,

393
394
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,510
this is a perfect opportunity for
them to reset their achievements.

394
395
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:18,400
The server-side setup is done in iTunes Connect.

395
396
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:23,010
You can enable achievements in your game.

396
397
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:26,160
And you describe each of your achievements.

397
398
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,410
This is what you need to do for each achievement.

398
399
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,610
There's an achievement ID.

399
400
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:33,050
It must be unique within your game.

400
401
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:41,080
We suggest using an inverse DNS, something
like com.myCompany.myGame.achievementX.

401
402
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,270
There's a title for the achievement.

402
403
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:49,070
There are two descriptions for the achievement,
one that shows up before the user's achieved it

403
404
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:52,560
and one that shows up after the user's achieved it.

404
405
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,500
There's a point value associated with each achievement.

405
406
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:02,930
There's a hidden flag -- I'll talk
about that in a minute -- and an icon.

406
407
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:11,210
The hidden flag, as mentioned before, will allow
you to set some of your achievements as hidden.

407
408
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:17,530
So they might be secret achievements that you
want your users to discover by playing your game.

408
409
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:23,720
They might be achievements that you don't want them to
see because they haven't bought the rest of your game

409
410
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,750
if you have some in-app purchase which has extra content.

410
411
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:33,710
You can unhide those achievements once
the user has purchased that content.

411
412
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,280
But it's fairly flexible.

412
413
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:43,600
This is what you'll see inside the code, right?

413
414
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:52,530
It's similar to what you put into iTunes Connect, but
it's a list of -- each achievement has a description.

414
415
00:29:52,530 --> 00:30:01,080
And these are the properties that
you'll see from the framework.

415
416
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,170
So there's a unique ID we talked about
is a string, preferably inverse DNS.

416
417
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:12,800
You'll use this to reference your achievements,
either reporting them or visualizing them.

417
418
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,050
There's a title.

418
419
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,350
There's an icon.

419
420
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:18,330
The icon only shows up once the user's achieved it.

420
421
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:20,480
You'll see in this case there's a few different cases,

421
422
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,080
the question mark where he doesn't have
the achievement, a partial achievement.

422
423
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:31,360
There's two descriptions, again, one
which you'll see before you've achieved it

423
424
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,040
and one which you'll see after you've achieved it.

424
425
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:39,510
There's point values associated with each one,
and there's a flag to hide the achievement.

425
426
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:46,080
[ Pause ]

426
427
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:53,960
A GKAchievement, this is the record of the achievements
that are made by the user, the GKLocalPlayer.

427
428
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,620
The unique ID is the same.

428
429
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:07,560
Percentage complete, how far along that achievement has
the user progressed; the hidden flag; a completed flag,

429
430
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:14,290
which is set once the user has completed the
achievement; the date that this record has been reported;

430
431
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:22,120
and the number of points that the
user's been given for this achievement.

431
432
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,250
So first we'll talk about reporting an achievement.

432
433
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:30,300
Similarly to leaderboards, it's very easy to do.

433
434
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:36,510
We use GKAchievement using the
achievement ID to identify it.

434
435
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:40,660
We set a percentComplete and we report it.

435
436
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:46,020
As the developer, you're responsible for
retrying if there's communications failure.

436
437
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:50,820
The object GKAchievement is a codable object.

437
438
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,730
It's quite simple to store for later use.

438
439
00:31:53,730 --> 00:32:01,210
And this is actually how we do it.

439
440
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:05,530
We start allocating a GKAchievement.

440
441
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:09,210
We initialize it with the identifier.

441
442
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:15,690
More explicitly in this case, we see
com.myCompany.myGame.achievementX.

442
443
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,330
We set a percentComplete.

443
444
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:22,030
So I'm 50 percent done; I'm halfway
through this achievement.

444
445
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:26,600
And we report it.

445
446
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,540
Again, this is a block.

446
447
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:35,060
The body of the block, although it looks
like it's linear, it's actually a callback.

447
448
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,400
There's an error if there's an indication of an error.

448
449
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:44,190
If there was an error, in this case, what you
want to do is you want to archive the achievement

449
450
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:48,340
so that you can reuse it and you can try to report it.

450
451
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:56,200
If there was no error, the achievement was submitted
successfully and the hidden flag will be unset.

451
452
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:02,480
If you hide an achievement and the user reports the
achievement, that means they found out about it.

452
453
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,510
And so we unhide it.

453
454
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:12,380
[ Pause ]

454
455
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,100
Achievements Standard UI.

455
456
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,940
This is a GKAchievementViewController.

456
457
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,020
It's a modal view controller.

457
458
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,690
It requires a delegate.

458
459
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:25,050
There's a done button.

459
460
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:30,090
This is what the delegate look
like, achievementsDidPressDismiss.

460
461
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:33,210
In this case, we just dismissed the modal view controller.

461
462
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:44,840
We have a function here called showAchievements.

462
463
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:50,660
So the first thing that we do is we
allocate the GKAchievement controller.

463
464
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:54,880
There's no properties that we need to initialize it with.

464
465
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:02,200
We need to set the delegate to ourself and then we
show the delegate -- we show the modal view controller.

465
466
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,510
It's quite simple.

466
467
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:10,040
[ Pause ]

467
468
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,300
Getting Achievements Descriptions.

468
469
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,190
So now I'll talk a little bit about
achievements and how you would want

469
470
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:22,260
to create your own custom achievements
or custom UI for achievements, rather.

470
471
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:28,370
Achievement descriptions, as I mentioned before, is
basically the list of achievements for your game.

471
472
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:32,040
So, in this case, they're the same
for all the users of the game.

472
473
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:39,880
I want to start off by loading up this achievements
description table so that I can use it later on in my game.

473
474
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,730
It's a dictionary.

474
475
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:45,460
We start off by loading the achievements.

475
476
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:52,720
It's a class method on GKAchievementDescription,
loadAchievementDescriptionsWithCompletionHandler.

476
477
00:34:52,720 --> 00:35:04,490
And it returns to us in the form of a block callback an
array of descriptions and an indication of the error.

477
478
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:10,380
In this case, what we're doing is I'm
just loading up this description table.

478
479
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:15,630
Now, I'm using the IDs as keys into
this dictionary so I can refer to them.

479
480
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:22,260
When I ask for the achievements, you'll see that
the achievements come back with an achievement ID.

480
481
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,710
The achievement ID is the same
ID that we set in iTunes Connect.

481
482
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:30,890
It's the same ID that's used here, so it will
allow me to cross-reference the achievements

482
483
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:34,040
that my user has used with the achievement descriptions.

483
484
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,890
And I can use both the data in the UI that I'm creating.

484
485
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:43,050
If there's an error, you'll want to
indicate this to your user somehow.

485
486
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:48,880
You'll want to try again, something like that.

486
487
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:59,630
Once we have those descriptions in the description table,
then we can actually look at the achievements for that user.

487
488
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:04,030
You'll notice that the first line is the
same first line as was on the last screen.

488
489
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:07,160
In fact, it's just a repeat; but it's the same object.

489
490
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,310
It's a dictionary that I loaded with the descriptions

490
491
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:15,850
so that I can reference that in
the body of the block coming up.

491
492
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:22,220
So here we see we're using now a GKAchievement
as opposed to a GKAchievementDescription,

492
493
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:26,450
because I want to look at the user's achievements.

493
494
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:35,450
So I start off with a loadAchievementsWithCompletionHandler,
and it returns to me a list of achievements and an error.

494
495
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,980
This will happen in the future.

495
496
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,240
It's an asynchronous call.

496
497
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,060
All of the calls we've seen today are asynchronous.

497
498
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:45,480
They all look quite similar.

498
499
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,190
If there are achievements, I'm
going to loop over the achievements.

499
500
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,080
I'm using fast enumeration here.

500
501
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:55,620
You'll see first I pull out the
description from that dictionary.

501
502
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,670
And, then, in this case, I'm just printing out a log.

502
503
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:08,800
What you'll want to do is create a UI object, an entry in
a table view or something like that where I'm using some

503
504
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,380
of the values from both the description and the achievement.

504
505
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:17,990
So here I'd be printing out how many points out of how
many maximum points and I'm printing out the title.

505
506
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,580
There's lots of other properties there.

506
507
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,810
There's a percent complete.

507
508
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:24,740
There's descriptions.

508
509
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:29,510
You might want to hide them yourself
for the ones that are hidden.

509
510
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:32,510
You can do lots of interesting things.

510
511
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:37,230
[ Pause ]

511
512
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:41,450
And, lastly, we get to resetting user achievements.

512
513
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:46,470
Again, I mentioned that you want to give
your users the ability to start over.

513
514
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,420
Maybe they missed something.

514
515
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:54,460
They missed something on level 2 and, in order to get
back to that, they want to reset their achievements.

515
516
00:37:54,460 --> 00:38:01,130
There's a simple method here called
resetAchievementsWithCompletionHandler with a block.

516
517
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:03,170
You see it like this.

517
518
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:12,280
The block returns an error, and an indication
of whether or not the list was actually reset.

518
519
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:17,740
If there was an error, you might want to try
again or indicate to your user in some fashion

519
520
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:22,270
that there was an error, that their
achievements were not actually reset.

520
521
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:27,050
Otherwise, there's nothing for us to do.

521
522
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,740
Thank you.

522
523
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,140
I'm going to show you a few screenshots now.

523
524
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,720
This is the standard UI.

524
525
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,030
You'll notice various different styles.

525
526
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:39,360
There's one at the top which is 70 percent complete.

526
527
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:45,870
There's one in the middle, Sailor's Mark, which
you have not achieved point values for each one.

527
528
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:51,040
And also we can see what it might look like inside a game.

528
529
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,480
This comes from Quest.

529
530
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,490
They've done a pretty job.

530
531
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:58,640
You'll see the Demon Slayer one,
which is partially achieved.

531
532
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:06,410
You'll see what they did with the
hidden one is they marked it as secret.

532
533
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:10,480
So, in summary, what we talked about, blocks.

533
534
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:16,620
Blocks are an important part of
GameKit, Game Center's framework.

534
535
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:24,590
Most of the calls that you've seen are asynchronous, which
means you make the call so you ask for a leaderboard.

535
536
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:31,590
You say get leaderboards with -- leader scores with
completion handler and your block is run asynchronously.

536
537
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:37,650
So we'll communicate with the server and we'll
report back to you when we have that data.

537
538
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:41,850
So it may happen at any time, and
you need to be aware of this.

538
539
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:44,910
Authentication is really important.

539
540
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:53,380
All the other features rely on your user being
authenticated, so you should do this early in your game.

540
541
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:59,290
However, your game should continue if the user has
chosen not to authenticate or can't authenticate.

541
542
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:04,230
You just won't be able to use any
of the Game Center features.

542
543
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,770
We've seen how to report a high score.

543
544
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:14,850
We've seen how to access the leaderboard data, either
in the form of a standard UI or the data itself

544
545
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:18,400
so that you can create your own custom UI.

545
546
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,960
We've seen, similarly, for achievements, a
little bit more detailed in achievements.

546
547
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:30,050
But we've seen how to record achievements; we've seen
how you can use the standard UI for achievements;

547
548
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:32,650
how you can access the data from the achievements

548
549
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:37,650
so you can create your own standard UIs;
and, lastly, how to reset achievements.

549
550
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,450
A note about achievements.

550
551
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:45,390
I mentioned previously, the API is in the developer
seats, but you won't actually have the ability to set

551
552
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:51,850
up your achievement lists until later this year
when they add that functionality to iTunes Connect.

552
553
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,410
I'm sorry I didn't take more time.

553
554
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:58,940
But if you want more information, Allan is available.

554
555
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,220
Here's his email address.

555
556
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:08,840
There's lots more documentation both on blocks
and on Game Center at the iPhone Dev Center.
