00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,610
>> Michael Creasy: Hi, everyone and welcome.

1
2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:15,310
I'm Michael, here to talk today about Automated
User Interface Testing with Instruments,

2
3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,960
or as I like to call it, "How to find bugs while you sleep."

3
4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,330
Now, I know a lot of you are developers, and
you're building these great applications,

4
5
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,290
and maybe you don't have a dedicated QA person.

5
6
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:33,050
You're trying to split your time between testing your
application, actually developing your application,

6
7
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,930
and testing the new features that you're implementing.

7
8
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:41,240
So what I'm going to show you today is how you can turn
a little bit of your time automating some of your tests

8
9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,130
and then get right back to developing
those great new features.

9
10
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,850
Now, maybe you do have a dedicated QA
person, or maybe you are that QA person.

10
11
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:55,680
Well, I'm going to show you how you can automate your tests,
kind of automate those tests that you do maybe every day,

11
12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,440
on every build, that kind of mundane stuff
that you have to go through all the time,

12
13
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:06,500
and then you can spend your time hunting down those
edge cases and those more interesting scenarios.

13
14
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,030
So let's get started.

14
15
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,160
What am I going to talk about today?

15
16
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,400
Well, first of all, why you should create automated tests.

16
17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,380
And we'll talk about what is UI Automation?

17
18
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,290
What is it that we have for you today?

18
19
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:23,960
We're going to talk about how to automate an application;
we are going through step by step by step how to build

19
20
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:29,420
up a test case, how to actually create
your first automated script; and, lastly,

20
21
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,520
I'm going to cover some of the more advanced topics.

21
22
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,540
These are the more interesting things
that you can do with UI Automation.

22
23
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,900
So why should you create automated tests?

23
24
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,130
Well, you can find bugs while you sleep.

24
25
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:49,460
One of the great things about automation is the system
can be testing your application while you're doing

25
26
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,660
something else.

26
27
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:55,680
You can be getting back to doing developing, writing
those great new features for your application.

27
28
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,910
You can be, maybe you're doing some other manual testing;

28
29
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:03,940
digging in deeper into your application
while the automation is running for you.

29
30
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,520
You can create repeatable regression tests.

30
31
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,330
So let's say you find a bug in your application,
you write a script that covers that scenario,

31
32
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,860
and then from that point on, you never
need to worry about that bug coming back.

32
33
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,190
You never need to be concerned that you've got to
keep testing that because you've got a script now.

33
34
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,990
That script is going to find that bug should it ever
come back; something you never need to worry about again.

34
35
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,990
You can quickly turn around updates to your application.

35
36
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,570
Now, users love getting updates to their application.

36
37
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,390
Personally, I check the App Store every day
just to see what new updates I have available.

37
38
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:46,840
The trouble with pushing out an update for your
application is that you have to test everything again

38
39
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,770
because you don't want to introduce a new regression
or a new bug that your user's going to run into.

39
40
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,780
So you want to make sure that you've maintained or
exceeded that level of quality that you had previously.

40
41
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:02,240
So the great thing with automation is that if you have
a suite of automated tests, you can run through those

41
42
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,380
with your new update, and you instantly know
if you've maintained that level of quality.

42
43
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,370
So what is UI Automation?

43
44
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,380
Well, User Interface Automation for the iPhone.

44
45
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,550
Internally at Apple, we've been
using UI Automation for a long time.

45
46
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,640
This is how we do a lot of our testing.

46
47
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,000
We're working through the User
Interface in our applications,

47
48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,770
we're making sure that what the user
sees is what we want them to see.

48
49
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,650
So we automate UIKit based applications.

49
50
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,510
Now many of you are familiar with UIKit,
you're using it to build your applications,

50
51
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,430
and so really you don't need to
do any more work for automation.

51
52
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,230
It's just going to better work through your application.

52
53
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,400
Fully touch based.

53
54
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,510
Anything a user can do with a finger
on a device, maybe Tap, Scroll,

54
55
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,430
that kind of thing, you can automate through UI Automation.

55
56
00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:03,190
Support the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPhone Simulator
-- one script runs in all three exactly the same.

56
57
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:09,340
So this is any device that runs
iOS 4.0 and supports multitasking,

57
58
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:15,250
will run with UI Automation; one
script exactly the same each time.

58
59
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,230
It's integrated into Instruments.

59
60
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,290
So Instruments is an amazing tool.

60
61
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,000
Maybe you've already been to some of
the sessions on Instruments this week.

61
62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,320
So with Instruments you can monitor kind of your
performance of your application, memory usage.

62
63
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,720
And so we've added in the ability
to automate your application.

63
64
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,780
And what this means is that you can use the
Automation Instrument alongside other instruments

64
65
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,000
and see exactly what is happening in your application.

65
66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,400
So maybe you've been trying to track down a memory leak,

66
67
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,820
maybe you've had other performance
issues with your application.

67
68
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:51,160
You can now write an automated script that runs
through your application with those other instruments,

68
69
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:59,770
and you can pinpoint exactly what was going on when
you saw, maybe, a memory spike or some other issue.

69
70
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,850
Fully accessibility based.

70
71
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,260
Now, there's one key thing with accessibility that's going

71
72
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,200
to make automating your application
easier, and that's up here.

72
73
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,320
The Accessibility Label.

73
74
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,840
You set this in Interface Builder, you put a name
in for your controls that you're building up,

74
75
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,350
that is going to make your life when
it comes to automation so much easier.

75
76
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:25,840
It's not required, but it's going to make life
easier because it will enable you to know exactly

76
77
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,630
which control you're using when
you're automating your application.

77
78
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,730
And we'll show an example of this a little later.

78
79
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,500
So we use JavaScript to automate.

79
80
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,980
And you're probably thinking, "Michael, why
are you using JavaScript for automation?"

80
81
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,510
Well, there's a couple of reasons.

81
82
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:47,190
Automation has always traditionally
been used with a scripting language.

82
83
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:53,030
And so the reason behind this is that scripting
language is very easy for anyone to pick up.

83
84
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:59,210
There's a lot of very talented QA engineers out there
that maybe don't have any programming experience

84
85
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:04,080
that you developers have, and so something like
JavaScript is very easy for them to pick up and learn,

85
86
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:11,520
yet it also has the flexibility and complexity
for you developers to do more complex things,

86
87
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,510
and we'll cover some of those a little later.

87
88
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,930
And lastly, with the JavaScript, it
runs outside of your application.

88
89
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,930
So the application that you're testing

89
90
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,900
through your automation is exactly the
same as what you'll submit to the store.

90
91
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:33,020
You're not adding anything to your application in order to
do the testing, so it's exactly the same code each time.

91
92
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,670
So with that, I'm going to hand it over to Matt who's going
to show us a quick demo of what UI Automation looks like.

92
93
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,400
>> Matt Dreisbach: So let's see
how this looks like on a device.

93
94
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:47,210
What we've got here is a piece of sample code
it's available on the Developer's Site UI Catalog.

94
95
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,600
We've gone ahead and written the script.

95
96
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,510
You can see that we can identify buttons,
navigate the navigation bar, click on things.

96
97
00:06:54,510 --> 00:07:01,310
[ Running script ]

97
98
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,390
We can interact with text fields.

98
99
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:13,230
So we're going to go ahead and set -- cap the
field to make it First Responder and set the text.

99
100
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:22,950
We can simulate various gestures
such as Inch Open and Drags.

100
101
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,900
Notice I'm not interacting with the device.

101
102
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,610
Easy to do double taps.

102
103
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:34,160
You can set the orientation, in case your app happens
to run in landscape, you can do some testing there.

103
104
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,000
Show you a few more examples of it interacting with some
controls, and then I'll show you exactly how you set one

104
105
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,620
of these up in Instruments to run your script.

105
106
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,050
Interacting with Switches here, Sliders.

106
107
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:50,420
You can also simulate a Lock, and you can
also do Backgrounding and Foregrounding

107
108
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,510
of your app, so you can test the Multitask interface.

108
109
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,790
Okay. So how did I run that script?

109
110
00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:01,250
Let's go look at the desktop machine here, and
I'm going to bring up a new Instrument session.

110
111
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,910
You notice when you first launch Instruments, you'll
be prevented -- presented with this template chooser.

111
112
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:11,680
Under the iPhone templates here, you'll
want to select the Automation template.

112
113
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,050
Then you need to make sure you're targeting your iPhone.

113
114
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:27,060
So up here in the target chooser, select iPhone, and
select your -- the application that you want to target.

114
115
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,830
And then down here on the left there's a Choose Script.

115
116
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:39,900
You just need to navigate to your script,
and then start the Tracing session

116
117
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,150
which will automatically start up the script.

117
118
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:51,370
So you'll see as you run the automation, you can log the
beginning of tests, and they show up in this Outline view.

118
119
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,030
You can expand that and see more detailed logging inside.

119
120
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:58,200
We also have the ability to capture screenshots,
so if there's something you're interested

120
121
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,550
in onscreen while you're running your test, you see
it over here on the right in the Extended Detail,

121
122
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,280
it will display the screenshot that you took.

122
123
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,080
And up at the top here in the timeline, we
highlight green when you passed this test.

123
124
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,030
If you were to fail a test, we'll highlight that red.

124
125
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:16,750
So I'm going to hand this back to Michael, and he's going
to tell you a little bit about how you write this script.

125
126
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,660
>> Michael Creasy: So now you've seen kind of
an example script and how you can use that.

126
127
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,440
So let's look at how we can actually
automate an application.

127
128
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,610
First thing I need to talk about is Elements.

128
129
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:34,020
So every control in your application
gets represented to UI Automation

129
130
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,330
as an element, Now the base element is UIAElement.

130
131
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,650
This is from what all other elements are inherited from.

131
132
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:46,390
And there's a couple of properties on that
that are really important to understand.

132
133
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:50,890
There's a lot more than this, but these are
the four that I really want to focus on today.

133
134
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,000
First up, Name.

134
135
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,620
Now the name is what was set -- if you
remember, we talked about accessibility,

135
136
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,660
the Accessibility Label gets translated
into the name of your element.

136
137
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:07,730
And this is what makes it very easy for you to
find individual controls in your application.

137
138
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,010
The Value.

138
139
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,310
As you'd expect, this is the value of a control.

139
140
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:18,510
Say you had a text field, for example, any text that
appeared in that field gets represented as the value.

140
141
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:25,930
So you can very easily read maybe some text out
of your application for verification purposes.

141
142
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:31,900
Elements. Well, you think of your
application as having a hierarchy of controls.

142
143
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:38,830
This gets represented as individual elements, so
every element can contain zero or more other elements.

143
144
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:44,990
Think, for example, a table here may have
multiple cells as its child elements,

144
145
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,490
and equally parent within one level back up.

145
146
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:51,970
So let's look at the control hierarchy a little bit more.

146
147
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:59,080
Here we have the rest of his sample from Developer website,
and we're going to dig through this and see how we build

147
148
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:04,210
up a line of code to access a particular
element in your application.

148
149
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,240
So let's start off with the target application.

149
150
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,280
This is the application that -- your
application that you're testing.

150
151
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:17,420
And we access that through UIATarget,
localTarget, and the frontMost application.

151
152
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,270
From there we move down to the
mainWindow, which looks identical, it is,

152
153
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,170
after all, the main window of the application.

153
154
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,550
Move down from the mainWindow, we get to an individual view.

154
155
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,180
In this case we have a tableView.

155
156
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,570
Moving down from the tableView,
we get down to an individual cell.

156
157
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,290
And you'll see how I've accessed
this, we have an array of table views,

157
158
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,000
we just chose the first one, so the Zero Table view.

158
159
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,950
And again I've chosen the first
cell which is highlighted here.

159
160
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:52,420
Beyond the individual element, you get a child element,
in this case, we're directly accessing "chocolate cake."

160
161
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,860
So how do you go from that to actually
building up a test case?

161
162
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,330
Well, let's start with something really simple.

162
163
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,680
I'm going to start by tapping a button.

163
164
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,170
Nearly every application uses a button at some point, you're
going to want to tap one at some point during your testing.

164
165
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,300
So we got a little code snippet up
here that shows you how it's done.

165
166
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:15,890
But what I want you to pay attention to
is when I've worked through the hierarchy

166
167
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:20,190
of the navigation bar, individual
buttons, into the add button.

167
168
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:24,310
And so that's actually the plus button that
you see at the top of the navigation bar,

168
169
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:29,440
and the reason we can access it using the word
"add" is because that's the Accessibility Label

169
170
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,070
that we've set on that individual button.

170
171
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:36,490
So we've made it easy for ourselves to go and be
able to find that rather than having to see, oh,

171
172
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,390
the zero button or the first button, you know.

172
173
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:44,330
Accessing it by name makes not only a more readable script,
but it makes it much easier for you to write your script.

173
174
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,770
So let's go ahead and tap that and see what happens.

174
175
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,720
Well, we've moved to another screen.

175
176
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,450
It looks like that worked.

176
177
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,640
So what are we going to do next?

177
178
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,990
Well, we've got a text input there, you
probably want to type something into it.

178
179
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,970
We start off by declaring a local variable,
in this case a bit of text with "Turtle Pie."

179
180
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,390
It's a favorite recipe of Matt's, and he's
promised to bring some into the office next week.

180
181
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:13,660
So how do I get that text into that text field?

181
182
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,630
Well, again, I work my way through the
control hierarchy to the first text field.

182
183
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,000
There's only one there, so I don't
really necessary access it by name.

183
184
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,560
I can just go for the first one in
our array and course setValue on it,

184
185
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,190
and that's going to insert the text
directly into -- into the display.

185
186
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,730
So let's take a look at that.

186
187
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,170
Sure enough we've managed to insert Turtle Pie.

187
188
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,660
Tabs are great in your application.

188
189
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,210
It lets you display a lot more information
users can navigate back and forth between.

189
190
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:49,050
But how do you access individual tabs?

190
191
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,040
How do you move between them in your application?

191
192
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,400
Well, it turns out it's a lot like tapping a button.

192
193
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,640
Let's have a look at this little code
snippet here and see how it's done.

193
194
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:03,910
First of all, I'm declaring a local variable to access the
tabBar directly so I don't have to write that huge long line

194
195
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,380
of text every single time, I can
just narrow it down to one element.

195
196
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:13,120
Once I've got my tabBar, I want
to know which tab is selected.

196
197
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,340
So I'm accessing the tabBar, asking for the
selected button, and getting the name of it.

197
198
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,450
Then I'm checking to see what tab is selected.

198
199
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:30,080
Now, is it the Unit Conversion tab, and if it's not,
we just tap that button, and let's see what happens.

199
200
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,520
Well, we moved to the next tab as we expected.

200
201
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,440
So let's move on in building up our test.

201
202
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,590
Scrolling.

202
203
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,960
You got a table in your application,
you're already used to scrolling up

203
204
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,840
and down to find individual elements,
so let's see how we to that.

204
205
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:54,580
First of all, again, accessing localTarget, frontMost
application, my mainWindow, and the individual table,

205
206
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,350
and now I want to scroll to that
Turtle Pie recipe we've added.

206
207
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:03,240
So I'm using the function called
scrollToElementWithPredicate, and what this enables you

207
208
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,490
to do is scroll to an element that maybe
you don't know the complete name of.

208
209
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:14,340
This will come in handy if maybe you have some
unexpected text, maybe some text that's come

209
210
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,660
from the Internet, maybe a date or a time.

210
211
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,100
Something that you can't predict at
the time you're writing your script.

211
212
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,900
In this case, we could predict it,
but let's have a look at how it works.

212
213
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:30,750
So I create a predicate, namebeginswith
"Turtle Pie," and that enables me to access

213
214
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,700
that cell directly and scroll down to it.

214
215
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:38,400
So once you've worked through your application, it's great
that you can tap individual elements, you can find stuff,

215
216
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,200
you can scroll, but that doesn't make a great test case.

216
217
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,660
For a test to actually work, you
need some sort of verification.

217
218
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,300
You need to actually verify that you've done
something and that a test has passed or failed.

218
219
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,600
So let's look at how we'd verify that
we've added Turtle Pie to our recipe.

219
220
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,650
This big chunk of code here.

220
221
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,730
Again, what I want to do is access
the cell that contains Turtle Pie

221
222
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:09,140
and determine if it's -- that -- if it's there or not.

222
223
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:15,370
So first of all, I create a local reference
to that cell, and I'm using this case,

223
224
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:18,640
firstWithPredicate, and namebeginswith "Turtle Pie" as well.

224
225
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,580
That will give me a reference to that cell.

225
226
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,470
I then check if the cell is valid or not valid.

226
227
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:30,410
And if it is valid, I go ahead and log a pass for
my test; and if it isn't, then I go and log a fail.

227
228
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:36,240
And what cell.isValid is actually doing is
checking to see if that cell exists or not.

228
229
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,010
How do you go about logging information?

229
230
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:43,450
Now, when you're writing your tests, you need to log as
much information as you can because this is what's going

230
231
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,370
to make it easy for you to diagnose any failures that occur.

231
232
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:53,060
One of the most important things you need to log is
when you start your test and when you end your test.

232
233
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,050
And we've made this really simple.

233
234
00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:02,120
All you need to do is call UIALogger, logStart
and the name of your test, write your test,

234
235
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,480
and then ultimately at the end call
logPass, assuming your test is passing;

235
236
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,470
otherwise logFail for a test that's failing.

236
237
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:17,100
So it's very easy just to mark off in your code
exactly when a test is starting and when it ends.

237
238
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,010
Of course, that's not everything.

238
239
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:22,810
You really need to log as much as you can
about what's going in your application.

239
240
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:28,130
What we recommend is every time you interact
with a control, log what you've done.

240
241
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:33,460
That way when you go back to look at the log of your
test, maybe when it fails, you can read through your log

241
242
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,620
and see exactly the steps that have occurred.

242
243
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,390
And that'll make it much easier to
diagnose any failures that have happened.

243
244
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:46,200
But logging is as simple as just
calling logMessage and a text string.

244
245
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:52,970
But they say a picture is worth a thousand words,
and sometimes text is just not going to be enough.

245
246
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,670
So you can go ahead and log a screenshot.

246
247
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:59,590
And, in fact, that's how we've captured all
of the screenshots in this presentation.

247
248
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:05,490
All of the screenshots we've used were captured
through UI Automation using code just like this.

248
249
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:10,000
So you go ahead and call captureScreenshot,
give it a name of the screenshot,

249
250
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,540
and this gets saved back in Instruments as the file name.

250
251
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:21,880
So, you know, a little more useful name than Screenshot 1 is
probably a good idea; otherwise, you're never really going

251
252
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,910
to know what your screenshots are until you look at them.

252
253
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:28,260
This will make it easier for you to find them, do any
post processing that you need to do, after the fact.

253
254
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,550
So with that, we're going to hand it back over to Matt,

254
255
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:37,080
who's going to show you how the script
we've just written works in practice.

255
256
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,440
>> Matt Dreisbach: So we've gone
ahead and written this recipe script.

256
257
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:51,820
You can see, just as Michael showed you, clicks the
add button in the navigation bar and sets the text.

257
258
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:57,830
We've added some other tests that enter the description
information and the prep time of this recipe,

258
259
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:03,510
adding some ingredients, just give you more
examples of the type of testing you can do.

259
260
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:30,410
[ Running test ]

260
261
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:37,960
So this test is coming along well,
but you'll notice that we're --

261
262
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,930
left with the recipe of the night and it
might be nice to implement a Delete test.

262
263
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:47,340
So I'm going to go ahead and walk
through implementing this Delete test.

263
264
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,870
In order to delete this item, the
first thing you're going to need

264
265
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,440
to do is select the Edit button from the navigation bar.

265
266
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,920
So we're going to have to isolate that, click that button.

266
267
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:06,770
Then we're going to choose the switch to enter the Delete
mode and then click the Confirmation Delete button.

267
268
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:14,120
I want to exit Edit Mode again by tapping on that done
button in the navigation bar, and then, once again,

268
269
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,050
this time we'll want to verify
that the recipe's been removed.

269
270
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,820
So here's the last run we had on this test.

270
271
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,820
You'll notice there's this Edit button next to the script.

271
272
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,100
If you click that, that will go
ahead and bring up that JavaScript

272
273
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,220
in the editor that you have selected for JavaScript.

273
274
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,380
In this case, we've -- we have Xcode set.

274
275
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:38,140
And I'll just run you through this script quickly here.

275
276
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:45,880
We've gone ahead and saved a reference to the local
target here in this variable target, and the frontMost app

276
277
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,130
and this Variable app, and then we've implemented a
few convenience functions here that help us get back

277
278
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,390
to the main list view because we know
we're going to be doing that a lot.

278
279
00:20:55,390 --> 00:21:00,750
Let's see, just finds different tab bar
and navigation bars and it goes ahead

279
280
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,730
and selects those to make sure we're on the right mode.

280
281
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:09,180
And you'll see at the bottom here, we're
calling the various tests we've implemented --

281
282
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,950
this is fairly simple script, you may
want to add more complexity to yours,

282
283
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,300
but I wanted to give you a simple example.

283
284
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,990
And here's the Add Recipe test
that Michael's been working on.

284
285
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:22,830
So let's go ahead and add that Delete Recipe test.

285
286
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:28,800
We're going to start out by just sort of framing
this function here, function Delete Recipe.

286
287
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:34,790
It's going to take one argument, the name of the
recipe, and we're going to log the start of the test.

287
288
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:42,180
And we're going to call this Return to Recipes
continue function to get back to the list.

288
289
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:48,020
And then, if you recall, the first thing we
want to do is isolate that navigation bar

289
290
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,530
and the -- the Edit button and the navigation bar.

290
291
00:21:51,530 --> 00:22:05,060
We're going to log what we're doing, and on the app Object,
find the navigation bar, get the list of button elements,

291
292
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:10,560
and select the Edit button, and click Tap.

292
293
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,390
Now one of the things you'll notice with the
automation is that we will patiently wait

293
294
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,820
up to a certain timeout for elements to come on screen.

294
295
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:26,010
One of the things that happens often in automation is
that the thing that you're trying to target won't be --

295
296
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:30,850
there'll be animations that won't be on screen right away,
so in this case, we're actually getting the right button,

296
297
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,990
and we're making sure its name has
changed to Done before moving on.

297
298
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:39,480
So now that we know we're in Edit mode,
we're going to go ahead and scroll

298
299
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,290
to the element using that scrollToElementWithPredicate.

299
300
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:49,430
In this case, when we're in Edit mode, the
name of that cell will be prefixWithDelete,

300
301
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:53,730
so we're constructing this string
Delete and the recipe name.

301
302
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:02,330
We've saved a reference to that cell, and now we're
going to look inside that cell for all of its switches.

302
303
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,080
There'll only be one switch.

303
304
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,300
We're going to get the first switch
and set its value to one.

304
305
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:18,450
Added some delays in here to make this
run slower so you can see what's going on.

305
306
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:24,460
Next, we look in that same cell, and we
look for the Confirm Deletion button.

306
307
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:30,470
So we're using Predicate again, nameBeginsWith
"Confirm Deletion," and we're tapping that element.

307
308
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:39,680
Then we want to exit the Edit mode by
selecting the done button in the navigation bar.

308
309
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:51,520
And we'll search the table to make sure
that that element has been removed.

309
310
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:59,100
And we're going to take a screenshot there to make sure
that it's gone so we can confirm later if we need to.

310
311
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:11,400
And then, finally, all we need to do is call
our new delete function here at the end.

311
312
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,820
Okay. So let's return to Instruments and let's see that run.

just hit Record again, it will pick up the changes.

315

See how easy it is, once you have these tests
to just iterate them over and over again.

316
317
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:52,120
If you write them flexible enough, you can add several
recipes to your, you know, app, and stress test your app.

317

dandy to know we have a test that passes.

322

But what's really valuable is to
know if we can catch a failure.

323
324
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:40,630

your tests to test that failure case.

things you can do with the automation.

not only, you know, show that your test's a pass,

340
341
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:36,120
but we can also catch a failure as well, so you
know when something has failed in your application.

341
342
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,840
So now I'm going to cover some of the more advanced topics,

342
343
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,500
some of the more interesting things
that you can do with UI Automation.

343
344
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,030
So we'll start off with handling unexpected alerts.

344
345
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:54,600
One of the traditional problems that
User Interface Automation has had is what

345
346
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,880
to do when something unexpected happens.

346
347
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,540
When something like this pops up on screen,
I mean, you are testing on a phone after all,

347
348
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,620
what happens if you get a text message
in the middle of your automation run?

348
349
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:10,030
Well, traditionally, everything
would now fail at this point.

349
350
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:15,040
Your world, as far as the application is concerned,
has changed; something has appeared on screen;

350
351
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,190
your script wasn't expecting this to happen;

351
352
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:21,820
it can't find the controls it's looking
for; and everything just falls apart.

352
353
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,330
And you end up looking at a whole load of failures,

353
354
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:31,010
and you find out that Johnny sent you a text
message and destroyed your automation run.

354
355
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,830
So let's fix that.

355
356
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,950
We can automatically dismiss these alerts.

356
357
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,410
Let's have a look at how we do that.

357
358
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:41,930
Well, create a function called onAlert.

358
359
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:44,730
This is our Alert Handler function.

359
360
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:51,750
And all I've done in this function is just log a
message, just logging the fact that this alert happened.

360
361
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,730
And then I return false.

361
362
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:58,090
And what false is telling the system
is that I, as a script writer,

362
363
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:02,380
have not handled this alert, and I
want you to get rid of it for me.

363
364
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:08,680
And so what UI Automation is going to do is
click that Close button, get rid of the alert,

364
365
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,210
and your script continues running
exactly where you left off.

365
366
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,900
So whatever action you were doing previously,
you go right back to where you were,

366
367
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:20,590
and your script carries on as if nothing had ever happened.

367
368
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,650
Now occasionally, of course, you're
going to get expected alerts.

368
369
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:28,240
You're going to get stuff pop up that
is that is part of your application.

369
370
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:34,010
Now, maybe, as in this case, you've
got a confirmation dialog.

370
371
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:38,760
Now obviously you don't want to dismiss this alert
automatically because this is part of your application,

371
372
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:43,270
and you want to be able to deal with
this appropriately when the time comes.

372
373
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,860
So let's have a look at our Alert Handler again.

373
374
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:51,530
If we just run it as it is, we'd go ahead
and probably click that Rename button,

374
375
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:55,640
that is the default button, and
that's not what you want to happen.

375
376
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,820
So how do I deal with that?

376
377
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:04,450
Well, I have this little code snippet here, that looks
for this precise dialog box that's going to pop up,

377
378
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:10,610
and when we find it, we're going to tap the Continue
button instead of the Rename button and return true.

378
379
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:19,000
And that way we're by-passing the Default Handler,
which means that UI Automation is not going to deal

379
380
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,450
with this alert, you've told the system,
you know, "I've dealt with this alert.

380
381
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,200
Don't handle it.

381
382
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:25,870
It's all dealt with.

382
383
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,090
It's all fine."

383
384
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:32,550
And at this point, your script goes back
exactly where it was and continues running.

384
385
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:38,510
So you don't have to sort of try and write extra code
all over the place to deal with alerts as they happen,

385
386
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:42,260
you just have one function that deals
with them no matter when they occur.

386
387
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,490
And Multitasking.

387
388
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:48,910
Huge new feature in iOS 4.0.

388
389
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:52,900
Something we're very excited about,
and everyone else is excited about it.

389
390
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:59,290
You've probably already started implementing Multitasking
in your application, and you want to be able to test that.

390
391
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:06,750
So we try to make it as easy as possible to test
Multitasking, and there's only one line of code you need

391
392
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:10,130
to do to test Multitasking in your application.

392
393
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:16,620
As you know, when a user exits your application by tapping
the Home button or causing some other application to come

393
394
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:20,260
to the foreground, your application gets suspended.

394
395
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:26,840
So we've simulated this entire work
flow just in this one line of code.

395
396
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,650
We code deactivateAppForDuration, give
it a time, in this case ten seconds,

396
397
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:36,890
and what that's going to do is simulate a
user tapping the Home button on your device,

397
398
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:42,010
your application will get suspended, ten
seconds later your application will resume,

398
399
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:47,040
it will come back to the foreground exactly
the same way that a user would do it,

399
400
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:52,920
as if they'd brought up the app switch, or tapped
your app's icon, brought it back to the foreground.

400
401
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,570
And your script just continues running.

401
402
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,830
You don't have to do anything else.

402
403
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:01,930
That one line will simulate suspending
your application and resuming it.

403
404
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:05,220
It's that easy to implement and test Multitasking.

404
405
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:10,550
So how do you deal with Orientation?

405
406
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:15,840
All right, you've got your devices hooked
up to your desk, it's running with your Mac,

406
407
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,440
and you can tap on various things,
but how do you simulate Orientation?

407
408
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,270
We've not gone and built a robot
that will rotate a device for you.

408
409
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:30,520
That would have been awesome, but we
kind of had to do it in software instead.

409
410
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,800
So how do we go about doing that?

410
411
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:36,170
Well, again, really, really simple.

411
412
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,840
Just simulating that Device Orientation.

412
413
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:44,680
And to do that we setDeviceOrientation
with one of the constants that are defined,

413
414
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:48,390
in this case Device_Orientation_Landscapeleft.

414
415
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:51,380
This is what's going to rotate the device.

415
416
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,570
That just simulates the rotation that's occurred.

416
417
00:33:54,570 --> 00:34:01,670
Now if you deal with raw accelerometer data in your
application, this is not actually going to do what you want.

417
418
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:05,140
This is just purely simulating that a rotation has occurred.

418
419
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:12,200
So if you're using a UI device just to get notified when
a rotation has occurred, this will do that work for you.

419
420
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:18,520
Of course, once you've rotated,
you do need to rotate back again.

420
421
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:27,700
And what I recommend is if you're doing a test that
involves changing the orientation of your device,

421
422
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:34,130
that you set your rotation at the beginning of your test,
and then set it back at the end of your test to Portrait.

422
423
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:40,800
That way, no matter what happens, your next test
that runs, it's always back in a known, good state,

423
424
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,340
and you don't risk getting confused about not being in
the right orientation for whatever tests are carrying on.

424
425
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:52,860
So let's talk about some of the advanced
touch interactions that you can do.

425
426
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:58,810
What you've seen so far is how we can tap into
individual controls and elements in a very simple fashion.

426
427
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:03,050
But that might not be enough for your application.

427
428
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,380
So there's a few things that I want to cover.

428
429
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:11,320
We'll cover how you can do more advanced
Taps, some Pinches, and Drags and Flicks.

429
430
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,730
So let's have a look at, first of all, Taps.

430
431
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:20,880
So you see from this first line of code, I'm just
tapping at an arbitrary location on the screen.

431
432
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,230
So I've set x and y coordinates, and that
simulates a tap happening at that location.

432
433
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:30,760
Doesn't matter what's at that location,
it's just going to tap right there.

433
434
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,320
Double Tap is exactly the same.

434
435
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,310
And also a two finger tap.

435
436
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:45,510
So think how, like in Maps, do a two finger tap to zoom
out, and this is how you do that in a simulated environment.

436
437
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:52,570
Pinches. So you can Pinch Open and Pinch Close,
maybe to zoom in, zoom out, that kind of thing.

437
438
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:55,940
And this is little bit more complex.

438
439
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:00,280
Code pinchOpenFromToForDuration.

439
440
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:05,830
And so again this is coordinates that's
starting and ending the pinch and the duration,

440
441
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,680
this is the time in seconds for that action to occur.

441
442
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,550
So in this case, we're doing two seconds.

442
443
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:18,030
Well, what that means is, for your application you
may want to simulate a very slow pinch or a very fast.

443
444
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:22,490
You have some flexibility in the
timing of that action happening.

444
445
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:28,370
Equally, Pinch Close does the exact opposite, zooming in.

445
446
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:31,490
So Drag and Flick.

446
447
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:35,730
Maybe you just need to scroll through a table
really quickly, maybe you've got other elements

447
448
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,720
that you just need to move around on screen.

448
449
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:47,420
Call dragFromToForDuration, and this is our
starting location, our ending location, and a time.

449
450
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:55,560
So in this case, this is going to drag from 160 by
200, to 160 by 400, over a period of one second.

450
451
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,920
Again, you have the flexibility of specifying a time.

451
452
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:05,300
Whether you want it to happen very quickly or very slowly,
completely up to you and what your application needs to do.

452
453
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,900
flickFromTo is a little bit different.

453
454
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,680
A Flick is, by definition, a fast action.

454
455
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,600
So there is no time on this because
it has to happen quickly.

455
456
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,630
But otherwise, code in much the same fashion.

456
457
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:25,420
Timeout. As you see when Matt built up his script,

457
458
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,520
occasionally you need to wait for
an element to appear on screen.

458
459
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:34,600
Maybe you've got some great animation or transition that is
occurring in your application after you click the button,

459
460
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:41,210
and you want to wait for that to happen before
you start interacting with another control.

460
461
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:45,880
So you want to wait for an element to appear
on screen before you interact with it.

461
462
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,430
How do we do that?

462
463
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:51,840
Well, just try and access the element directly.

463
464
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:59,560
And what this will do is keep trying to
access that for a given amount of time.

464
465
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:06,600
Once it finds that element, that line of code returns, and
you can carry on doing whatever you need to do with it.

465
466
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,610
By default will wait up to five seconds.

466
467
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:14,120
If that element doesn't appear within that
five second period, it will get an exception

467
468
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:18,590
because clearly something has happened
in your application that wasn't expected,

468
469
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:21,300
and you need to deal with that in some other way.

469
470
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,790
But maybe five seconds is too long or too short.

470
471
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:31,250
Maybe you've got this fantastic animation that
takes ten seconds to occur, but it's awesome,

471
472
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:34,780
but you need to wait that amount of time.

472
473
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:38,520
So much like a stack, just go ahead and push a timeout,

473
474
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,470
in this case I'm pushing a two second
timeout to the top of my stack.

474
475
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:47,960
I write whatever code that I need that's going to access
these elements whenever I want to wait two seconds

475
476
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,610
to occur, and ultimately I pop the timeout.

476
477
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:58,190
And the whole reason we have this timeout is so
you don't have to pepper your script with delays.

477
478
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:01,070
You might have seen that during Matt's
run, that we had a few delays in there --

478
479
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:06,850
that was purely to slow down the script to make it easier
for you to see what was going on; otherwise it tends to run

479
480
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:09,870
through stuff really quickly and
makes it quite difficult to see.

480
481
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:17,970
But using this, you end up with a robust script, waiting
exactly the right amount of time for something to happen.

481
482
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:23,000
So in summary, what you've seen today
is how you can take UI Automation,

482
483
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,680
how you can write scripts for your application very easily.

483
484
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,010
It's going to cover as much testing as you
can so that you don't need to spend a lot

484
485
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:35,550
of time manually testing your application.

485
486
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:40,110
You can have something do it for
you while you focus on other things.

486
487
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:45,690
There's another session a little later this afternoon on
Accessibility, so if you want to know a little bit more

487
488
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:52,210
about how you can name your elements and interact
with them, a little later this afternoon go

488
489
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,040
to this session, they'll tell you more about it.

489
490
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,450
I've got a couple of resources up here.

490
491
00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:03,280
We've got some documentation that's great, it will
cover all the elements we have and how to write scripts.

491
